  <verse number="1">In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">The LORD has been sore displeased with your fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Therefore say you to them, Thus said the LORD of hosts; Turn you to me, said the LORD of hosts, and I will turn to you, said the LORD of hosts.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Be you not as your fathers, to whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts; Turn you now from your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not hear, nor listen to me, said the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?</verse>
  <verse number="6">But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do to us, according to our ways, and according to our doings, so has he dealt with us.</verse>
  <verse number="7">On the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD to Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo the prophet, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="8">I saw by night, and behold a man riding on a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said to me, I will show you what these be.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are they whom the LORD has sent to walk to and fro through the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the earth, and, behold, all the earth sits still, and is at rest.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts, how long will you not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the cities of Judah, against which you have had indignation these three score and ten years?</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good words and comfortable words.</verse>
  <verse number="14">So the angel that communed with me said to me, Cry you, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore thus said the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with mercies: my house shall be built in it, said the LORD of hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth on Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Cry yet, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts; My cities through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Then lifted I up my eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And I said to the angel that talked with me, What be these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the LORD showed me four carpenters.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then said I, What come these to do? And he spoke, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.</verse>
