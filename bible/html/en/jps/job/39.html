<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="39" data-translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" data-translation-id="jps" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, They cast out their fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Their young ones wax strong, they grow up in the open field; They go forth, and return not again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who hath sent out the wild ass free? Or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Whose house I have made the wilderness, And the salt land his dwelling-place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He scorneth the tumult of the city, Neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The range of the mountains is his pasture, And he searcheth after every green thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Will the wild-ox be willing to serve thee? Or will he abide by thy crib?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow? Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? Or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Wilt thou rely on him, that he will bring home thy seed, And gather the corn of thy threshing-floor?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The wing of the ostrich beateth joyously; But are her pinions and feathers the kindly stork’s?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For she leaveth her eggs on the earth, And warmeth them in dust,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, Or that the wild beast may trample them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">She is hardened against her young ones, as if they were not hers; Though her labour be in vain, she is without fear;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, Neither hath He imparted to her understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">When the time cometh, she raiseth her wings on high, And scorneth the horse and his rider.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Hast thou given the horse his strength? Hast thou clothed his neck with fierceness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Hast thou made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is terrible.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength; He goeth out to meet the clash of arms.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; Neither turneth he back from the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The quiver rattleth upon him, The glittering spear and the javelin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He swalloweth the ground with storm and rage; Neither believeth he that it is the voice of the horn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">As oft as he heareth the horn he saith: ‘Ha, ha!’ And he smelleth the battle afar off, The thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Doth the hawk soar by thy wisdom, And stretch her wings toward the south?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Doth the vulture mount up at thy command, And make her nest on high?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, Upon the crag of the rock, and the stronghold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">From thence she spieth out the prey; Her eyes behold it afar off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Her young ones also suck up blood; And where the slain are, there is she.</p>
