1	In general is fornication heard among you, and such fornication which is not named in the nations, for any to have his fatherâ€™s wife.
2	And ye were puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he having done this work might be taken away from the midst of you.
3	For I truly, as being at a distance in body, and being present in spirit, have already, as being present, judged him having so worked this.
4	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, ye, gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
5	To deliver such a one to Satan for the ruin of the flesh, that the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
6	Your boasting not good. Know ye not that a little leaven may leaven the whole mixture?
7	Therefore cleanse out the old leaven, that ye may be a new mixture, as ye are unleavened. For also our pascha was sacrificed for us, Christ:
8	Therefore let us keep the festival, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of vice and wickedness; but with the unleavened of frankincense and truth.
9	I wrote to you in the epistle not to mix together with fornicators.
10	And not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or the rapacious, or idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.
11	And now I wrote to you not to mix together, if any called a brother is a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or intoxicated, or rapacious; not to eat with such.
12	For what to me also to judge them without? do ye yourselves judge them within.
13	And them without God judges. And take ye away evil from yourselves.
