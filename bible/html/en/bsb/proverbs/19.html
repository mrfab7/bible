<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Better a poor man who walks with integrity than a fool whose lips are perverse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Even zeal is no good without knowledge, and he who hurries his footsteps misses the mark.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A man’s own folly subverts his way, yet his heart rages against the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Wealth attracts many friends, but a poor man is deserted by his friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A false witness will not go unpunished, and one who utters lies will not escape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Many seek the favor of the prince, and everyone is a friend of the gift giver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All the brothers of a poor man hate him—how much more do his friends avoid him! He may pursue them with pleading, but they are nowhere to be found.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He who acquires wisdom loves himself; one who safeguards understanding will find success.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A false witness will not go unpunished, and one who pours out lies will perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Luxury is unseemly for a fool—how much worse for a slave to rule over princes!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">A man’s insight gives him patience, and his virtue is to overlook an offense.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A king’s rage is like the roar of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A foolish son is his father’s ruin, and a quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Houses and wealth are inherited from fathers, but a prudent wife is from the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Laziness brings on deep sleep, and an idle soul will suffer hunger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He who keeps a commandment preserves his soul, but he who is careless in his ways will die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Kindness to the poor is a loan to the LORD, and He will repay the lender.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Discipline your son, for in that there is hope; do not be party to his death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A man of great anger must pay the penalty; if you rescue him, you will have to do so again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Listen to counsel and accept discipline, that you may be wise the rest of your days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Many plans are in a man’s heart, but the purpose of the LORD will prevail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The desire of a man is loving devotion; better to be poor than a liar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The fear of the LORD leads to life, that one may rest content, without visitation from harm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The slacker buries his hand in the dish; he will not even bring it back to his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Strike a mocker, and the simple will beware; rebuke the discerning man, and he will gain knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He who assaults his father or evicts his mother is a son who brings shame and disgrace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">If you cease to hear instruction, my son, you will stray from the words of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A corrupt witness mocks justice, and a wicked mouth swallows iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Judgments are prepared for mockers, and beatings for the backs of fools.</p>
