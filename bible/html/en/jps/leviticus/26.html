<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Ye shall make you no idols, neither shall ye rear you up a graven image, or a pillar, neither shall ye place any figured stone in your land, to bow down unto it; for I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Ye shall keep My sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If ye walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments, and do them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">then I will give your rains in their season, and the land shall yield her produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach unto the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread until ye have enough, and dwell in your land safely.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid; and I will cause evil beasts to cease out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you; and will establish My covenant with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And ye shall eat old store long kept, and ye shall bring forth the old from before the new.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And I will set My tabernacle among you, and My soul shall not abhor you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be My people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">I am the LORD your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But if ye will not hearken unto Me, and will not do all these commandments;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and if ye shall reject My statutes, and if your soul abhor Mine ordinances, so that ye will not do all My commandments, but break My covenant;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I also will do this unto you: I will appoint terror over you, even consumption and fever, that shall make the eyes to fail, and the soul to languish; and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And I will set My face against you, and ye shall be smitten before your enemies; they that hate you shall rule over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And if ye will not yet for these things hearken unto Me, then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield her produce, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And if ye walk contrary unto Me, and will not hearken unto Me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And I will send the beast of the field among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your ways shall become desolate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And if in spite of these things ye will not be corrected unto Me, but will walk contrary unto Me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">then will I also walk contrary unto you; and I will smite you, even I, seven times for your sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall execute the vengeance of the covenant; and ye shall be gathered together within your cities; and I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight; and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And if ye will not for all this hearken unto Me, but walk contrary unto Me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">then I will walk contrary unto you in fury; and I also will chastise you seven times for your sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your sun-pillars, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols; and My soul shall abhor you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And I will make your cities a waste, and will bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet odours.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies that dwell therein shall be astonished at it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And you will I scatter among the nations, and I will draw out the sword after you; and your land shall be a desolation, and your cities shall be a waste.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Then shall the land be paid her sabbaths, as long as it lieth desolate, and ye are in your enemies’ land; even then shall the land rest, and repay her sabbaths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">As long as it lieth desolate it shall have rest; even the rest which it had not in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And as for them that are left of you, I will send a faintness into their heart in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a driven leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as one fleeth from the sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And they shall stumble one upon another, as it were before the sword, when none pursueth; and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, in their treachery which they committed against Me, and also that they have walked contrary unto Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">I also will walk contrary unto them, and bring them into the land of their enemies; if then perchance their uncircumcised heart be humbled, and they then be paid the punishment of their iniquity;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">then will I remember My covenant with Jacob, and also My covenant with Isaac, and also My covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">For the land shall lie forsaken without them, and shall be paid her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them; and they shall be paid the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they rejected Mine ordinances, and their soul abhorred My statutes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break My covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">These are the statutes and ordinances and laws, which the LORD made between Him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.</p>
