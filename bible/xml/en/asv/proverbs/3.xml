  <verse number="1">My son, forget not my law; But let thy heart keep my commandments:</verse>
  <verse number="2">For length of days, and years of life, And peace, will they add to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Let not kindness and truth forsake thee: Bind them about thy neck; Write them upon the tablet of thy heart:</verse>
  <verse number="4">So shalt thou find favor and good understanding In the sight of God and man.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Trust in Jehovah with all thy heart, And lean not upon thine own understanding:</verse>
  <verse number="6">In all thy ways acknowledge him, And he will direct thy paths.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Be not wise in thine own eyes; Fear Jehovah, and depart from evil:</verse>
  <verse number="8">It will be health to thy navel, And marrow to thy bones.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Honor Jehovah with thy substance, And with the first-fruits of all thine increase:</verse>
  <verse number="10">So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, And thy vats shall overflow with new wine.</verse>
  <verse number="11">My son, despise not the chastening of Jehovah; Neither be weary of his reproof:</verse>
  <verse number="12">For whom Jehovah loveth he reproveth; Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, And the man that getteth understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver, And the profit thereof than fine gold.</verse>
  <verse number="15">She is more precious than rubies: And none of the things thou canst desire are to be compared unto her.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Length of days is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honor.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace.</verse>
  <verse number="18">She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: And happy is every one that retaineth her.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding he established the heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="20">By his knowledge the depths were broken up, And the skies drop down the dew.</verse>
  <verse number="21">My son, let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep sound wisdom and discretion:</verse>
  <verse number="22">So shall they be life unto thy soul, And grace to thy neck.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely, And thy foot shall not stumble.</verse>
  <verse number="24">When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Be not afraid of sudden fear, Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh:</verse>
  <verse number="26">For Jehovah will be thy confidence, And will keep thy foot from being taken.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, When it is in the power of thy hand to do it.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Say not unto thy neighbor, Go, and come again, And to-morrow I will give; When thou hast it by thee.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Devise not evil against thy neighbor, Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Strive not with a man without cause, If he have done thee no harm.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Envy thou not the man of violence, And choose none of his ways.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For the perverse is an abomination to Jehovah; But his friendship is with the upright.</verse>
  <verse number="33">The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked; But he blesseth the habitation of the righteous.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Surely he scoffeth at the scoffers; But he giveth grace unto the lowly.</verse>
  <verse number="35">The wise shall inherit glory; But shame shall be the promotion of fools.</verse>
