<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="3" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And this is what he said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">“May the day of my birth perish, and the night it was said, ‘A boy is conceived.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If only that day had turned to darkness! May God above disregard it; may no light shine upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">May darkness and gloom reclaim it, and a cloud settle over it; may the blackness of the day overwhelm it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If only darkness had taken that night away! May it not appear among the days of the year; may it never be entered in any of the months.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, may that night be barren; may no joyful voice come into it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">May it be cursed by those who curse the day—those prepared to rouse Leviathan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">May its morning stars grow dark; may it wait in vain for daylight; may it not see the breaking of dawn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For that night did not shut the doors of the womb to hide the sorrow from my eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Why did I not perish at birth; why did I not die as I came from the womb?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Why were there knees to receive me, and breasts that I should be nursed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For now I would be lying down in peace; I would be asleep and at rest</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">with kings and counselors of the earth, who built for themselves cities now in ruins,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Or why was I not hidden like a stillborn child, like an infant who never sees daylight?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">There the wicked cease from raging, and there the weary find rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The captives enjoy their ease; they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Both small and great are there, and the slave is freed from his master.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Why is light given to the miserable, and life to the bitter of soul,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">who long for death that does not come, and search for it like hidden treasure,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">who rejoice and greatly exult when they reach the grave?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Why is life given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">I sigh when food is put before me, and my groans pour out like water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For the thing I feared has overtaken me, and what I dreaded has befallen me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I am not at ease or quiet; I have no rest, for trouble has come.”</p>
