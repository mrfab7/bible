  <verse number="1">Brethren, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they may be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For I bear them testimony that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For they, being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For Moses describeth the righteousness which is by the law, That the man who doeth these things shall live by them.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But the righteousness which is by faith speaketh on this wise, Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down.)</verse>
  <verse number="7">Or, Who shall descend into the deep? (that is, to bring Christ again from the dead.)</verse>
  <verse number="8">But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach:</verse>
  <verse number="9">That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thy heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For with the heart man believeth to righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made to salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the scripture saith, whoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all, is rich to all that call upon him,</verse>
  <verse number="13">For whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="14">How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</verse>
  <verse number="15">And how shall they preach, except they be sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things?</verse>
  <verse number="16">But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?</verse>
  <verse number="17">So then, faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But I say, Did not Israel know? First, Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But Isaiah is very bold, and saith, I was found by them that sought me not; I was made manifest to them that asked not for me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But to Israel he saith, All day long I have stretched forth my hands to a disobedient and gainsaying people.</verse>
