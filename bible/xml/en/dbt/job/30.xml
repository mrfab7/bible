  <verse number="1">But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Yea, whereto [should] the strength of their hands [profit] me, [men] in whom vigour hath perished?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Withered up through want and hunger, they flee into waste places long since desolate and desert:</verse>
  <verse number="4">They gather the salt-wort among the bushes, and the roots of the broom for their food.</verse>
  <verse number="5">They are driven forth from among [men]—they cry after them as after a thief—</verse>
  <verse number="6">To dwell in gloomy gorges, in caves of the earth and the rocks:</verse>
  <verse number="7">They bray among the bushes; under the brambles they are gathered together:</verse>
  <verse number="8">Sons of fools, and sons of nameless sires, they are driven out of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And now I am their song, yea, I am their byword.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, yea, they spare not to spit in my face.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For he hath loosed my cord and afflicted me; so they cast off the bridle before me.</verse>
  <verse number="12">At [my] right hand rise the young brood; they push away my feet, and raise up against me their pernicious ways;</verse>
  <verse number="13">They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, without any to help them;</verse>
  <verse number="14">They come in as through a wide breach: amid the confusion they roll themselves onward.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Terrors are turned against me; they pursue mine honour as the wind; and my welfare is passed away like a cloud.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And now my soul is poured out in me; days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The night pierceth through my bones [and detacheth them] from me, and my gnawing pains take no rest:</verse>
  <verse number="18">By their great force they have become my raiment; they bind me about as the collar of my coat.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He hath cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes.</verse>
  <verse number="20">I cry unto thee, and thou answerest me not; I stand up, and thou lookest at me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Thou art changed to a cruel one to me; with the strength of thy hand thou pursuest me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to be borne away, and dissolvest my substance.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and into the house of assemblage for all living.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Indeed, no prayer [availeth] when he stretcheth out [his] hand: though they cry when he destroyeth.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Did not I weep for him whose days were hard? was not my soul grieved for the needy?</verse>
  <verse number="26">For I expected good, and there came evil; and I waited for light, but there came darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="27">My bowels well up, and rest not; days of affliction have confronted me.</verse>
  <verse number="28">I go about blackened, but not by the sun; I stand up, I cry in the congregation.</verse>
  <verse number="29">I am become a brother to jackals, and a companion of ostriches.</verse>
  <verse number="30">My skin is become black [and falleth] off me, and my bones are parched with heat.</verse>
  <verse number="31">My harp also is [turned] to mourning, and my pipe into the voice of weepers.</verse>
