<chapter book="Job" number="38" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But the Lord, responding to Job from a whirlwind, said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Who is this that wraps sentences in unskilled words?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Gird your waist like a man. I will question you, and you must answer me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Where were you, when I set the foundations of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Who set its measurements, if you know, or who stretched a line over it?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Upon what have its bases been grounded, and who set forth its cornerstone,</verse>
  <verse number="7">when the morning stars praised me together, and all the sons of God made a joyful noise?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Who enclosed the sea with doors, when it broke forth as if issuing from the womb,</verse>
  <verse number="9">when I stationed a cloud as its garment and wrapped it in a mist as if swaddling an infant?</verse>
  <verse number="10">I encircled it with my limits, and I positioned its bars and doors.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And I said: “This far you will approach, and you will proceeded no further, and here you will break your swelling waves.”</verse>
  <verse number="12">Did you, after your birth, command the birth of the sun and show the sunrise its place?</verse>
  <verse number="13">And did you hold the extremities of the earth, shaking them, and have you shaken the impious out of it?</verse>
  <verse number="14">The seal will be restored like clay, and it will remain in place like a garment.</verse>
  <verse number="15">From the impious, the light will be taken away, and the exalted arm will be broken.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Have you entered the depths of the sea, and have you taken a walk in the uttermost parts of the abyss?</verse>
  <verse number="17">Have the gates of death been opened to you, and have you seen the doors of darkness?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Have you considered the breadth of the earth? If you know all things, reveal them to me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Which is the way that holds the light, and which is the place of darkness?</verse>
  <verse number="20">In this way, you might lead each thing to its final place, and understand the paths of its house.</verse>
  <verse number="21">So then, did you know when you were to be born? And did you know the number of your days?</verse>
  <verse number="22">Have you been admitted into the storehouses of the snows, and have you gazed upon the stockpile of the brimstone,</verse>
  <verse number="23">which I have prepared for the time of the enemy, for the day of the battle and the war?</verse>
  <verse number="24">In what way is the light scattered, and the heat distributed, over the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="25">Who gave a course to the rainstorms, and a path to the resounding thunder,</verse>
  <verse number="26">so that it would rain on the earth far from man, in the wilderness where no mortal lingers,</verse>
  <verse number="27">so that it would fill impassable and desolate places, and would bring forth green plants?</verse>
  <verse number="28">Who is the father of rain, or who conceived the drops of dew?</verse>
  <verse number="29">From whose womb did the ice proceed, and who created the frost from the air?</verse>
  <verse number="30">The waters are hardened to become like stone, and the surface of the abyss freezes over.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Will you have the strength to join together the sparkling stars of the Pleiades, or are you able to disperse the circling of Arcturus?</verse>
  <verse number="32">Can you bring forth the morning star, in its time, and make the evening star rise over the sons of the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="33">Do you know the order of heaven, and can you explain its rules here on the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="34">Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, so that an onslaught of waters will cover you?</verse>
  <verse number="35">Can you send forth lightning bolts, and will they go, and on returning, say to you: “Here we are?”</verse>
  <verse number="36">Who placed discernment in the guts of man, or who gave the rooster intelligence?</verse>
  <verse number="37">Who can describe the rules of the heavens, or who can put to rest the harmony of heaven?</verse>
  <verse number="38">When was the dust cast to become the earth, and when were its clods fastened together?</verse>
  <verse number="39">Will you seize prey for the lioness, and will you sustain the lives of her young,</verse>
  <verse number="40">as they rest in their dens or lie in wait in pits?</verse>
  <verse number="41">Who provides the raven with its meal, when her chicks cry out to God, as they wander around because they have no food?</verse>
