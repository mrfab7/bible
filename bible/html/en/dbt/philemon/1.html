<div class="chapter" data-book="Philemon" data-chapter="1" data-translation="Darby Bible Translation" data-translation-id="dbt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timotheus the brother, to Philemon the beloved and our fellow-workman,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and to the sister Apphia and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the assembly which [is] in thine house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I thank my God, always making mention of thee at my prayers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">hearing of thy love and the faith which thou hast towards the Lord Jesus, and towards all the saints,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">in such sort that thy participation in the faith should become operative in the acknowledgment of every good thing which is in us towards Christ [Jesus].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For we have great thankfulness and encouragement through thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Wherefore having much boldness in Christ to enjoin thee what is fitting,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">for loveâ€™s sake I rather exhort, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now also prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I exhort thee for my child, whom I have begotten in [my] bonds, Onesimus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">once unserviceable to thee, but now serviceable to thee and to me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">whom I have sent back to thee: [but do thou receive] him, that is, my bowels:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">whom I was desirous of keeping with myself, that for thee he might minister to me in the bonds of the glad tidings;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">but I have wished to do nothing without thy mind, that thy good might not be as of necessity but of willingness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">for perhaps for this reason he has been separated [from thee] for a time, that thou mightest possess him fully for ever;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">not any longer as a bondman, but above a bondman, a beloved brother, specially to me, and how much rather to thee, both in [the] flesh and in [the] Lord?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If therefore thou holdest me to be a partner [with thee], receive him as me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">but if he have wronged thee anything or owe anything [to thee], put this to my account.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I Paul have written [it] with mine own hand; I will repay [it]: that I say not to thee that thou owest even thine own self also to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Yea, brother, I would have profit of thee in [the] Lord: refresh my bowels in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Being confident of thine obedience, I have written to thee, knowing that thou wilt do even more than I say.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But withal prepare me also a lodging; for I hope that I shall be granted to you through your prayers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Epaphras salutes thee, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workmen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit.</p>
