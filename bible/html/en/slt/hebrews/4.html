<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Let us therefore fear, lest a solemn promise being left to come into his rest, any of you should seem to have failed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For we also were announced of the good news, as well as they: but the word of the report profited them not, not being mixed with faith to them having heard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For we having believed come into the rest, as he said, As I sware in my wrath, if they shall come into my rest: although the works having been from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For he said somewhere of the seventh thus, And God ceased in the seventh day from all his works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And in this again, If they shall enter into my rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Since therefore it remains for some to come into it, and they before announced of the good news came not in through unbelief:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Again he limits a certain day, saying in David, To day, after such time; as it is said, To day if ye would hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For if Jesus had caused them to rest, he would not have spoken of another day after these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Therefore a celebration of a sabbath remains to the people of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For he having come into his rest, he also has ceased from his works, as God from his own.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Therefore we should be earnest to come into that rest, lest any should fall in the same pattern of unbelief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For the word of God living, and effective, and more piercing than any two-mouthed sword, and penetrating even to the division both of soul and spirit, both the joints and marrows, and a critic of the reflections and thoughts of the heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And there is no creation invisible before him: and all things naked and exposed, neck and face to view, to the eyes of him with whom to us is the word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Having therefore a great chief priest, passed to the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, we should hold firmly the assent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For we have not a chief priest unable to suffer with our weaknesses; but tried in all things as a resemblance, without sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">We should therefore go with freedom of speech to the throne of grace, that we receive mercy, and find grace for timely assistance.</p>
