<chapter book="1 Timothy" number="2" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, be made for all men;</verse>
  <verse number="2">for kings and all that are in high place; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and gravity.</verse>
  <verse number="3">This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;</verse>
  <verse number="4">who willeth that all men should be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For there is one God, one mediator also between God and men, himself man, Christ Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="6">who gave himself a ransom for all; the testimony to be borne in its own times;</verse>
  <verse number="7">whereunto I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth, I lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I desire therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and disputing.</verse>
  <verse number="9">In like manner, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefastness and sobriety; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly raiment;</verse>
  <verse number="10">but (which becometh women professing godliness) through good works.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For Adam was first formed, then Eve;</verse>
  <verse number="14">and Adam was not beguiled, but the woman being beguiled hath fallen into transgression:</verse>
  <verse number="15">but she shall be saved through the childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and sanctification with sobriety.</verse>
