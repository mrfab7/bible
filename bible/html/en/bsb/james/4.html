<div class="chapter" data-book="James" data-chapter="4" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">What causes conflicts and quarrels among you? Don’t they come from the passions at war within you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">You crave what you do not have; you kill and covet, but are unable to obtain it. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And when you do ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may squander it on your pleasures.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">You adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore, whoever chooses to be a friend of the world renders himself an enemy of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Or do you think the Scripture says without reason that the Spirit He caused to dwell in us yearns with envy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But He gives us more grace. This is why it says: “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Grieve, mourn, and weep. Turn your laughter to mourning, and your joy to gloom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will exalt you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Brothers, do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against his brother or judges him speaks against the law and judges it. And if you judge the law, you are not a practitioner of the law, but a judge of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business, and make a profit.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">You do not even know what will happen tomorrow! What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Instead, you ought to say, “If the Lord is willing, we will live and do this or that.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">As it is, you boast in your proud intentions. All such boasting is evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Anyone, then, who knows the right thing to do, yet fails to do it, is guilty of sin.</p>
