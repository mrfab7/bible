  <verse number="1">“Do you know the time when the mountain goats give birth? Do you watch when the doe bears fawns?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Can you number the months that they fulfill? Or do you know the time when they give birth?</verse>
  <verse number="3">They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, they end their labor pains.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Their young ones become strong. They grow up in the open field. They go forth, and don’t return again.</verse>
  <verse number="5">“Who has set the wild donkey free? Or who has loosened the bonds of the swift donkey,</verse>
  <verse number="6">Whose home I have made the wilderness, and the salt land his dwelling place?</verse>
  <verse number="7">He scorns the tumult of the city, neither does he hear the shouting of the driver.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The range of the mountains is his pasture, He searches after every green thing.</verse>
  <verse number="9">“Will the wild ox be content to serve you? Or will he stay by your feeding trough?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Can you hold the wild ox in the furrow with his harness? Or will he till the valleys after you?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Will you trust him, because his strength is great? Or will you leave to him your labor?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Will you confide in him, that he will bring home your seed, and gather the grain of your threshing floor?</verse>
  <verse number="13">“The wings of the ostrich wave proudly; but are they the feathers and plumage of love?</verse>
  <verse number="14">For she leaves her eggs on the earth, warms them in the dust,</verse>
  <verse number="15">and forgets that the foot may crush them, or that the wild animal may trample them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">She deals harshly with her young ones, as if they were not hers. Though her labor is in vain, she is without fear,</verse>
  <verse number="17">because God has deprived her of wisdom, neither has he imparted to her understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="18">When she lifts up herself on high, she scorns the horse and his rider.</verse>
  <verse number="19">“Have you given the horse might? Have you clothed his neck with a quivering mane?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Have you made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is awesome.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength. He goes out to meet the armed men.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed, neither does he turn back from the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The quiver rattles against him, the flashing spear and the javelin.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He eats up the ground with fierceness and rage, neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet.</verse>
  <verse number="25">As often as the trumpet sounds he snorts, ‘Aha!’ He smells the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</verse>
  <verse number="26">“Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars, and stretches her wings toward the south?</verse>
  <verse number="27">Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up, and makes his nest on high?</verse>
  <verse number="28">On the cliff he dwells, and makes his home, on the point of the cliff, and the stronghold.</verse>
  <verse number="29">From there he spies out the prey. His eyes see it afar off.</verse>
  <verse number="30">His young ones also suck up blood. Where the slain are, there he is.”</verse>
