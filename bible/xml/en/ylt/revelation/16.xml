<chapter book="Revelation" number="16" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And I heard a great voice out of the sanctuary saying to the seven messengers, ‘Go away, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God to the earth;’</verse>
  <verse number="2">and the first did go away, and did pour out his vial upon the land, and there came a sore—bad and grievous—to men, those having the mark of the beast, and those bowing to his image.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the second messenger did pour out his vial to the sea, and there came blood as of one dead, and every living soul died in the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the third messenger did pour out his vial to the rivers, and to the fountains of the waters, and there came blood,</verse>
  <verse number="5">and I heard the messenger of the waters, saying, ‘righteous, O Lord, art Thou, who art, and who wast, and who shalt be, because these things Thou didst judge,</verse>
  <verse number="6">because blood of saints and prophets they did pour out, and blood to them Thou didst give to drink, for they are worthy;’</verse>
  <verse number="7">and I heard another out of the altar, saying, ‘Yes, Lord God, the Almighty, true and righteous are Thy judgments.’</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the fourth messenger did pour out his vial upon the sun, and there was given to him to scorch men with fire,</verse>
  <verse number="9">and men were scorched with great heat, and they did speak evil of the name of God, who hath authority over these plagues, and they did not reform—to give to Him glory.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the fifth messenger did pour out his vial upon the throne of the beast, and his kingdom did become darkened, and they were gnawing their tongues from the pain,</verse>
  <verse number="11">and they did speak evil of the God of the heaven, from their pains, and from their sores, and they did not reform from their works.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the sixth messenger did pour out his vial upon the great river, the Euphrates, and dried up was its water, that the way of the kings who are from the rising of the sun may be made ready;</verse>
  <verse number="13">and I saw come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs—</verse>
  <verse number="14">for they are spirits of demons, doing signs—which go forth unto the kings of the earth, and of the whole world, to bring them together to the battle of that great day of God the Almighty;—</verse>
  <verse number="15">lo, I do come as a thief; happy is he who is watching, and keeping his garments, that he may not walk naked, and they may see his unseemliness,’—</verse>
  <verse number="16">and they did bring them together to the place that is called in Hebrew Armageddon.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the seventh messenger did pour out his vial to the air, and there came forth a great voice from the sanctuary of the heaven, from the throne, saying, ‘It hath come!’</verse>
  <verse number="18">and there came voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and a great earthquake came, such as came not since men came upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake—so great!</verse>
  <verse number="19">And it came—the great city—into three parts, and the cities of the nations did fall, and Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give to her the cup of the wine of the wrath of His anger,</verse>
  <verse number="20">and every island did flee away, and mountains were not found,</verse>
  <verse number="21">and great hail (as of talent weight) doth come down out of the heaven upon men, and men did speak evil of God because of the plague of the hail, because its plague is very great.</verse>
