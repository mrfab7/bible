  <verse number="1">And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was there a man having his hand dried up.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And they watched him if he would heal him on the sabbath, that they might accuse him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he says to the man who had his hand dried up, Rise up [and come] into the midst.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he says to them, Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill? But they were silent.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And looking round upon them with anger, distressed at the hardening of their heart, he says to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched [it] out, and his hand was restored.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the Pharisees going out straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea; and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea and beyond the Jordan; and they of around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, having heard what things he did, came to him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he spoke to his disciples, in order that a little ship should wait upon him on account of the crowd, that they might not press upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For he healed many, so that they beset him that they might touch him, as many as had plagues.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the unclean spirits, when they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried saying, Thou art the Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he rebuked them much, that they might not make him manifest.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he goes up into the mountain, and calls whom he himself would, and they went to him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he appointed twelve that they might be with him, and that he might send them to preach,</verse>
  <verse number="15">and to have power [to heal diseases, and] to cast out demons.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he gave to Simon the surname of Peter;</verse>
  <verse number="17">and James the [son] of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, and he gave them the surname of Boanerges, that is, Sons of thunder;</verse>
  <verse number="18">and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the [son] of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,</verse>
  <verse number="19">and Judas Iscariote, who also delivered him up. And they come to [the] house.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And again a crowd comes together, so that they cannot even eat bread.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And his relatives having heard [of it] went out to lay hold on him, for they said, He is out of his mind.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and, By the prince of the demons he casts out demons.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And having called them to [him], he said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
  <verse number="24">And if a kingdom has become divided against itself, that kingdom cannot subsist.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And if a house has become divided against itself, that house cannot subsist.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And if Satan rise up against himself, and is divided, he cannot subsist, but has an end.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But no one can, having entered into his house, plunder the goods of the strong [man] unless he first bind the strong [man], and then he will plunder his house.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Verily I say unto you, that all sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and all the injurious speeches [with] which they may speak injuriously;</verse>
  <verse number="29">but whosoever shall speak injuriously against the Holy Spirit, to eternity has no forgiveness; but lies under the guilt of an everlasting sin;</verse>
  <verse number="30">because they said, he has an unclean spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And his brethren and his mother come, and standing without sent to him calling him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And a crowd sat around him. And they said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren seek thee without.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother or my brethren?</verse>
  <verse number="34">And looking around in a circuit at those that were sitting around him, he says, Behold my mother and my brethren:</verse>
  <verse number="35">for whosoever shall do the will of God, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.</verse>
