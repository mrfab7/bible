<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Then I put my brother Hanani in charge of Jerusalem, along with Hananiah the commander of the fortress, because he was a faithful man who feared God more than most.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I told them, “Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is hot. While the guards are on duty, keep the doors shut and securely fastened. And appoint the residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at their posts and some at their own homes.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Now the city was large and spacious, but there were few people in it, and the houses had not yet been rebuilt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then my God put it into my heart to assemble the nobles, the officials, and the people to be enrolled by genealogy. I found the genealogical register of those who had first returned, and I found the following written in it:</p>
