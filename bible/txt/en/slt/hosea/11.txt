1	When Israel was a child, and I loved him, and I called for my son out of Egypt.
2	They called to them, thus they went from them: they will sacrifice to the Baals, and to the carved images they will burn incense.
3	And I taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by their arms; and they knew not that I healed them.
4	I will draw them with the cords of man, with the bands of love: and I will be to them as those lifting up the yoke upon their jaw-bones, and I will gently give them to eat.
5	He shall not turn back to the land of Egypt, and Assur shall be his king, for they refused to turn back.
6	And the sword was polished in his cities, and it consumed his branches, and devoured from their counsels.
7	And my people are bent to turning away from me: and they will call together to the Most High; he will not exalt them.
8	How shall I give thee up, O Ephraim? Shall I deliver thee over, O Israel? How shall I give thee as the earth? Shall I set thee as roes? My heart was turned upon me; my grievings were kindled together.
9	I will not do the burning of mine anger, I will not turn back to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not a man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not come into the city.
10	They shall go after Jehovah: as a lion shall he roar: for he shall roar, and the sons of the waters shall tremble.
11	They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assur: and I caused them to dwell in their houses, says Jehovah.
12	Ephraim surrounded me with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit: and Judah even ruled with God, and was faithful with the holy ones.
