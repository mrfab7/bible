  <verse number="1">I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?</verse>
  <verse number="2">For what portion of God [is there] from above? and [what] inheritance of the Almighty from on high?</verse>
  <verse number="3">[Is] not destruction to the wicked? and a strange [punishment] to the workers of iniquity?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?</verse>
  <verse number="5">If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;</verse>
  <verse number="6">Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity.</verse>
  <verse number="7">If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;</verse>
  <verse number="8">[Then] let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.</verse>
  <verse number="9">If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or [if] I have laid wait at my neighbour’s door;</verse>
  <verse number="10">[Then] let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For this [is] an heinous crime; yea, it [is] an iniquity [to be punished by] the judges.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For it [is] a fire [that] consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;</verse>
  <verse number="14">What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?</verse>
  <verse number="16">If I have withheld the poor from [their] desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;</verse>
  <verse number="17">Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;</verse>
  <verse number="18">(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as [with] a father, and I have guided her from my mother’s womb;)</verse>
  <verse number="19">If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;</verse>
  <verse number="20">If his loins have not blessed me, and [if] he were [not] warmed with the fleece of my sheep;</verse>
  <verse number="21">If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:</verse>
  <verse number="22">[Then] let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For destruction [from] God [was] a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.</verse>
  <verse number="24">If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, [Thou art] my confidence;</verse>
  <verse number="25">If I rejoiced because my wealth [was] great, and because mine hand had gotten much;</verse>
  <verse number="26">If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking [in] brightness;</verse>
  <verse number="27">And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:</verse>
  <verse number="28">This also [were] an iniquity [to be punished by] the judge: for I should have denied the God [that is] above.</verse>
  <verse number="29">If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:</verse>
  <verse number="30">Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.</verse>
  <verse number="31">If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.</verse>
  <verse number="32">The stranger did not lodge in the street: [but] I opened my doors to the traveller.</verse>
  <verse number="33">If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:</verse>
  <verse number="34">Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, [and] went not out of the door?</verse>
  <verse number="35">Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire [is, that] the Almighty would answer me, and [that] mine adversary had written a book.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, [and] bind it [as] a crown to me.</verse>
  <verse number="37">I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.</verse>
  <verse number="38">If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;</verse>
  <verse number="39">If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:</verse>
  <verse number="40">Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.</verse>
