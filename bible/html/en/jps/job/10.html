<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My soul is weary of my life; I will give free course to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I will say unto God: Do not condemn me; Make me know wherefore Thou contendest with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is it good unto Thee that Thou shouldest oppress, That Thou shouldest despise the work of Thy hands, And shine upon the counsel of the wicked?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Hast Thou eyes of flesh? Or seest Thou as man seeth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Are Thy days as the days of man, Or Thy years as a man’s days,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">That Thou inquirest after mine iniquity, And searchest after my sin,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Although Thou knowest that I shall not be condemned; And there is none that can deliver out of Thy hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Thy hands have framed me and fashioned me Together round about; yet Thou dost destroy me!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Remember, I beseech Thee, that Thou hast fashioned me as clay; And wilt Thou bring me into dust again?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Hast Thou not poured me out as milk, And curdled me like cheese?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Thou hast granted me life and favour, And Thy providence hath preserved my spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Yet these things Thou didst hide in Thy heart; I know that this is with Thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If I sin, then Thou markest me, And Thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If I be wicked, woe unto me; And if I be righteous, yet shall I not lift up my head—Being filled with ignominy And looking upon mine affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And if it exalt itself, Thou huntest me as a lion; And again Thou showest Thyself marvellous upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Thou renewest Thy witnesses against me, And increasest Thine indignation upon me; Host succeeding host against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Wherefore then hast Thou brought me forth out of the womb? Would that I had perished, and no eye had seen me!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Are not my days few? Cease then, And let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Before I go whence I shall not return, Even to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A land of thick darkness, as darkness itself; A land of the shadow of death, without any order, And where the light is as darkness.</p>
