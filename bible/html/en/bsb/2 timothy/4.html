<div class="chapter" data-book="2 Timothy" data-chapter="4" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who will judge the living and the dead, and in view of His appearing and His kingdom:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and encourage with every form of patient instruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the time will come when men will not tolerate sound doctrine, but with itching ears they will gather around themselves teachers to suit their own desires.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">So they will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But you, be sober in all things, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time of my departure is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">From now on there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that dayâ€”and not only to me, but to all who crave His appearing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Make every effort to come to me quickly,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">because Demas, in his love of this world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, because he is useful to me in the ministry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Tychicus, however, I have sent to Ephesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and my scrolls, especially the parchments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Alexander the coppersmith did great harm to me. The Lord will repay him according to his deeds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">You too should beware of him, for he has vigorously opposed our message.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">At my first defense, no one stood with me, but everyone deserted me. May it not be charged against them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message would be fully proclaimed, and all the Gentiles would hear it. So I was delivered from the mouth of the lion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the Lord will rescue me from every evil action and bring me safely into His heavenly kingdom. To Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Greet Prisca and Aquila, as well as the household of Onesiphorus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Erastus has remained at Corinth, and Trophimus I left sick in Miletus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Make every effort to come to me before winter. Eubulus sends you greetings, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you all.</p>
