<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Remember, O Jehovah, what was to us: look and see our reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Our inheritance was turned to strangers, our houses to foreigners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">We were orphans, no father; our mothers as widows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">We drank our water for silver; our wood will come for a price.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Upon our necks were we pursued: we labored and no rest to us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">We gave the hand to Egypt, to Assur, to be filled with bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Our fathers sinned, they are not; we bore their iniquities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Servants ruled over us: none delivering from their hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">With our souls we shall bring our bread from the face of the sword of the desert.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Our skin was scorched as a furnace from the face of the violent heat of famine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They humbled the women in Zion the virgins in the cities of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Chiefs were hung by their hand: the faces of old men were not honored.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They took away the chosen ones to grind, and the young men were weak in the wood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Old men ceased from the gate, the chosen ones from their stringed instruments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The joy of our heart ceased; our dance was turned to mourning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The crown of our head fell: wo! now to us, for we sinned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For this our heart was languid; for this our eyes were darkened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For mount Zion was laid waste, the foxes went upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thou, O Jehovah, shalt dwell forever; thy throne to generation and generation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Wherefore wilt thou forget us forever? wilt thou forsake us to length of days?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Turn us back, O Jehovah, to thee, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But rejecting, thou didst reject us; thou wert angry against us even greatly.</p>
