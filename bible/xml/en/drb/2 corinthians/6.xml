  <verse number="1">And we helping do exhort you, that you receive not the grace of God in vain.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For he saith: In an accepted time have I heard thee; and in the day of salvation have I helped thee. Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Giving no offence to any man, that our ministry be not blamed:</verse>
  <verse number="4">But in all things let us exhibit ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulation, in necessities, in distresses,</verse>
  <verse number="5">In stripes, in prisons, in seditions, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,</verse>
  <verse number="6">In chastity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in sweetness, in the Holy Ghost, in charity unfeigned,</verse>
  <verse number="7">In the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armour of justice on the right hand and on the left;</verse>
  <verse number="8">By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet known;</verse>
  <verse number="9">As dying, and behold we live; as chastised, and not killed;</verse>
  <verse number="10">As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as needy, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Our mouth is open to you, O ye Corinthians, our heart is enlarged.</verse>
  <verse number="12">You are not straitened in us, but in your own bowels you are straitened.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But having the same recompense, (I speak as to my children,) be you also enlarged.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Bear not the yoke with unbelievers. For what participation hath justice with injustice? Or what fellowship hath light with darkness?</verse>
  <verse number="15">And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath the faithful with the unbeliever?</verse>
  <verse number="16">And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God; as God saith: I will dwell in them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Wherefore, Go out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing:</verse>
  <verse number="18">And I will receive you; and I will be a Father to you; and you shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</verse>
