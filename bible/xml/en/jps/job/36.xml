  <verse number="1">Elihu also proceeded, and said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Suffer me a little, and I will tell thee; For there are yet words on God’s behalf.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For truly my words are not false; One that is upright in mind is with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Behold, God is mighty, yet He despiseth not any; He is mighty in strength of understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He preserveth not the life of the wicked; But giveth to the poor their right.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He withdraweth not His eyes from the righteous; But with kings upon the throne He setteth them for ever, and they are exalted.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And if they be bound in fetters, And be holden in cords of affliction;</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then He declareth unto them their work, And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He openeth also their ear to discipline, And commandeth that they return from iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If they hearken and serve Him, They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But they that are godless in heart lay up anger; They cry not for help when He bindeth them.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Their soul perisheth in youth, And their life as that of the depraved.</verse>
  <verse number="15">He delivereth the afflicted by His affliction, And openeth their ear by tribulation.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Yea, He hath allured thee out of distress Into a broad place, where there is no straitness; And that which is set on thy table is full of fatness;</verse>
  <verse number="17">And thou art full of the judgment of the wicked; Judgment and justice take hold on them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For beware of wrath, lest thou be led away by thy sufficiency; Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Will thy riches avail, that are without stint, Or all the forces of thy strength?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Desire not the night, When peoples are cut off in their place.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Take heed, regard not iniquity; For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Behold, God doeth loftily in His power; Who is a teacher like Him?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Who hath enjoined Him His way? Or who hath said: ‘Thou hast wrought unrighteousness’?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Remember that thou magnify His work, Whereof men have sung.</verse>
  <verse number="25">All men have looked thereon; Man beholdeth it afar off.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Behold, God is great, beyond our knowledge; The number of His years is unsearchable.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For He draweth away the drops of water, Which distil rain from His vapour;</verse>
  <verse number="28">Which the skies pour down And drop upon the multitudes of men.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, The crashings of His pavilion?</verse>
  <verse number="30">Behold, He spreadeth His light upon it; And He covereth the depths of the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="31">For by these He judgeth the peoples; He giveth food in abundance.</verse>
  <verse number="32">He covereth His hands with the lightning, And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark.</verse>
  <verse number="33">The noise thereof telleth concerning it, The cattle also concerning the storm that cometh up.</verse>
