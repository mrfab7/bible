<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">You, son of man, thus says the Lord Yahweh to the land of Israel, An end: the end has come on the four corners of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Now is the end on you, and I will send my anger on you, and will judge you according to your ways; and I will bring on you all your abominations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">My eye shall not spare you, neither will I have pity; but I will bring your ways on you, and your abominations shall be in the midst of you: and you shall know that I am Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thus says the Lord Yahweh: An evil, an only evil; behold, it comes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">An end has come, the end has come; it awakes against you; behold, it comes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Your doom has come to you, inhabitant of the land: the time has come, the day is near, a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting, on the mountains.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Now will I shortly pour out my wrath on you, and accomplish my anger against you, and will judge you according to your ways; and I will bring on you all your abominations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">My eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will bring on you according to your ways; and your abominations shall be in the midst of you; and you shall know that I, Yahweh, do strike.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Behold, the day, behold, it comes: your doom is gone forth; the rod has blossomed, pride has budded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Violence has risen up into a rod of wickedness. None of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth. There shall be nothing of value among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The time has come, the day draws near: donâ€™t let the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is on all its multitude.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude of it, none shall return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but none goes to the battle; for my wrath is on all its multitude.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The sword is outside, and the pestilence and the famine within: he who is in the field shall die with the sword: and he who is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But those of those who escape shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, every one in his iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">They shall also clothe themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be on all faces, and baldness on all their heads.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of Yahweh: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels; because it has been the stumbling block of their iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty; but they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein: therefore have I made it to them as an unclean thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">My face will I turn also from them, and they shall profane my secret place; and robbers shall enter into it, and profane it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Therefore I will bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Destruction comes; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Mischief shall come on mischief, and rumor shall be on rumor; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do to them after their way, and according to their own judgments will I judge them; and they shall know that I am Yahweh.</p>
