<chapter book="Job" number="13" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">See, my eye has seen all this, my ear has heard and understood it.</verse>
  <verse number="2">What you know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior to you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But you are forgers of lies, you are all physicians of no value.</verse>
  <verse number="5">O that you would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Hear now my reasoning, and listen to the pleadings of my lips.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Will you speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Will you accept his person? will you contend for God?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocks another, do you so mock him?</verse>
  <verse number="10">He will surely reprove you, if you do secretly accept persons.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall on you?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Your remembrances are like to ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Why do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain my own ways before him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Only do not two things to me: then will I not hide myself from you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Withdraw your hand far from me: and let not your dread make me afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Then call you, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer you me.</verse>
  <verse number="23">How many are my iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Why hide you your face, and hold me for your enemy?</verse>
  <verse number="25">Will you break a leaf driven to and fro? and will you pursue the dry stubble?</verse>
  <verse number="26">For you write bitter things against me, and make me to possess the iniquities of my youth.</verse>
  <verse number="27">You put my feet also in the stocks, and look narrowly to all my paths; you set a print on the heels of my feet.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And he, as a rotten thing, consumes, as a garment that is moth eaten.</verse>
