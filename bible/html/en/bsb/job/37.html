<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“At this my heart also pounds and leaps from its place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Listen closely to the thunder of His voice and the rumbling that comes from His mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He unleashes His lightning beneath the whole sky and sends it to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Then there comes a roaring sound; He thunders with His majestic voice. He does not restrain the lightning when His voice resounds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">God thunders wondrously with His voice; He does great things we cannot comprehend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For He says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’ and to the gentle rain, ‘Pour out a mighty downpour.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He seals up the hand of every man, so that all men may know His work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The wild animals enter their lairs; they settle down in their dens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The tempest comes from its chamber, and the cold from the driving north winds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">By the breath of God the ice is formed and the watery expanses are frozen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He loads the clouds with moisture; He scatters His lightning through them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They swirl about, whirling at His direction, accomplishing all that He commands over the face of all the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whether for punishment or for His land, He accomplishes this in His loving devotion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Listen to this, O Job; stand still and consider the wonders of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Do you know how God dispatches the clouds or makes the lightning flash?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Do you understand how the clouds float, those wonders of Him who is perfect in knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">You whose clothes get hot when the land lies hushed under the south wind,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">can you, like Him, spread out the skies, as strong as a mirror of bronze?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Teach us what we should say to Him; we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Should He be told that I want to speak? Would a man ask to be swallowed up?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Now no one can gaze at the sun when it is bright in the skies after the wind has swept them clean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Out of the north He comes in golden splendor; awesome majesty surrounds Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The Almighty is beyond our reach; He is exalted in power! In His justice and great righteousness He does not oppress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Therefore, men fear Him, for He is not partial to the wise in heart.”</p>
