  <verse number="1">O Jehovah, my God art Thou, I exalt Thee, I confess Thy name, For Thou hast done a wonderful thing, Counsels of old, stedfastness, O stedfast One.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For Thou didst make of a city a heap, Of a fenced city a ruin, A high place of strangers from being a city, To the age it is not built.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Therefore honour Thee do a strong people, A city of the terrible nations feareth Thee.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For Thou hast been a stronghold for the poor, A stronghold for the needy in his distress, A refuge from storm, a shadow from heat, When the spirit of the terrible is as a storm—a wall.</verse>
  <verse number="5">As heat in a dry place, The noise of strangers Thou humblest, Heat with the shadow of a thick cloud, The singing of the terrible is humbled.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And made hath Jehovah of Hosts, For all the peoples in this mount, A banquet of fat things, a banquet of preserved things, Fat things full of marrow, preserved things refined.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And swallowed up hath He in this mountain The face of the wrapping that is wrapped over all the peoples, And of the covering that is spread over all the nations.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He hath swallowed up death in victory, And wiped hath the Lord Jehovah, The tear from off all faces, And the reproach of His people He turneth aside from off all the earth, For Jehovah hath spoken.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And one hath said in that day, ‘Lo, this is our God, We waited for Him, and He saveth us, This is Jehovah, we have waited for Him, We joy and rejoice in His salvation.’</verse>
  <verse number="10">For rest doth the hand of Jehovah on this mountain, And trodden down is Moab under Him, As trodden down is straw on a dunghill.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he spread out his hands in its midst, As spread out doth the swimmer to swim; And He hath humbled his excellency With the machinations of his hands.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the fortress of the high place of thy walls He hath bowed down—He hath made low, He hath caused it to come to the earth,—unto dust.</verse>
