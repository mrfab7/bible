  <verse number="1">Man born of a woman, living for a short time, is filled with many miseries.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Who cometh forth like a flower, and is destroyed, and fleeth as a shadow, and never continueth in the same state.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And dost thou think it meet to open thy eyes upon such an one, and to bring him into judgment with thee?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who can make him clean that is conceived of unclean seed ? is it not thou who only art?</verse>
  <verse number="5">The days of man are short, and the number of his months is with thee: thou hast appointed his bounds which cannot be passed.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Depart a little from him, that he may rest, until his wished for day come, as that of the hireling.</verse>
  <verse number="7">A tree hath hope: if it be cut, it groweth green again, and the boughs thereof sprout.</verse>
  <verse number="8">If its root be old in the earth, and its stock be dead in the dust:</verse>
  <verse number="9">At the scent of water, it shall spring, and bring forth leaves, as when it was first planted.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But man when he shall be dead, and stripped and consumed, I pray you where is he?</verse>
  <verse number="11">As if the waters should depart out of the sea, and an emptied river should be dried up:</verse>
  <verse number="12">So man when he is fallen asleep shall not rise again; till the heavens be broken, he shall not awake, nor rise up out of his sleep.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who will grant me this, that thou mayest protect me in hell, and hide me till thy wrath pass, and appoint me a. time when thou wilt remember me?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Shall man that is dead, thinkest thou, live again? all the days in which I am now in warfare, I expect until my change come.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thou shalt call me, and I will answer thee: to the work of thy hands thou shalt reach out thy right hand.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Thou indeed hast numbered my steps, but spare my sins.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Thou hast sealed up my offences as it were in a bag, but hast cured my iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="18">A mountain falling cometh to nought, and a rock is removed out of its place.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Waters wear away the stones, and with inundation the ground by little and little is washed away: so in like manner thou shalt destroy man.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Thou hast strengthened him for a little while, that he may pass away for ever: thou shalt change his face, and shalt send him away.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Whether his children come to honour or dishonour, he shall not understand.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But yet his flesh, while he shall live, shall have pain, and his soul shall mourn over him.</verse>
