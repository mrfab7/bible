  <verse number="1">And after two days was the pascha, and the unleavened loaves: and the chief priests and scribes sought how, having taken him by fraud, they might kill.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And they said, Not in the festival, lest there be an uproar of the people.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leprous, he reclining at table, a woman came having an alabaster box of perfumed oil of persuasive, costly, spikenard; and having broken the alabaster box, she poured upon his head.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And there were some displeased in themselves, and saying, For what has been the loss of this perfumed oil?</verse>
  <verse number="5">For this could have been sold for above three hundred drachmas, and have been given to the poor. And they raged against her.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Jesus said, Let her go; why bestow ye weariness upon her? she has wrought a good work upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For always have ye the poor with you, and when ye wish ye can do them good: and me ye have not always.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And what she had, she has done: she has undertaken beforehand to perfume my body for the burial.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Truly I say to you, Wherever this good news be proclaimed in the whole world, also what she has done shall be spoken for a memorial of her.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might deliver him to them.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And having heard, they rejoiced, and promised to give him silver. And he sought how he might opportunely deliver him up.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And in the first day of the unleavened, when they sacrificed the pascha, his disciples say to him, Where wilt thou, we, having gone, should prepare that thou eat the pascha.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he sends two of his disciples, and says to them, Retire to the city, and a man shall meet you bearing an earthen vessel of water; follow him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And wherever he should enter in, say to the lord of the house, That the Teacher says, Where is the room where I might eat the pascha with my disciples?</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he will shew you a great apartment spread, ready: there prepare for us.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And his disciples went out, and came to the city, and found as he said to them: and they prepared the pascha.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And having been evening, he comes with the twelve.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And they reclining and eating, Jesus said, Truly I say to you, That one of you shall deliver me up, he eating with me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And they began to be grieved, and to say to him one by one, What, not I? and another, What, not I?</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he having answered, said to them, One of the twelve, he dipping with me into the small dish.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Truly the Son of man retires, as has been written of him: and woe to that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up! it were good for him if that man had not been born.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And they eating, Jesus having taken bread, having praised, brake, and gave them, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And having taken the cup, having returned thanks, he gave them: and they all drank of it.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And he said to them, This is my blood, that of the new covenant, being poured out for many.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Truly I say to you, that I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine, till that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And having sung, they came out to the mount of Olives.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And Jesus says to them, That all ye shall be offended with me in this night: for it has been written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But after I have risen, I will lead before you into Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Peter said to him, And if all shall be offended, yet not I.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And Jesus says to him, Truly I say to thee, That to day, in this night, surely before the cock has uttered a sound twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And he said more excessively, If I should die with thee, I shall not deny thee. And so likewise they all said.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And they came to a place, the name of which Gethsemane: and he says to his disciples, Sit here, while I shall pray.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And he takes Peter and James and John with himself, and began to be amazed, and to be dejected.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And he says to them, My soul is sorely grieved, even to death: remain here, and watch.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And having gone forward a little, he fell upon the earth and prayed that, if it be possible, the hour might pass away from him.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And he said, Abba, Father, all things possible to thee; turn away this cup from me: but not what I will, but what thou.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And he comes, and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, Simon, sleepest thou? could eat thou not watch one Hour?</verse>
  <verse number="38">Watch ye and pray, that ye should not come into temptation. Truly the spirit well inclined, and the flesh weak.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And again having gone away, he prayed; saying the same word.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And having turned back, he found them again sleeping, (for their eyes were loaded,) and they knew not what they might answer him.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And he comes the third time, and says to them, Sleep the remaining time, and take rest: it is sufficient, the hour has come; behold, the Son of man is delivered into the hands of the sinful.</verse>
  <verse number="42">Arise, and let us lead; behold, he delivering me up has drawn near.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And quickly, he yet speaking, Judas approaches, being one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and sticks from the chief priests and scribes and the more ancient.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And he delivering him up gave them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, this is he; seize him, and lead away safely.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And having come, quickly having approached him, he says, Rabbi, rabbi; and kissed him.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And they put their hands on him, and seized him.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And a certain one of them standing by, having drawn a sword, struck the chief priest’s servant, and took away his ear.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And Jesus having answered, said to them, As against a robber come ye out, with swords and sticks to take me.</verse>
  <verse number="49">Daily was I with you in the temple teaching, and ye seized me not: but that the writings might be completed.</verse>
  <verse number="50">And having left him, they all fled.</verse>
  <verse number="51">And one certain young man followed him, having cast a garment of fine linen over his nakedness; and the young men seized him:</verse>
  <verse number="52">And having left the fine linen garment, he fled from them naked.</verse>
  <verse number="53">And they led Jesus away to the pontificate: and all the chief priests and elders and scribes came with him.</verse>
  <verse number="54">And Peter followed him from far, even to within the court-yard of the chief priest: and he was sitting with the attendants, and warming himself near the light.</verse>
  <verse number="55">And the chief priests and the whole council sought testimony against Jesus, to put him to death; and found not:</verse>
  <verse number="56">For many testified falsely against him, and the testimonies were not alike.</verse>
  <verse number="57">And certain having risen up testified falsely against him, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="58">That we heard him saying, That I will abolish this temple made with hands, and in three days will I build another, made without hands.</verse>
  <verse number="59">And neither so was their testimony alike.</verse>
  <verse number="60">And the chief priest having risen up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing? what these testify against thee.</verse>
  <verse number="61">And he was silent, and answered nothing. Again the chief priest asks him, and says to him, Art thou Christ, Son of the Praised.</verse>
  <verse number="62">And Jesus said, I am: and ye shall see the Son of man sitting from the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="63">And the chief priest, having rent his tunic, says, What further need have we of witnesses.</verse>
  <verse number="64">Ye have heard the blasphemy; How does it appear to you? And they all condemned him to be liable to the penalty of death.</verse>
  <verse number="65">And certain began to spit upon him, and to cover his face, and to cuff him, and to say to him, Prophesy: and the attendants struck him blows with rods.</verse>
  <verse number="66">And Peter being in the hall how, one of the chief priest’s young girls comes:</verse>
  <verse number="67">And seeing Peter warming himself, having looked upon him, she says, And thou wast with Jesus the Nazarene.</verse>
  <verse number="68">And he denied, saying, I know not, neither understand what thou sayest. And he went forth without into the vestibule; and the cock uttered a sound.</verse>
  <verse number="69">And the young girl seeing him again, began to say to, them standing by, That this is of them: and again he denied.</verse>
  <verse number="70">And after a little, again they standing by said to Peter, Truly thou art of them: for thou art a Galilean, and thy speech is like.</verse>
  <verse number="71">And he began to anathematize and swear, That I know not this man of whom ye speak.</verse>
  <verse number="72">And of the second time the cock uttered a sound. And Peter remembered the word which Jesus spake to him, That before the cock utter a sound twice, thou shalt deny me thrice. And throwing blame, he wept.</verse>
