<div class="chapter" data-book="Micah" data-chapter="3" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And I said, Hear, I pray you, ye heads of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel: is it not for you to know judgment?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">who also eat the flesh of my people; and they flay their skin from off them, and break their bones: yea, they chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not answer them: yea, he will hide his face from them at that time, according as they have wrought evil in their doings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people to err; that bite with their teeth and cry, Peace; and whoso putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Therefore it shall be night unto you, that ye shall have no vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be black over them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the seers shall be ashamed, and the diviners confounded; yea, they shall all cover their lips: for there is no answer of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But I truly am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and rulers of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD in the midst of us? no evil shall come upon us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.</p>
