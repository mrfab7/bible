<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Zophar the Naamathite answereth and saith:—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Is a multitude of words not answered? And is a man of lips justified?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thy devices make men keep silent, Thou scornest, and none is causing blushing!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And thou sayest, ‘Pure is my discourse, And clean I have been in Thine eyes.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And yet, O that God had spoken! And doth open His lips with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And declare to thee secrets of wisdom, For counsel hath foldings. And know thou that God forgetteth for thee, Some of thine iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">By searching dost thou find out God? Unto perfection find out the Mighty One?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Heights of the heavens!—what dost thou? Deeper than Sheol!—what knowest thou?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Longer than earth is its measure, And broader than the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If He pass on, and shut up, and assemble, Who then dost reverse it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For he hath known men of vanity, And He seeth iniquity, And one doth not consider it!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And empty man is bold, And the colt of a wild ass man is born.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If thou—thou hast prepared thy heart, And hast spread out unto Him thy hands,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If iniquity is in thy hand, put it far off, And let not perverseness dwell in thy tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For then thou liftest up thy face from blemish, And thou hast been firm, and fearest not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For thou dost forget misery, As waters passed away thou rememberest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And above the noon doth age rise, Thou fliest—as the morning thou art.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And thou hast trusted because their is hope, And searched—in confidence thou liest down,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And thou hast rested, And none is causing trembling, And many have entreated thy face;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the eyes of the wicked are consumed, And refuge hath perished from them, And their hope is a breathing out of soul!</p>
