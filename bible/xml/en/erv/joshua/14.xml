  <verse number="1">And these are the inheritances which the children of Israel took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers’ houses of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed unto them,</verse>
  <verse number="2">by the lot of their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half tribe beyond Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: and they gave no portion unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for their cattle and for their substance.</verse>
  <verse number="5">As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then the children of Judah drew nigh unto Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the LORD spake unto Moses the man of God concerning me and concerning thee in Kadesh-barnea.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in mine heart.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy foot hath trodden shall be an inheritance to thee and to thy children for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the LORD my God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he spake, these forty and five years, from the time that the LORD spake this word unto Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five years old.</verse>
  <verse number="11">As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war and to go out and to come in.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakim were there, and cities great and fenced: it may be that the LORD will be with me, and I shall drive them out, as the LORD spake.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh for an inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, unto this day; because that he wholly followed the LORD, the God of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Now the name of Hebron beforetime was Kirjath-arba; which Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim. And the land had rest from war.</verse>
