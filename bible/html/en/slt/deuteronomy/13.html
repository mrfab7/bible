<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When there shall arise in the midst of you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and he gave to thee a sign or a wonder,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the sign or the wonder come which he spake to thee, saying, We will go after other gods which we know not, and we will serve them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thou shalt not hear to the words of that prophet or to that dreamer of dreams: for Jehovah thy God tries you to know whether ye are loving Jehovah your God with all your heart and with all your soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Ye shall go after Jehovah your God, and ye shall fear him, and his commands shall ye watch, and to his voice shall ye hear, and ye shall serve him, and to him shall ye cleave.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall die, for he spake a turning away from Jehovah your God, having brought you out of the land of Egypt and redeemed thee from the house of servants, to thrust thee away from the way which Jehovah thy God commanded to go in it: and put thou away the evil from the midst of thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When thy brother, the son of thy mother, shall entice thee, or thy son, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend who is as thy soul, in secret, saying, We will go and serve other gods which thou knewest not, thou, and thy fathers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">From the gods of the people which are round about you, coming near to thee, or being far off from thee, from the end of the earth even to the end of the earth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Thou shalt not be willing to him, and thou shalt not hear to him, and thine eye shall not have compassion upon him, and thou shalt not pity, and thou shalt not cover over him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But killing, thou shalt kill him; thy hand shall be upon him for the first to put him to death, and the hand of all the people at last.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And stone him with stones and he died, for he sought to thrust thee away from Jehovah thy God, having brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And all Israel shall hear, and shall fear, and they shall not add to do this evil in the midst of thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When thou shalt hear in one of thy cities which Jehovah thy God gave to thee to dwell there, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Men, sons of Belial went forth from the midst of thee, and they will thrust away the inhabitants of their city, saying, We will go and serve other gods which ye knew not;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And seek, and examine, and ask, doing well; and behold, the truth and the word certain this abomination being done in the midst of you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Smiting, thou shalt smite the inhabitants of that city with the mouth of the sword, exterminating it, and all that is in it, and its cattle, with the mouth of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And thou shalt gather all its spoil to the midst of its street, and burn in fire the city and all its spoil, wholly, to Jehovah thy God: and it was a heap forever; it shall no more be built.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And there shall not cleave upon their hand any thing from that devoted to destruction: so that Jehovah shall turn back from the burning of his anger and give to thee mercy, and compassionate thee, as he sware to thy fathers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">When thou shalt hear to the voice of Jehovah thy God to watch all his commands which I command thee this day, to do the right in the eyes of Jehovah thy God.</p>
