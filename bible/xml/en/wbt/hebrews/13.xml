  <verse number="1">Let brotherly love continue.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for by this some have entertained angels unawares.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them who suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled: but lewd persons and adulterers God will judge.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Let your manner of life be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</verse>
  <verse number="6">So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do to me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Remember them who have the rule over you, who have spoken to you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their manner of life.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to-day, and for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines: for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied in them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">We have an altar, of which they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Let us go forth therefore to him without the camp, bearing his reproach.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For here we have no continuing city, but we seek one to come.</verse>
  <verse number="15">By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But to do good, and to communicate, forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,</verse>
  <verse number="21">Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter to you in few words.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Know ye, that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Grace be with you all. Amen.</verse>
