<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the sabbath having intervened, Mary Magdalene, and Mary of James, and Salome, bought spices, that having come, they might anoint him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And very early in the morning of one of the sabbaths, they came to the tomb, the sun having risen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they said to themselves, Who shall roll away for us the stone from the door of the tomb?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And having looked up, they saw that the stone was rolled away: for it was very great.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And having come to the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, being encompassed with a white robe; and they were terrified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he says to them, Be not terrified: Ye seek Jesus the Nazarene, being crucified: he was raised; he is not here: see the place where they laid him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But retire ye; say to his disciples and to Peter that he goes before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And having come forth quickly, they fled from the tomb; and terror and amazement held them: and they said nothing to any; for they were afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And having risen early the first of the sabbath, he was manifested first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast seven demons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">She having gone announced to them having been with him, grieving and weeping.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And they having heard that he lives, and was seen by her, believed not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And after these things, to two of them, walking about, was he manifested in another form, they going into the field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And they having come announced to the rest: neither did they believe them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Afterwards to those reclining at table was he manifested, and he reproached their unbelief and hard heart, because they believed not them having seen him raised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he said to them, Having gone into all the world proclaim the good news to all creation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he having believed and having been immersed shall be saved; but he not having believed shall be condemned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And these signs shall follow those having believed; In my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">They shall take up serpents; and should they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall put hands upon the sick, and they shall be well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Truly therefore the Lord, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into the heavens, and sat on the right hand of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And they, having gone forth, proclaimed every where, the Lord performing together, and confirming the word by signs following. Amen.</p>
