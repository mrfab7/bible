<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool’s vexation is heavier than them both.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Fury is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before jealousy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Open rebuke is better than hidden love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are profuse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The full soul trampleth on a honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart; and the sweetness of one’s friend is [the fruit] of hearty counsel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not; and go not into thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity: better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad, that I may have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A prudent [man] seeth the evil, [and] hideth himself; the simple pass on, [and] are punished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Take his garment that is become surety [for] another, and hold him in pledge for a strange woman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be reckoned a curse to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">A continual dropping on a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">whosoever will restrain her restraineth the wind, and his right hand encountereth oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Iron is sharpened by iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Whoso keepeth the fig-tree shall eat the fruit thereof; and he that guardeth his master shall be honoured.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">As [in] water face [answereth] to face, so the heart of man to man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Sheol and destruction are insatiable; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The fining-pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold; so let a man be to the mouth that praiseth him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">If thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his folly depart from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Be well acquainted with the appearance of thy flocks; look well to thy herds:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">for wealth is not for ever; and doth the crown [endure] from generation to generation?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The hay is removed, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered in.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of a field;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">and there is goats’ milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and sustenance for thy maidens.</p>
