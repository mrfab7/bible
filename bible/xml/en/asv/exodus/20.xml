  <verse number="1">And God spake all these words, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">I am Jehovah thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, nor any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:</verse>
  <verse number="5">thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them; for I Jehovah thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generation of them that hate me,</verse>
  <verse number="6">and showing lovingkindness unto thousands of them that love me and keep my commandments.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain; for Jehovah will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work;</verse>
  <verse number="10">but the seventh day is a sabbath unto Jehovah thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:</verse>
  <verse number="11">for in six days Jehovah made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore Jehovah blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which Jehovah thy God giveth thee.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Thou shalt not kill.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thou shalt not commit adultery.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thou shalt not steal.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s wife, nor his man-servant, nor his maid-servant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is thy neighbor’s.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And all the people perceived the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the voice of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they trembled, and stood afar off.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us, lest we die.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before you, that ye sin not.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Jehovah said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye yourselves have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Ye shall not make other gods with me; gods of silver, or gods of gold, ye shall not make unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="24">An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt-offerings, and thy peace-offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in every place where I record my name I will come unto thee and I will bless thee.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And if thou make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stones; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not uncovered thereon.</verse>
