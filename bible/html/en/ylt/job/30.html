<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And now, laughed at me, Have the younger in days than I, Whose fathers I have loathed to set With the dogs of my flock.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Also—the power of their hands, why is it to me? On them hath old age perished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">With want and with famine gloomy, Those fleeing to a dry place, Formerly a desolation and waste,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Those cropping mallows near a shrub, And broom-roots is their food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">From the midst they are cast out, (They shout against them as a thief),</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In a frightful place of valleys to dwell, Holes of earth and clefts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Among shrubs they do groan, Under nettles they are gathered together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Sons of folly—even sons without name, They have been smitten from the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And now, their song I have been, And I am to them for a byword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They have abominated me, They have kept far from me, And from before me have not spared to spit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Because His cord He loosed and afflicteth me, And the bridle from before me, They have cast away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">On the right hand doth a brood arise, My feet they have cast away, And they raise up against me, Their paths of calamity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They have broken down my path, By my calamity they profit, ‘He hath no helper.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">As a wide breach they come, Under the desolation have rolled themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He hath turned against me terrors, It pursueth as the wind mine abundance, And as a thick cloud, Hath my safety passed away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And now, in me my soul poureth itself out, Seize me do days of affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">At night my bone hath been pierced in me, And mine eyelids do not lie down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">By the abundance of power, Is my clothing changed, As the mouth of my coat it doth gird me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Casting me into mire, And I am become like dust and ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I cry unto Thee, And Thou dost not answer me, I have stood, and Thou dost consider me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Thou art turned to be fierce to me, With the strength of Thy hand, Thou oppressest me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Thou dost lift me up, On the wind Thou dost cause me to ride, And Thou meltest—Thou levellest me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For I have known To death Thou dost bring me back, And to the house appointed for all living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Surely not against the heap Doth He send forth the hand, Though in its ruin they have safety.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Did not I weep for him whose day is hard? Grieved hath my soul for the needy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">When good I expected, then cometh evil, And I wait for light, and darkness cometh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">My bowels have boiled, and have not ceased, Gone before me have days of affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Mourning I have gone without the sun, I have risen, in an assembly I cry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">A brother I have been to dragons, And a companion to daughters of the ostrich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">My skin hath been black upon me, And my bone hath burned from heat,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And my harp doth become mourning, And my organ the sound of weeping.</p>
