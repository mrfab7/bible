<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="31" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“I have made a covenant with my eyes. How then could I gaze with desire at a virgin?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For what is the allotment of God from above, or the heritage from the Almighty on high?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Does not disaster come to the unjust and calamity to the workers of iniquity?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Does He not see my ways and count my every step?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If I have walked in falsehood or my foot has rushed to deceit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">let God weigh me with honest scales, that He may know my integrity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If my steps have turned from the path, if my heart has followed my eyes, or if impurity has stuck to my hands,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">then may another eat what I have sown, and may my crops be uprooted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">If my heart has been enticed by my neighbor’s wife, or I have lurked at his door,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">then may my own wife grind grain for another, and may other men sleep with her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For that would be a heinous crime, an iniquity to be judged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For it is a fire that burns down to Abaddon; it would root out my entire harvest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or maidservant when they made a complaint against me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">what will I do when God rises to judge? How will I answer when called to account?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Did not He who made me in the womb also make them? Did not the same One form us in the womb?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If I have denied the desires of the poor or allowed the widow’s eyes to fail,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">if I have eaten my morsel alone, not sharing it with the fatherless—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">though from my youth I reared him as would a father, and from my mother’s womb I guided the widow—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">if I have seen one perish for lack of clothing, or a needy man without a cloak,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">if his heart has not blessed me for warming him with the fleece of my sheep,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless because I saw that I had support in the gate,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">then may my arm fall from my shoulder and be torn from its socket.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For calamity from God terrifies me, and His splendor I cannot overpower.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">If I have put my trust in gold or called pure gold my security,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">if I have rejoiced in my great wealth because my hand had gained so much,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">if I have beheld the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">this would also be an iniquity to be judged, for I would have denied God on high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">If I have rejoiced in my enemy’s ruin, or exulted when evil befell him—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking for his life with a curse—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">if the men of my house have not said, ‘Who is there who has not had his fill?’—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">but no stranger had to lodge on the street, for my door has been open to the traveler—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">if I have covered my transgressions like Adam by hiding my guilt in my heart,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">because I greatly feared the crowds and the contempt of the clans terrified me, so that I kept silent and would not go outside—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">(Oh, that I had one to hear me! Here is my signature. Let the Almighty answer me; let my accuser compose an indictment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Surely I would carry it on my shoulder and wear it like a crown.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">I would give account of all my steps; I would approach Him like a prince.)—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">if my land cries out against me and its furrows weep together,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">if I have devoured its produce without payment or broken the spirit of its tenants,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">then let briers grow instead of wheat and stinkweed instead of barley.” Thus conclude the words of Job.</p>
