<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="5" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">For we know that if our earthly house of the tent were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For also in this we groan, longing to have our dwelling from heaven put on:</verse>
  <verse number="3">If also being even clothed we shall not be found naked.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For also being in the tent we groan, being loaded: since we wish not to be unclothed, but to be clothed, that the mortal should be swallowed up of life.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he having brought us about to this same, God, he having also given us the pledge of the Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Therefore being always confident, and knowing that, being at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</verse>
  <verse number="7">(For we walk by faith, and not by external appearance:)</verse>
  <verse number="8">And we are confident, and are contented rather to be absent from the body, and to be at home in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Wherefore also let us seek the honour, whether being at home, whether being absent, to be pleasing to him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For we must all be made manifest before the judgment seat of Christ; that each might receive the things for the body, for what he did, good or bad.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men; and we are made manifest to God; and I hope also to have been made manifest to your consciences.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For not again do we recommend ourselves to you, but giving you occasion for boasting over us, that ye might have for them boasting in face, and not in heart.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For whether we be beside ourselves, to God: or be of sound mind, to you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For the love of Christ holds us together; having judged this, that if one died for all, then all dead:</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he died for all, that the living no more live to themselves, but to him having died for them, and having risen.</verse>
  <verse number="16">So that we from now know none according to the flesh: and if also we have known Christ according to the flesh, but now we know no more.</verse>
  <verse number="17">So that if any in Christ, a new creation: old things have passed away; behold, all have become new.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And all things of God, having reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and given us the service of reconciliation;</verse>
  <verse number="19">For as God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not reckoning to them their faults; and having set in us the word of reconciliation.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For Christ therefore are we ambassadors, as of God beseeching by us: we pray for the sake of Christ, be ye reconciled to God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For him not knowing sin, he made sin for us; that we might be the justice of God in him.</verse>
