  <verse number="1">Brethren, even if a man be overtaken in any trespass, ye which are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of meekness; looking to thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Bear ye one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For if a man thinketh himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But let each man prove his own work, and then shall he have his glorying in regard of himself alone, and not of his neighbour.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For each man shall bear his own burden.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</verse>
  <verse number="10">So then, as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward them that are of the household of the faith.</verse>
  <verse number="11">See with how large letters I have written unto you with mine own hand.</verse>
  <verse number="12">As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For not even they who receive circumcision do themselves keep the law; but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But far be it from me to glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world hath been crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.</verse>
