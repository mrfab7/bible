  <verse number="1">Then Job answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Shall vain words have an end? or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?</verse>
  <verse number="4">I also could speak as ye do; if your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could join words together against you, and shake mine head at you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the solace of my lips should assuage your grief.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?</verse>
  <verse number="7">But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And thou hast laid fast hold on me, which is a witness against me: and my leanness riseth up against me, it testifieth to my face.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He hath torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me; he hath gnashed upon me with his teeth: mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully: they gather themselves together against me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">God delivereth me to the ungodly, and casteth me into the hands of the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I was at ease, and he brake me asunder; yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces: he hath also set me up for his mark.</verse>
  <verse number="13">His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He breaketh me with breach upon breach; he runneth upon me like a giant.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and have laid my horn in the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="16">My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;</verse>
  <verse number="17">Although there is no violence in mine hands, and my prayer is pure.</verse>
  <verse number="18">O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no resting place.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and he that coucheth for me is on high.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God;</verse>
  <verse number="21">That he would maintain the right of a man with God, and of a son of man with his neighbour!</verse>
  <verse number="22">For when a few years are come, I shall go the way whence I shall not return.</verse>
