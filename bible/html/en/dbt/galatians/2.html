<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then after a lapse of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with [me];</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and I went up according to revelation, and I laid before them the glad tidings which I preach among the nations, but privately to those conspicuous [among them], lest in any way I run or had run in vain;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">(but neither was Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, compelled to be circumcised;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and [it was] on account of the false brethren brought in surreptitiously, who came in surreptitiously to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">to whom we yielded in subjection not even for an hour, that the truth of the glad tidings might remain with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But from those who were conspicuous as being somewhat—whatsoever they were, it makes no difference to me: God does not accept man’s person; for to me those who were conspicuous communicated nothing;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">but, on the contrary, seeing that the glad tidings of the uncircumcision were confided to me, even as to Peter that of the circumcision,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">(for he that wrought in Peter for [the] apostleship of the circumcision wrought also in me towards the Gentiles,)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and recognising the grace given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were conspicuous as being pillars, gave to me and Barnabas [the] right hands of fellowship, that we [should go] to the nations, and they to the circumcision;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">only that we should remember the poor, which same thing also I was diligent to do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But when Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to [the] face, because he was to be condemned:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">for before that certain came from James, he ate with [those of] the nations; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those of [the] circumcision;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and the rest of the Jews also played the same dissembling part with him; so that even Barnabas was carried away too by their dissimulation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But when I saw that they do not walk straightforwardly, according to the truth of the glad tidings, I said to Peter before all, If thou, being a Jew, livest as the nations and not as the Jews, how dost thou compel the nations to Judaize?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">We, Jews by nature, and not sinners of [the] nations,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">but knowing that a man is not justified on the principle of works of law [nor] but by the faith of Jesus Christ, we also have believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified on the principle of [the] faith of Christ; and not of works of law; because on the principle of works of law no flesh shall be justified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Now if in seeking to be justified in Christ we also have been found sinners, then [is] Christ minister of sin? Far be the thought.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For if the things I have thrown down, these I build again, I constitute myself a transgressor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For I, through law, have died to law, that I may live to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I am crucified with Christ, and no longer live, I, but Christ lives in me; but [in] that I now live in flesh, I live by faith, the [faith] of the Son of God, who has loved me and given himself for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">I do not set aside the grace of God; for if righteousness [is] by law, then Christ has died for nothing.</p>
