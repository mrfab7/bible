<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you might seem to have failed [of it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For indeed we have had glad tidings presented to us, even as they also; but the word of the report did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For we enter into the rest who have believed; as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest; although the works had been completed from [the] foundation of [the] world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For he has said somewhere of the seventh [day] thus, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and in this again, If they shall enter into my rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Seeing therefore it remains that some enter into it, and those who first received the glad tidings did not enter in on account of not hearkening to the word,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">again he determines a certain day, saying, in David, ‘To-day,’ after so long a time; (according as it has been said before), To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For if Jesus had brought them into rest, he would not have spoken afterwards about another day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">There remains then a sabbatism to the people of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For he that has entered into his rest, he also has rested from his works, as God did from his own.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Let us therefore use diligence to enter into that rest, that no one may fall after the same example of not hearkening to the word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For the word of God [is] living and operative, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and penetrating to [the] division of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and a discerner of the thoughts and intents of [the] heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And there is not a creature unapparent before him; but all things [are] naked and laid bare to his eyes, with whom we have to do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Having therefore a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For we have not a high priest not able to sympathise with our infirmities, but tempted in all things in like manner, sin apart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let us approach therefore with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for seasonable help.</p>
