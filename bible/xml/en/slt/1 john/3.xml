<chapter book="1 John" number="3" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">See ye, what kind of love the Father has given us, that we should be called the children of God: for this the world knows us not, for it knew him not.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Dearly beloved, now are we the children of God, and it has not yet been manifested what we shall be: and we know that, if he be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And every one having this hope in him purifies himself, as he himself is pure.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Every one doing sin also does lawlessness; for sin is lawlessness.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And ye know that he was manifested that he might let go our sins; and in him is no sin.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Every one remaining in him sins not: every one sinning has not seen him, nor known him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Little children, let none deceive you: he doing justice is just, as he is just.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He doing sin is of the accuser; for the accuser sins from the beginning. For this was the Son of God manifested, that he might loose the works of the accuser.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Every one born of God does not sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, for he has been born of God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the accuser: every one not doing justice is not of God, and he not loving his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And for what slew he him? Because his works were evil, and those of his brother just.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Be not amazed, my brethren, if the world hate you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">We know that we have passed from death to life, for we love the brethren. He not loving the brother remains in death.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Every one hating his brother is a manslayer: and ye know that no manslayer has eternal life remaining in him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">In this have we known love, for he set his soul for us: and we ought to set the souls for the brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And whoever has the life of the world, and sees his brother having need, and should shut up his bowels from him, how remains the love of God in him?</verse>
  <verse number="18">My little children, we should not love in word, neither in tongue; but in work and truth.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And in this we know that we are of the truth, and we will yield our hearts before him.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For if our heart condemn us, for God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Dearly beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have freedom of speech towards God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And whatever we ask, we receive of him, for we keep his commands, and do things pleasing before him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And this is his command, That we believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us command.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And he keeping his commands remains in him, and he in him. And in this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit he gave us.</verse>
