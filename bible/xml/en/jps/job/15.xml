  <verse number="1">Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Should a wise man make answer with windy knowledge, And fill his belly with the east wind?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Should he reason with unprofitable talk, Or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Yea, thou doest away with fear, And impairest devotion before God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth, And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; Yea, thine own lips testify against thee.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Art thou the first man that was born? Or wast thou brought forth before the hills?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Dost thou hearken in the council of God? And dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?</verse>
  <verse number="9">What knowest thou, that we know not? What understandest thou, which is not in us?</verse>
  <verse number="10">With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, Much older than thy father.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Are the consolations of God too small for thee, And the word that dealeth gently with thee?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Why doth thy heart carry thee away? And why do thine eyes wink?</verse>
  <verse number="13">That thou turnest thy spirit against God, And lettest such words go out of thy mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="14">What is man, that he should be clean? And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Behold, He putteth no trust in His holy ones; Yea, the heavens are not clean in His sight.</verse>
  <verse number="16">How much less one that is abominable and impure, Man who drinketh iniquity like water!</verse>
  <verse number="17">I will tell thee, hear thou me; And that which I have seen I will declare—</verse>
  <verse number="18">Which wise men have told From their fathers, and have not hid it;</verse>
  <verse number="19">Unto whom alone the land was given, And no stranger passed among them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, Even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.</verse>
  <verse number="21">A sound of terrors is in his ears: In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, And he is waited for of the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He wandereth abroad for bread: ‘Where is it?’ He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Distress and anguish overwhelm him; They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Because he hath stretched out his hand against God, And behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty;</verse>
  <verse number="26">He runneth upon him with a stiff neck, With the thick bosses of his bucklers.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Because he hath covered his face with his fatness, And made collops of fat on his loins;</verse>
  <verse number="28">And he hath dwelt in desolate cities, In houses which no man would inhabit, Which were ready to become heaps.</verse>
  <verse number="29">He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, Neither shall their produce bend to the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="30">He shall not depart out of darkness; The flame shall dry up his branches, And by the breath of His mouth shall he go away.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself; For vanity shall be his recompense.</verse>
  <verse number="32">It shall be accomplished before his time, And his branch shall not be leafy.</verse>
  <verse number="33">He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, And shall cast off his flower as the olive.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For the company of the godless shall be desolate, And fire shall consume the tents of bribery.</verse>
  <verse number="35">They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, And their belly prepareth deceit.</verse>
