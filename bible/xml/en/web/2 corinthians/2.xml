<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="2" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But I determined this for myself, that I would not come to you again in sorrow.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For if I make you sorry, then who will make me glad but he who is made sorry by me?</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I wrote this very thing to you, so that, when I came, I wouldn’t have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy would be shared by all of you.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not that you should be made sorry, but that you might know the love that I have so abundantly for you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But if any has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I not press too heavily) to you all.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many;</verse>
  <verse number="7">so that on the contrary you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his excessive sorrow.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Therefore I beg you to confirm your love toward him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For to this end I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Now I also forgive whomever you forgive anything. For if indeed I have forgiven anything, I have forgiven that one for your sakes in the presence of Christ,</verse>
  <verse number="11">that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his schemes.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now when I came to Troas for the Good News of Christ, and when a door was opened to me in the Lord,</verse>
  <verse number="13">I had no relief for my spirit, because I didn’t find Titus, my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went out into Macedonia.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet aroma of his knowledge in every place.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in those who are saved, and in those who perish;</verse>
  <verse number="16">to the one a stench from death to death; to the other a sweet aroma from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?</verse>
  <verse number="17">For we are not as so many, peddling the word of God. But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.</verse>
