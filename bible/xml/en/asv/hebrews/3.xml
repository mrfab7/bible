<chapter book="Hebrews" number="3" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, even Jesus;</verse>
  <verse number="2">who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For he hath been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he that built the house hath more honor than the house.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken;</verse>
  <verse number="6">but Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Wherefore, even as the Holy Spirit saith, To-day if ye shall hear his voice,</verse>
  <verse number="8">Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,</verse>
  <verse number="9">Where your fathers tried me by proving me, And saw my works forty years.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Wherefore I was displeased with this generation, And said, They do always err in their heart: But they did not know my ways;</verse>
  <verse number="11">As I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Take heed, brethren, lest haply there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God:</verse>
  <verse number="13">but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called To-day; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin:</verse>
  <verse number="14">for we are become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end:</verse>
  <verse number="15">while it is said, To-day if ye shall hear his voice, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For who, when they heard, did provoke? nay, did not all they that came out of Egypt by Moses?</verse>
  <verse number="17">And with whom was he displeased forty years? was it not with them that sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that were disobedient?</verse>
  <verse number="19">And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.</verse>
