  <verse number="3">When the battle intensified against Saul, the archers overtook him and wounded him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, “Draw your sword and run me through with it, or these uncircumcised men will come and torture me!” But his armor-bearer was terrified and refused to do it. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he too fell on his own sword and died.</verse>
  <verse number="6">So Saul died together with his three sons and all his house.</verse>
  <verse number="7">When all the Israelites in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons had died, they abandoned their cities and ran away. So the Philistines came and occupied their cities.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.</verse>

  <verse number="13">So Saul died for his unfaithfulness to the LORD, because he did not keep the word of the LORD and even consulted a medium for guidance,</verse>
  <verse number="14">and he failed to inquire of the LORD. So the LORD put him to death and turned the kingdom over to David son of Jesse.</verse>
