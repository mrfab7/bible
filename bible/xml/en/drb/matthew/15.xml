  <verse number="1">THEN came to him from Jerusalem scribes and Pharisees, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Why do thy disciples trangress the tradition of the ancients? For they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But he answering, said to them: Why do you also transgress the commandment of God for your tradition? For God said:</verse>
  <verse number="4">Honour thy father and mother: And: He that shall curse father or mother, let him die the death.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But you say: Whosoever shall say to father or mother, The gift whatsoever proceedeth from me, shall profit thee.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he shall not honour his father or his mother: and you have made void the commandment of God for your tradition.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Hypocrites, well hath Isaias prophesied of you, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="8">This people honoureth me with their lips: but their heart is far from me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and commandments of men.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And having called together the multitudes unto him, he said to them: Hear ye and understand.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man: but what cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Then came his disciples, and said to him: Dost thou know that the Pharisees, when they heard this word, were scandalized?</verse>
  <verse number="13">But he answering them, said: Every plant which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Let them alone: they are blind, and leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the pit.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Peter answering, said to him: Expound to us this parable.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But he said: Are you also yet without understanding?</verse>
  <verse number="17">Do you not understand, that whatsoever entereth into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the privy?</verse>
  <verse number="18">But the things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart, and those things defile a man.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For from the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.</verse>
  <verse number="20">These are the things that defile a man. But to eat with unwashed hands doth not defile a man.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Jesus went from thence, and retired into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And behold a woman of Canaan who came out of those coasts, crying out, said to him: Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David: my daughter is grieviously troubled by the devil.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Who answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying: Send her away, for she crieth after us:</verse>
  <verse number="24">And he answering, said: I was not sent but to the sheep that are lost of the house of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But she came and adored him, saying: Lord, help me.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Who answering, said: It is not good to take the bread of the children, and to cast it to the dogs.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But she said: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat of the crumbs that fall from the table of their masters.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then Jesus answering, said to her: O woman, great is thy faith: be it done to thee as thou wilt: and her daughter was cured from that hour.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And when Jesus had passed away from thence, he came nigh the sea of Galilee. And going up into a mountain, he sat there.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And there came to him great multitudes, having with them the dumb, the blind, the lame, the maimed, and many others: and they cast them down at his feet, and he healed them:</verse>
  <verse number="31">So that the multitudes marvelled seeing the dumb speak, the lame walk, and the blind see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And Jesus called together his disciples, and said: I have compassion on the multitudes, because they continue with me now three days, and have not what to eat, and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And the disciples say unto him: Whence then should we have so many loaves in the desert, as to fill so great a multitude?</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Jesus said to them: How many loaves have you? But they said: Seven, and a few little fishes.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And he commanded the multitude to sit down upon the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And taking the seven loaves and the fishes, and giving thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the people.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And they did all eat, and had their fill. And they took up seven baskets full, of what remained of the fragments.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And they that did eat, were four thousand men, beside children and women.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And having dismissed the multitude, he went up into a boat, and came into the coasts of Magedan.</verse>
