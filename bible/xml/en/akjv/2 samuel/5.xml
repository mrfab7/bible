<chapter book="2 Samuel" number="5" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, you were he that led out and brought in Israel: and the LORD said to you, You shall feed my people Israel, and you shall be a captain over Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="3">So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="4">David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.</verse>
  <verse number="5">In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the king and his men went to Jerusalem to the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: which spoke to David, saying, Except you take away the blind and the lame, you shall not come in here: thinking, David cannot come in here.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And David said on that day, Whoever gets up to the gutter, and smites the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind that are hated of David’s soul, he shall be chief and captain. Why they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</verse>
  <verse number="9">So David dwelled in the fort, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was with him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel’s sake.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And these be the names of those that were born to him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</verse>
  <verse number="15">Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard of it, and went down to the hold.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And David inquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? will you deliver them into my hand? And the LORD said to David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into your hand.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and said, The LORD has broken forth on my enemies before me, as the breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baalperazim.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And there they left their images, and David and his men burned them.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And when David inquired of the LORD, he said, You shall not go up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come on them over against the mulberry trees.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And let it be, when you hear the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall bestir yourself: for then shall the LORD go out before you, to smite the host of the Philistines.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until you come to Gazer.</verse>
