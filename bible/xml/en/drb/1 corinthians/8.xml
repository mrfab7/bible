<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="8" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">NOW concerning those things that are sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up; but charity edifieth.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he hath not yet known as he ought to know.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But if any any love God, the same is known by him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For although there be that are called gods, either in heaven or on earth (for there be gods many, and lords many);</verse>
  <verse number="6">Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But there is not knowledge in every one. For some until this present, with conscience of the idol: eat as a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But meat doth not commend us to God. For neither, if we eat, shall we have the more; nor, if we eat not, shall we have the less.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But take heed lest perhaps this your liberty become a stumblingblock to the weak.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For if a man see him that hath knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s temple, shall not his conscience, being weak, be emboldened to eat those things which are sacrificed to idols ?</verse>
  <verse number="11">And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ hath died ?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now when you sin thus against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Wherefore, if meat scandalize my brother, I will never eat flesh, lest I should scandalize my brother.</verse>
