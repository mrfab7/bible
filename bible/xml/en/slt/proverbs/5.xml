<chapter book="Proverbs" number="5" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My son, attend to my wisdom; incline thine ear to understanding:</verse>
  <verse number="2">To watch meditation, and thy lips shall guard knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the lips of the strange woman will drop droppings of the honeycomb, and her palate is smooth above oil:</verse>
  <verse number="4">And her latter state being bitter as wormwood; sharp as a two-mouthed sword.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps will hold fast to hades.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Lest thou shalt make level the path of life, her tracks wavered; thou wilt not know.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And now, ye sons, hear to me, and ye shall not depart from the words of my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Remove far off from her thy way, and thou shalt not draw near to the door of her house:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Lest thou shalt give thy strength to others, and thy years to the cruel:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Lest strangers shall be filled with thy strength, and thy labors in the house of strangers;</verse>
  <verse number="11">And thou didst lament in thy latter state, in the consuming of thy flesh and thy fulness,</verse>
  <verse number="12">And thou saidst, How did I hate instruction, and my heart despise reproofs.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And I heard not to the voice of him teaching me, and I inclined not mine ear to him instructing me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">As I was almost in all evil in the midst of the convocation and the assembly.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Drink water from thy pit, and flowing from the midst of thy well.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Thy fountains shall be dispersed without; in the broad places streams of waters.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They shall be to thee alone, and not strangers with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Thy fountain shall be blessed: and rejoice from the wife of thy youth.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The hind of loves and the wild goat of grace; her breasts shall satiate thee in all time; thou shalt always wander in her loves.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And wherefore, my son, wilt thou wander with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</verse>
  <verse number="21">For before the eyes of Jehovah are the ways of man, and he makes level all his tracks.</verse>
  <verse number="22">His iniquities shall take the unjust one, and with the cords of his sins shall he be held fast.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He shall die in not being instructed, and he shall wander in the multitude of his folly.</verse>
