  <verse number="1">And Jacob lifteth up his feet, and goeth towards the land of the sons of the east;</verse>
  <verse number="2">and he looketh, and lo, a well in the field, and lo, there three droves of a flock crouching by it, for from that well they water the droves, and the great stone is on the mouth of the well.</verse>
  <verse number="3">(When thither have all the droves been gathered, and they have rolled the stone from off the mouth of the well, and have watered the flock, then they have turned back the stone on the mouth of the well to its place.)</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Jacob saith to them, ‘My brethren, from whence are ye?’ and they say, ‘We are from Haran.’</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he saith to them, ‘Have ye known Laban, son of Nahor?’ and they say, ‘We have known.’</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he saith to them, ‘Hath he peace?’ and they say, ‘Peace; and lo, Rachel his daughter is coming with the flock.’</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he saith, ‘Lo, the day is still great, it is not time for the cattle to be gathered; water ye the flock, and go, delight yourselves.’</verse>
  <verse number="8">And they say, ‘We are not able, till that all the droves be gathered together, and they have rolled away the stone from the mouth of the well, and we have watered the flock.’</verse>
  <verse number="9">He is yet speaking with them, and Rachel hath come with the flock which her father hath, for she is shepherdess;</verse>
  <verse number="10">and it cometh to pass when Jacob hath seen Rachel, daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the flock of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob cometh nigh and rolleth the stone from off the mouth of the well, and watereth the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Jacob kisseth Rachel, and lifteth up his voice, and weepeth,</verse>
  <verse number="12">and Jacob declareth to Rachel that he is her father’s brother, and that he is Rebekah’s son, and she runneth and declareth to her father.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And it cometh to pass, when Laban heareth the report of Jacob his sister’s son, that he runneth to meet him, and embraceth him, and kisseth him, and bringeth him in unto his house; and he recounteth to Laban all these things,</verse>
  <verse number="14">and Laban saith to him, ‘Only my bone and my flesh art thou;’ and he dwelleth with him a month of days.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Laban saith to Jacob, ‘Is it because thou art my brother that thou hast served me for nought? declare to me what is thy hire.’</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Laban hath two daughters, the name of the elder is Leah, and the name of the younger Rachel,</verse>
  <verse number="17">and the eyes of Leah are tender, and Rachel hath been fair of form and fair of appearance.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Jacob loveth Rachel, and saith, ‘I serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter:’</verse>
  <verse number="19">and Laban saith, ‘It is better for me to give her to thee than to give her to another man; dwell with me;’</verse>
  <verse number="20">and Jacob serveth for Rachel seven years; and they are in his eyes as some days, because of his loving her.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Jacob saith unto Laban, ‘Give up my wife, for my days have been fulfilled, and I go in unto her;’</verse>
  <verse number="22">and Laban gathereth all the men of the place, and maketh a banquet.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And it cometh to pass in the evening, that he taketh Leah, his daughter, and bringeth her in unto him, and he goeth in unto her;</verse>
  <verse number="24">and Laban giveth to her Zilpah, his maid-servant, to Leah his daughter, a maid-servant.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And it cometh to pass in the morning, that lo, it is Leah; and he saith unto Laban, ‘What is this thou hast done to me? for Rachel have I not served with thee? and why hast thou deceived me?’</verse>
  <verse number="26">And Laban saith, ‘It is not done so in our place, to give the younger before the first-born;</verse>
  <verse number="27">fulfil the week of this one, and we give to thee also this one, for the service which thou dost serve with me yet seven other years.’</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Jacob doth so, and fulfilleth the week of this one, and he giveth to him Rachel his daughter, to him for a wife;</verse>
  <verse number="29">and Laban giveth to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his maid-servant, for a maid-servant to her.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And he goeth in also unto Rachel, and he also loveth Rachel more than Leah; and he serveth with him yet seven other years.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And Jehovah seeth that Leah is the hated one, and He openeth her womb, and Rachel is barren;</verse>
  <verse number="32">and Leah conceiveth, and beareth a son, and calleth his name Reuben, for she said, ‘Because Jehovah hath looked on mine affliction; because now doth my husband love me.’</verse>
  <verse number="33">And she conceiveth again, and beareth a son, and saith, ‘Because Jehovah hath heard that I am the hated one, He also giveth to me even this one;’ and she calleth his name Simeon.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And she conceiveth again, and beareth a son, and saith, ‘Now is the time, my husband is joined unto me, because I have born to him three sons,’ therefore hath one called his name Levi.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And she conceiveth again, and beareth a son, and saith this time, ‘I praise Jehovah;’ therefore hath she called his name Judah; and she ceaseth from bearing.</verse>
