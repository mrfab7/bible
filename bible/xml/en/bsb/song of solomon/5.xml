<chapter book="Song of Solomon" number="5" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">I have come to my garden, my sister, my bride; I have gathered my myrrh with my spice. I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends, and drink; drink freely, O beloved.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I sleep, but my heart is awake. A sound! My beloved is knocking: “Open to me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my flawless one. My head is drenched with dew, my hair with the dampness of the night.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">I have taken off my robe—must I put it back on? I have washed my feet—must I soil them again?</verse>
  <verse number="4">My beloved put his hand to the latch; my heart pounded for him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I rose up to open for my beloved. My hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with flowing myrrh on the handles of the bolt.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I opened for my beloved, but he had turned and gone. My heart sank at his departure. I sought him but did not find him. I called, but he did not answer.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I encountered the watchmen on their rounds of the city. They beat me and bruised me; they took away my cloak, those guardians of the walls.</verse>
  <verse number="8">O daughters of Jerusalem, I adjure you, if you find my beloved, tell him I am sick with love.</verse>
  <verse number="9">How is your beloved better than others, O most beautiful among women? How is your beloved better than another, that you charge us so?</verse>
  <verse number="10">My beloved is dazzling and ruddy, outstanding among ten thousand.</verse>
  <verse number="11">His head is purest gold; his hair is wavy and black as a raven.</verse>
  <verse number="12">His eyes are like doves beside the streams of water, bathed in milk and mounted like jewels.</verse>
  <verse number="13">His cheeks are like beds of spice, towers of perfume. His lips are like lilies, dripping with flowing myrrh.</verse>
  <verse number="14">His arms are rods of gold set with beryl. His body is polished ivory bedecked with sapphires.</verse>
  <verse number="15">His legs are pillars of marble set on bases of pure gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, as majestic as the cedars.</verse>
  <verse number="16">His mouth is most sweet; he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</verse>
