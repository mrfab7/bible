<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Remind them to be subordinate to beginnings and powers, to yield obedience to authority, to be prepared for every good work,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">To slander none, to be without fighting, equitable, showing all meekness to all men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For once we also were unwise disobedient, deceived, being slaves to eager desires and various pleasures, living in vexation and envy, hated, and hating one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And when the kindness and philanthropy of our Saviour God was made evident,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Not of works in justice which we did; but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and the renovation of the Holy Spirit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Which he poured out upon us richly by Jesus Christ our Saviour;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">That justified by his grace, we might be heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Faithful the word, and I wish for thee to be assured of these things, that they having believed God might turn their thoughts to excel in good works. These things are good and profitable to men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And foolish questions, and genealogies, and strifes, and conflicts pertaining to the law, avoid; for they are unprofitable and vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A man, a heretic after one and the second admonition, reject;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Knowing such to be turned back, and he sins, being self-condemned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When I shall send Artemas to thee, or Tychicus, be earnest to come to me at Nicopolis: for there have I chosen to pass the winter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Send forward zealously Zenas pertaining to the law, and Apollos, that nothing fail them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And let ours also learn to excel in good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All they with me greet thee. Greet them loving us in the faith. Grace with you all. Amen.</p>
