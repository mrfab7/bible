<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I Beseech therefore, first of all, supplications to be made, prayers, entreaties, thanks, for all men;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For kings, and all them being in eminence; that we may lead a gentle and quiet life, in all devotion and gravity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For this good and acceptable before our Saviour God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who wills all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For one God, and one mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Having given himself a ransom for all, a testimony in his own time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For which I was placed a herald, and the sent, (I speak truth in Christ, I lie not;) a teacher of the nations in faith and truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I will therefore men shall pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without anger and reasoning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And likewise the women in well arranged simplicity, with modesty and discretion, arrange themselves; not in tresses, or gold, or pearls, or expensive clothing;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But (what become women professing religious worship) with good works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Let the woman, in freedom from care, learn in all subjection.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And I trust not the woman to teach, neither to exercise authority over the man, but to be in freedom from care.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, was in the transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And she shall be saved through the bringing forth children, if they remain in faith and love and consecration with discretion.</p>
