  <verse number="1">And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the abyss, and a great chain in his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he seized the dragon, the old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he cast him into the abyss, and shut him up, and affixed a seal above him, that he should no more deceive the nations, until the thousand years be finished: and after these things he must be loosed a little time.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given them: and the souls of them beheaded with an axe for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God, and who worshipped not the wild beast, nor his image, and took not the stamp upon their foreheads, and upon their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the rest of the dead returned not again to life even till the thousand years be finished. This the first rising up.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Happy and holy he having a part in the first rising up: over these has the second death no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and they shall reign with him a thousand years.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And when the thousand years should be finished, Satan shall be loosed from his prison,</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he shall go forth to deceive the nations that in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together for war: whose number as the sand of the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they went up upon the breadth of the earth, and they surrounded the camp of the holy, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the devil deceiving them was cast into the lake of fire and sulphur, where are the wild beast and false prophet, and they shall be tortured day and night for ever and ever.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And I saw a great white throne, and him sitting upon it, from the face of whom the earth and the heaven fled; and there was found no place for them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is of life: and the dead were judged from the things written in the books, according to their works.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the sea gave the dead in it; and death and hades gave the dead in them: and they were judged each one according to their works.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And death and hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And if any was not found written in the book of life, he was cast into the lake of fire.</verse>
