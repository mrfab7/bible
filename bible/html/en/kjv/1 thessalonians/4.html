<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort [you] by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, [so] ye would abound more and more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For this is the will of God, [even] your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">That no [man] go beyond and defraud his brother in [any] matter: because that the Lord [is] the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and [that] ye may have lack of nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive [and] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Then we which are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Wherefore comfort one another with these words.</p>
