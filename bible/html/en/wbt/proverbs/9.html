<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wisdom hath built her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Whoever is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He that reproveth a scorner, getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Reprove not a scorner, lest he shall hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If thou art wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">To call passengers who go right on their ways:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Whoever is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.</p>
