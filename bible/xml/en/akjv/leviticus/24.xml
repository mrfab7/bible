  <verse number="1">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Command the children of Israel, that they bring to you pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Without the veil of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening to the morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for ever in your generations.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He shall order the lamps on the pure candlestick before the LORD continually.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And you shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And you shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure table before the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And you shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And it shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy to him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the Israelitish woman’s son blasphemed the name of the Lord, and cursed. And they brought him to Moses: (and his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be showed them.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="14">Bring forth him that has cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And you shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he that blasphemes the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemes the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he that kills any man shall surely be put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he that kills a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he has done, so shall it be done to him;</verse>
  <verse number="20">Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he has caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he that kills a beast, he shall restore it: and he that kills a man, he shall be put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="22">You shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, that they should bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
