<chapter book="Job" number="14" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Man, that is born of a woman, Is of few days, and full of trouble.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one, And bringest me into judgment with thee?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Seeing his days are determined, The number of his months is with thee, And thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;</verse>
  <verse number="6">Look away from him, that he may rest, Till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For there is hope of a tree, If it be cut down, that it will sprout again, And that the tender branch thereof will not cease.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, And the stock thereof die in the ground;</verse>
  <verse number="9">Yet through the scent of water it will bud, And put forth boughs like a plant.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But man dieth, and is laid low: Yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?</verse>
  <verse number="11">As the waters fail from the sea, And the river wasteth and drieth up;</verse>
  <verse number="12">So man lieth down and riseth not: Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, Nor be roused out of their sleep.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Oh that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol, That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, That thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!</verse>
  <verse number="14">If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my warfare would I wait, Till my release should come.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thou wouldest call, and I would answer thee: Thou wouldest have a desire to the work of thy hands.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But now thou numberest my steps: Dost thou not watch over my sin?</verse>
  <verse number="17">My transgression is sealed up in a bag, And thou fastenest up mine iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But the mountain falling cometh to nought; And the rock is removed out of its place;</verse>
  <verse number="19">The waters wear the stones; The overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth: So thou destroyest the hope of man.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth; Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.</verse>
  <verse number="21">His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not; And they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But his flesh upon him hath pain, And his soul within him mourneth.</verse>
