<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My oblation, my food for my offerings made by fire, of a sweet savor unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto Jehovah: he-lambs a year old without blemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt-offering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">It is a continual burnt-offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the drink-offering thereof shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou pour out a drink-offering of strong drink unto Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meal-offering of the morning, and as the drink-offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And on the sabbath day two he-lambs a year old without blemish, and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and the drink-offering thereof:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">this is the burnt-offering of every sabbath, besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drinkoffering thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt-offering unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, and one ram, seven he-lambs a year old without blemish;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for each bullock; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for the one ram;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and a tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering unto every lamb; for a burnt-offering of a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And their drink-offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bullock, and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb: this is the burnt-offering of every month throughout the months of the year.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And one he-goat for a sin-offering unto Jehovah; it shall be offered besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is Jehovahâ€™s passover.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And on the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">In the first day shall be a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">but ye shall offer an offering made by fire, a burnt-offering unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven he-lambs a year old; they shall be unto you without blemish;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil: three tenth parts shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth parts for the ram;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">a tenth part shalt thou offer for every lamb of the seven lambs;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">and one he-goat for a sin-offering, to make atonement for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Ye shall offer these besides the burnt-offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt-offering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">After this manner ye shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto Jehovah: it shall be offered besides the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And on the seventh day ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Also in the day of the first-fruits, when ye offer a new meal-offering unto Jehovah in your feast of weeks, ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">but ye shall offer a burnt-offering for a sweet savor unto Jehovah: two young bullocks, one ram, seven he-lambs a year old;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for each bullock, two tenth parts for the one ram,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">a tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">one he-goat, to make atonement for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Besides the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, ye shall offer them (they shall be unto you without blemish), and their drink-offerings.</p>
