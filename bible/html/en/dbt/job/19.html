<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How long will ye vex my soul, and crush me with words?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">These ten times have ye reproached me; ye are not ashamed to stupefy me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And be it [that] I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and prove against me my reproach,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Know now that +God hath overthrown me, and hath surrounded me with his net.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, I cry out of wrong, and I am not heard; I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He hath hedged up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He breaketh me down on every side, and I am gone; and my hope hath he torn up as a tree.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And he hath kindled his anger against me, and hath counted me unto him as one of his enemies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">His troops have come together and cast up their way against me, and have encamped round about my tent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are quite estranged from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">My kinsfolk have failed, and my known friends have forgotten me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The sojourners in my house and my maids count me as a stranger; I am an alien in their sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I called my servant, and he answered not; I entreated him with my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">My breath is strange to my wife, and my entreaties to the children of my [mother’s] womb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Even young children despise me; I rise up, and they speak against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">All my intimate friends abhor me, and they whom I loved are turned against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My bones cleave to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, ye my friends; for the hand of +God hath touched me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Oh would that my words were written! oh that they were inscribed in a book!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">That with an iron style and lead they were graven in the rock for ever!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And [as for] me, I know that my Redeemer liveth, and the Last, he shall stand upon the earth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And [if] after my skin this shall be destroyed, yet from out of my flesh shall I see +God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another:—my reins are consumed within me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">If ye say, How shall we persecute him? when the root of the matter is found in me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Be ye yourselves afraid of the sword! for the sword is fury against misdeeds, that ye may know there is a judgment.</p>
