<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Samuel will say to Israel, Jehovah sent me to anoint thee for king over his people, over Israel: and now hear to the voice of the words of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thus said Jehovah of armies, I reviewed what Amalek did to Israel, how he set for him in the way in his going up out of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Now go and strike Amalek, and exterminate all which is to him, and thou shalt not spare to him; and kill from man even to woman, from child even to suckling, from ox and even to sheep, from camel and even to ass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Saul will cause the people to hear, and he will review them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Saul will come even to a city of Amalek, and he will lie in wait by the torrent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Saul will say to the Kenite, Go, remove, go down from the midst of the Amalekites, lest I shall add thee with him; for ye did mercy with all the sons of Israel in their coming up out of Egypt And the Kenite will remove from the midst of Amalek.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And Saul will strike Amalek from Havilah thy coming to Shur, which is upon the face of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he will seize Agag, king of Amalek, living, and be exterminated all the people with the mouth of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Saul and the people will have pity upon Agag, and upon the good of the sheep, and the oxen and the double, and upon the lambs and upon all the good, and they were not willing to exterminate them: and every work despised and wasting away, they exterminated it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the word of Jehovah will be to Samuel, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I lamented that I made Saul for king, for he turned back from after me, and my words he set not up. And it will kindle to Samuel, and he will cry to Jehovah all the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Samuel will rise early to meet Saul in the morning, and it will be announced to Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he sets up to him a hand, and he will turn round and pass over and go down to Gilgal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Samuel will come to Saul: and Saul will say to him, Blessed thou of Jehovah: I set up the word of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Samuel will say, And what the voice of sheep in mine ear, and the voice of the oxen which I hear?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Saul will say, From the Amalekites they brought them; which the people had pity upon the good of the sheep and of the oxen in order to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God; and the rest we exterminated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Samuel will say to Saul, Desist, and I will announce to thee what Jehovah spake to me by night. And they will say to him, Speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Samuel will say, Wert thou not little in thine eyes, thou the head of the tribes of Israel, and Jehovah will anoint thee for king over Israel?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Jehovah will send thee in the way, and he will say, Go, and utterly destroy the sinners Amalek, and fight against him even till ye consumed them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And wherefore didst thou not hear to the voice of Jehovah, and wilt clothe thyself with the spoil, and thou wilt do the evil in the eyes of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Saul will say to Samuel, That I heard to the voice of Jehovah, and I will go in the way which Jehovah sent me, and I will bring Agag king of Amalek, and I utterly destroyed Amalek.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the people will take from the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief devoted to sacrifice to Jehovah thy God in Gilgal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Samuel will say, Was it pleasing to Jehovah in burnt-offerings and sacrifices as to hear to the voice of Jehovah? Behold, to hear, above a good sacrifice, and to hearken, above the fat of rams.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For the sin of divination, rebellion; and deceit, and the family gods of stubbornness. Because thou didst reject the word of Jehovah, and he will reject thee from being king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Saul will say to Samuel, I sinned: for I passed by the mouth of Jehovah, and thy words: for I feared the people and I will hear to their voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And now, take away now, my sin, and turn back with me, and I will worship to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And Samuel will say to Saul, I will not turn back with thee, for thou didst reject the word of Jehovah, and Jehovah will reject thee from being king over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And Samuel will turn about to go, and he will seize upon the wing of his upper garment, and it will rend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And Samuel will say to him, Jehovah rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and gave it to thy neighbor being good above thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And also the glory of Israel will not lie, and he will not lament: for he not a man to lament.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And he will say, I sinned this time; honor me now before the old men of my people, and before Israel, and turn back with me, and I worshipped to Jehovah thy God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And Samuel will turn back after Saul; and Saul will worship to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And Samuel will say, Bring near to me Agag king of Amalek. And Agag will come to him, wavering: and Agag will say, Surely the bitterness of death was removed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And Samuel will say, As thy sword bereaved women of children, so of women shall thy mother be bereaved of children. And Samuel cut Agag in pieces before Jehovah in Gilgal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house of the hill of Saul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And Samuel will not add to see Saul, even to the day of his death: for Samuel mourned for Saul: and Jehovah lamented that he made Saul king over Israel.</p>
