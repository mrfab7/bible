<p class="verse" data-verse="1">AND I, brethren, when I came to you, came not in loftiness of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For I judged not myself to know anything among you, but Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasive words of human wisdom, but in shewing of the Spirit and power;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">That your faith might not stand on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Howbeit we speak wisdom among the perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world that come to nought;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, a wisdom which is hidden, which God ordained before the world, unto our glory :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Which none of the princes of this world knew; for if they had known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But, as it is written: That eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But to us God hath revealed them, by this Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that is in him? So the things also that are of God no man knoweth, but the Spirit of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now we have received not the spirit of this world, but the Spirit that is of God; that we may know the things that are given us from God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Which things also we speak, not in the learned words of human wisdom; but in the doctrine of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But the sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the Spirit of God; for it is foolishness to him, and he cannot understand, because it is spiritually examined.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But the spiritual man judgeth all things; and he himself is judged of no man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that we may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</p>
