<p class="verse" data-verse="1">In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city; salvation will he appoint for walls and bulwarks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth truth may enter in.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is an everlasting rock.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For he hath brought down them that dwell on high, the lofty city: he layeth it low, he layeth it low even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The foot shall tread it down; even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The way of the just is uprightness: thou that art up right dost direct the path of the just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; to thy name and to thy memorial is the desire of our soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness; in the land of uprightness will he deal wrongfully, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">LORD, thy hand is lifted up, yet they see not: but they shall see thy zeal for the people, and be ashamed; yea, fire shall devour thine adversaries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou hast also wrought all our works for us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over us; but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation; thou art glorified: thou hast enlarged all the borders of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been before thee, O LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thy dead shall live; my dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in the dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast forth the dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.</p>
