<p class="verse" data-verse="1">How beautiful art thou, my love, how beautiful art thou! thy eyes are dovesâ€™ eyes, besides what is hid within. Thy hair is as flocks of goats, which Come up from mount Galaad.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thy teeth as flocks of sheep, that are shorn which come up from the washing, all with twins, and there is none barren among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thy lips are as a scarlet lace: and thy speech sweet. Thy cheeks are as a piece of a pomegranate, besides that which lieth hid within.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thy neck, is as the tower of David, which is built with bulwarks: a thousand bucklers hang upon it, all the armour of valiant men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thy two breasts like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Till the day break, and the shadows retire, I will go to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thou art all fair, O my love, and there is not a spot in thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Come from Libanus, my spouse, come from Libanus, come: thou shalt be crowned from the top of Amana, from the top of Sanir and Hermon, from the dens of the lions, from the mountains of the leopards.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Thou hast wounded my heart, my sister, my spouse, thou hast wounded my heart with one of thy eyes, and with one hair of thy neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">How beautiful are thy breasts, my sister, my spouse! thy breasts are more beautiful than wine, and the sweet smell of thy ointments above all aromatical spices.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Thy lips, my spouse, are as a dropping honeycomb, honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments, as the smell of frankincense.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">My sister, my spouse, is a garden enclosed, a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Thy plants are a paradise of pomegranates with the fruits of the orchard. Cypress with spikenard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Spikenard and saffron, sweet cane and cinnamon, with all the trees of Libanus, myrrh and aloes with all the chief perfumes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The fountain of gardens: the well of living waters, which run with a strong stream from Libanus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Arise, O north wind, and come, O south wind, blow through my garden, and let the aromatical spices thereof flow.</p>
