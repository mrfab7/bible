<chapter book="Proverbs" number="30" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The words of Agur the son of Jakeh; the oracle. The man saith unto Ithiel, unto Ithiel and Ucal:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Surely I am more brutish than any man, And have not the understanding of a man;</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I have not learned wisdom, Neither have I the knowledge of the Holy One.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who hath ascended up into heaven, and descended? Who hath gathered the wind in his fists? Who hath bound the waters in his garment? Who hath established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son’s name, if thou knowest?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Every word of God is tried: He is a shield unto them that take refuge in him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Add thou not unto his words, Lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Two things have I asked of thee; Deny me them not before I die:</verse>
  <verse number="8">Remove far from me falsehood and lies; Give me neither poverty nor riches; Feed me with the food that is needful for me:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is Jehovah? Or lest I be poor, and steal, And use profanely the name of my God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Slander not a servant unto his master, Lest he curse thee, and thou be held guilty.</verse>
  <verse number="11">There is a generation that curse their father, And bless not their mother.</verse>
  <verse number="12">There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, And yet are not washed from their filthiness.</verse>
  <verse number="13">There is a generation, oh how lofty are their eyes! And their eyelids are lifted up.</verse>
  <verse number="14">There is a generation whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, To devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, Yea, four that say not, Enough:</verse>
  <verse number="16">Sheol; and the barren womb; The earth that is not satisfied with water; And the fire that saith not, Enough.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The eye that mocketh at his father, And despiseth to obey his mother, The ravens of the valley shall pick it out, And the young eagles shall eat it.</verse>
  <verse number="18">There are three things which are too wonderful for me, Yea, four which I know not:</verse>
  <verse number="19">The way of an eagle in the air; The way of a serpent upon a rock; The way of a ship in the midst of the sea; And the way of a man with a maiden.</verse>
  <verse number="20">So is the way of an adulterous woman; She eateth, and wipeth her mouth, And saith, I have done no wickedness.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For three things the earth doth tremble, And for four, which it cannot bear:</verse>
  <verse number="22">For a servant when he is king; And a fool when he is filled with food;</verse>
  <verse number="23">For an odious woman when she is married; And a handmaid that is heir to her mistress.</verse>
  <verse number="24">There are four things which are little upon the earth, But they are exceeding wise:</verse>
  <verse number="25">The ants are a people not strong, Yet they provide their food in the summer;</verse>
  <verse number="26">The conies are but a feeble folk, Yet make they their houses in the rocks;</verse>
  <verse number="27">The locusts have no king, Yet go they forth all of them by bands;</verse>
  <verse number="28">The lizard taketh hold with her hands, Yet is she in kings’ palaces.</verse>
  <verse number="29">There are three things which are stately in their march, Yea, four which are stately in going:</verse>
  <verse number="30">The lion, which is mightiest among beasts, And turneth not away for any;</verse>
  <verse number="31">The greyhound; the he-goat also; And the king against whom there is no rising up.</verse>
  <verse number="32">If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, Or if thou hast thought evil, Lay thy hand upon thy mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="33">For the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, And the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood; So the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.</verse>
