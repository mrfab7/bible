  <verse number="1">But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called [thee] by thy name; thou [art] mine.</verse>
  <verse number="2">When thou passest through the waters, I [will be] with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For I [am] the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour: I gave Egypt [for] thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Fear not: for I [am] with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;</verse>
  <verse number="6">I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;</verse>
  <verse number="7">[Even] every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, [It is] truth.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Ye [are] my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I [am] he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I, [even] I, [am] the LORD; and beside me [there is] no saviour.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when [there was] no strange [god] among you: therefore ye [are] my witnesses, saith the LORD, that I [am] God.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Yea, before the day [was] I [am] he; and [there is] none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry [is] in the ships.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I [am] the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;</verse>
  <verse number="17">Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as tow.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, [and] rivers in the desert.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, [and] rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.</verse>
  <verse number="21">This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.</verse>
  <verse number="25">I, [even] I, [am] he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.</verse>
