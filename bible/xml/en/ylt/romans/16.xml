  <verse number="1">And I commend you to Phebe our sister—being a ministrant of the assembly that is in Cenchrea—</verse>
  <verse number="2">that ye may receive her in the Lord, as doth become saints, and may assist her in whatever matter she may have need of you—for she also became a leader of many, and of myself.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Salute Priscilla and Aquilas, my fellow-workmen in Christ Jesus—</verse>
  <verse number="4">who for my life their own neck did lay down, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the assemblies of the nations—</verse>
  <verse number="5">and the assembly at their house; salute Epaenetus, my beloved, who is first-fruit of Achaia to Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Salute Mary, who did labour much for us;</verse>
  <verse number="7">salute Andronicus and Junias, my kindred, and my fellow-captives, who are of note among the apostles, who also have been in Christ before me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Salute Amplias, my beloved in the Lord;</verse>
  <verse number="9">salute Arbanus, our fellow-workman in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved;</verse>

  <verse number="17">And I call upon you, brethren, to mark those who the divisions and the stumbling-blocks, contrary to the teaching that ye did learn, are causing, and turn ye away from them;</verse>
  <verse number="18">for such our Lord Jesus Christ do not serve, but their own belly; and through the good word and fair speech they deceive the hearts of the harmless,</verse>
  <verse number="19">for your obedience did reach to all; I rejoice, therefore, as regards you, and I wish you to be wise, indeed, as to the good, and harmless as to the evil;</verse>
  <verse number="20">and the God of the peace shall bruise the Adversary under your feet quickly; the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen!</verse>
  <verse number="21">Salute you do Timotheus, my fellow-workman, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kindred;</verse>
  <verse number="22">I Tertius salute you (who wrote the letter) in the Lord;</verse>
  <verse number="23">salute you doth Gaius, my host, and of the whole assembly; salute you doth Erastus, the steward of the city, and Quartus the brother,</verse>
  <verse number="24">the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And to Him who is able to establish you, according to my good news, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the secret, in the times of the ages having been kept silent,</verse>
  <verse number="26">and now having been made manifest, also, through prophetic writings, according to a command of the age-during God, having been made known to all the nations for obedience of faith—</verse>
  <verse number="27">to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to him be glory to the ages. Amen.</verse>
