<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Oh that my vexation were but weighed, And my calamity laid in the balances altogether!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; Therefore are my words broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, The poison whereof my spirit drinketh up; The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? Or loweth the ox over his fodder?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Can that which hath no savour be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the juice of mallows?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">My soul refuseth to touch them; They are as the sickness of my flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Oh that I might have my request, And that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Even that it would please God to crush me; That He would let loose His hand, and cut me off!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then should I yet have comfort; Yea, I would exult in pain, though He spare not; For I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is mine end, that I should be patient?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of brass?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Is it that I have no help in me, And that sound wisdom is driven quite from me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">To him that is ready to faint kindness is due from his friend, Even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, As the channel of brooks that overflow,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Which are black by reason of the ice, And wherein the snow hideth itself;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">What time they wax warm, they vanish, When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The paths of their way do wind, They go up into the waste, and are lost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The caravans of Tema looked, The companies of Sheba waited for them—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">They were ashamed because they had hoped; They came thither, and were confounded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For now ye are become His; Ye see a terror, and are afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Did I say: ‘Give unto me’? Or: ‘Offer a present for me of your substance’ ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">or: ‘Deliver me from the adversary’s hand’? Or: ‘Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors’ ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Teach me, and I will hold my peace; And cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">How forcible are words of uprightness! But what doth your arguing argue?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Do ye hold words to be an argument, But the speeches of one that is desperate to be wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Yea, ye would cast lots upon the fatherless, And dig a pit for your friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Now therefore be pleased to look upon me; For surely I shall not lie to your face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice; Yea, return again, my cause is righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern crafty devices?</p>
