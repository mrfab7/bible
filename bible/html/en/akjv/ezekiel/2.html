<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And he said to me, Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me on my feet, that I heard him that spoke to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he said to me, Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even to this very day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For they are impudent children and stiff hearted. I do send you to them; and you shall say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with you, and you do dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And you shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But you, son of man, hear what I say to you; Be not you rebellious like that rebellious house: open your mouth, and eat that I give you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent to me; and, see, a roll of a book was therein;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</p>
