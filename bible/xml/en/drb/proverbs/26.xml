  <verse number="1">As snow in summer, and rain in harvest, so glory is not seemly for a fool.</verse>
  <verse number="2">As a bird flying to other places, and a sparrow going here or there: so a curse uttered without cause shall come upon a man.</verse>
  <verse number="3">A whip for a horse, and a snaffle for an ass, and a rod for the back of fools.</verse>

  <verse number="7">As a lame man hath fair legs in vain: so a parable is unseemly in the mouth of fools.</verse>
  <verse number="8">As he that casteth a stone into the heap of Mercury: so is he that giveth honour to a fool.</verse>
  <verse number="9">As if a thorn should grow in the hand of a drunkard: so is a parable in the mouth of fools.</verse>

  <verse number="11">As a dog that returneth to his vomit, so is the fool that repeateth his folly.</verse>

  <verse number="16">The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit, than seven men that speak sentences.</verse>
  <verse number="17">As he that taketh a dog by the ears, so is he that passeth by in anger, and meddleth with another man’s quarrel.</verse>
  <verse number="18">As he is guilty that shooteth arrows, and lances unto death :</verse>
  <verse number="19">So is the man that hurteth his friend deceitfully: and when he is taken, saith: I did it in jest.</verse>
  <verse number="20">When the wood faileth, the fire shall go out: and when the talebearer is taken away, contentions shall cease.</verse>

  <verse number="22">The words of a talebearer are as it were simple, but they reach to the innermost parts of the belly.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Swelling lips joined with a corrupt heart, are like an earthen vessel adorned with silver dross.</verse>

  <verse number="26">He that covereth hatred deceitfully, his malice shall be laid open in the public assembly.</verse>
  <verse number="27">He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that rolleth a stone, it shall return to him.</verse>
  <verse number="28">A deceitful tongue loveth not truth: and a slippery mouth worketh ruin.</verse>
