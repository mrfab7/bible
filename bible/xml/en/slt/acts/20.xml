  <verse number="1">And after the uproar was ceased, Paul having called the disciples, and greeted, he came out to go into Macedonia.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And having passed through those parts, and having besought them by much speech, he came into Greece.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And having made three months; an insidious plot having been for him by the Jews, being about to sail to Syria, there was a purpose to return through Macedonia.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And there agreed with him as far as Asia Sopater a Berean; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus: and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus.</verse>
  <verse number="5">These having come before awaited us in Troas.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And we sailed forth after the days of unleavened from Philippi, and came to them in Troas up to five days; where we tarried seven days.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And in one of the sabbaths, the disciples having been assembled together to break bread, Paul conversed with them being about to go forth the morrow; and he continued the word until midnight.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And sufficient lights were in the upper room, where they were assembled.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And a certain young man by name Eutychus, sitting in the window, borne down by deep sleep, Paul conversing more and more, fell down below from the third story, and was taken up dead.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Paul having gone down, fell upon him, and embracing, said, Be not disturbed, for his soul is in him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And having gone up, and broken bread, and tasted, and conversed for a sufficient time, till the light, so he went forth.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they brought the child living, and were not little comforted.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And we having gone before to the ship, sailed to Assos, there being about to take up Paul: for so had he ordered, being about himself to go on foot.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And when he joined us at Assos, having taken him up, we came to Mitylene.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And from thence having sailed away, the following day we arrived over against Chios; and the other day we approached to Samos, and having remained in Trogyllium, the following day we came to Miletus.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For Paul determined to sail to Ephesus, as it might not be to him to spend the time in Asia: for he hastened, if it were possible to him, to be in Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And having sent from Miletus to Ephesus, he called for the elders of the church.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And when they came to him, he said to them, Ye know, from the first day in which I embarked for Asia, how I was with you all the time.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Serving the Lord with all humility, and many tears, and temptations, having happened to me by the insidious plots of the Jews:</verse>
  <verse number="20">How I concealed nothing of things profitable, not to announce to you, and teach you publicly, and in the houses,</verse>
  <verse number="21">Testifying to both Jews, and Greeks, repentance towards God, and the faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And now, behold, I, bound in the spirit, am going to Jerusalem, not knowing the things going to happen to me in it;</verse>
  <verse number="23">But that the Holy Spirit testifies in the city, saying that bonds and pressures await me.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But the word of none do I make mine own, neither have I my soul highly prized to myself, in order to finish my course with joy, and the service which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify the good news of the grace of God.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And now, behold, I know that all ye shall see my face no more, among whom I passed through, proclaiming the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Wherefore I testify to you in this day, that I pure from the blood of all.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For I concealed not to announce to you all the counsel of God.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Attend therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit set you inspectors, to feed the church of God, which he acquired by his own blood.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For I know this, that there shall come in after my departure grievous wolves to you, not sparing the flock.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And of yourselves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to tear away disciples after them.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Wherefore watch ye, remembering that the space of three years night and day I ceased not reminding each one with tears.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And now I commit you, brethren, to God, and to the word of his grace, being able to build up, and give you inheritance among all the consecrated.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Silver or gold, or clothing, of none have I eagerly desired.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And ye yourselves know, that to my necessities, and to those being with me, these hands served.</verse>
  <verse number="35">I shewed you all things, that so being wearied ye must support the weak, and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that himself said, It is happy to give rather than receive.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And having said these, having placed his knees, he prayed with them all.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And much weeping was from all; and having fallen upon Paul’s neck, they kissed him,</verse>
  <verse number="38">Grieving chiefly for the word which he spake, that they are about to see his face no more. And they sent him forward to the ship.</verse>
