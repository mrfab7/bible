<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="27" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Boast not thyself of to-morrow; For thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; A stranger, and not thine own lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; But a fool’s vexation is heavier than they both.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming; But who is able to stand before jealousy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Better is open rebuke Than love that is hidden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Faithful are the wounds of a friend; But the kisses of an enemy are profuse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The full soul loatheth a honeycomb; But to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">As a bird that wandereth from her nest, So is a man that wandereth from his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Oil and perfume rejoice the heart; So doth the sweetness of a man’s friend that cometh of hearty counsel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not; And go not to thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity: Better is a neighbor that is near than a brother far off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, That I may answer him that reproacheth me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A prudent man seeth the evil, and hideth himself; But the simple pass on, and suffer for it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; And hold him in pledge that is surety for a foreign woman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, It shall be counted a curse to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">A continual dropping in a very rainy day And a contentious woman are alike:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He that would restrain her restraineth the wind; And his right hand encountereth oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Iron sharpeneth iron; So a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Whoso keepeth the fig-tree shall eat the fruit thereof; And he that regardeth his master shall be honored.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">As in water face answereth to face, So the heart of man to man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; And the eyes of man are never satisfied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold; And a man is tried by his praise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with bruised grain, Yet will not his foolishness depart from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, And look well to thy herds:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For riches are not for ever: And doth the crown endure unto all generations?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The hay is carried, and the tender grass showeth itself, And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The lambs are for thy clothing, And the goats are the price of the field;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And there will be goats’ milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, And maintenance for thy maidens.</p>
