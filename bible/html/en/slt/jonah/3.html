<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the word of Jehovah will be to Jonah the second time, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Arise, go to Nineveh the great city, and call to it the calling which I speak to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Jonah will rise and go to Nineveh according to the word of Jehovah. And Nineveh was a great city to God, the going of three days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Jonah will begin to go in to the city the going of one day, and he will call, and say, Yet forty days and Nineveh being overthrown.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the men of Nineveh will believe in God, and they will call a fast, and put on sackcloth, from great and even to small.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the word will reach to the king of Nineveh, and he will rise from his throne, and he will take away his wide cloak from off him, and he will cover with sackcloth, and he will sit upon ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he will cry out and say in Nineveh from the edict of the king and of his great ones, saying, The man and beast, the herd and flock shall not taste of anything; they shall not feed and they shall not drink water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And man and beast shall be covered with sackcloth, and they shall cry with strength to Jehovah: and they shall turn back each from his evil way, and the violence which is in their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who shall know God will turn back and lament, and turning back from the burning of his anger and we shall not perish?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And God will see their works that they turned back from their evil way, and God will lament for the evil which he spake to do to them: and he did it not.</p>
