<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And I lift up mine eyes, and look, and lo, a man, and in his hand a measuring line.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And I say, ‘Whither are thou going?’ And he saith unto me, ‘To measure Jerusalem, to see how much is its breadth, and how much its length.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And lo, the messenger who is speaking with me is going out, and another messenger is going out to meet him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and he saith unto him, ‘Run, speak unto this young man, saying: Unwalled villages inhabit doth Jerusalem, From the abundance of man and beast in her midst.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And I—I am to her—an affirmation of Jehovah, A wall of fire round about, And for honour I am in her midst.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Ho, ho, and flee from the land of the north, An affirmation of Jehovah, For, as the four winds of the heavens, I have spread you abroad, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Ho, Zion, be delivered who art dwelling with the daughter of Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For thus said Jehovah of Hosts: After honour He hath sent me unto the nations who are spoiling you, For he who is coming against you, Is coming against the daughter of His eye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For lo, I am waving my hand against them, And they have been a spoil to their servants. And ye have known that Jehovah of Hosts hath sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Singe, and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, For lo, I am coming, and have dwelt in thy midst, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And joined have been many nations unto Jehovah in that day, And they have been to Me for a people, And I have dwelt in thy midst, And thou hast known that Jehovah of Hosts hath sent me unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Jehovah hath inherited Judah, His portion on the holy ground, And He hath fixed again on Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hush, all flesh, because of Jehovah, For He hath been roused up from His holy habitation!’</p>
