<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I Made a covenant with my eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know my integrity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If my step hath turned out of the way, and my heart walked after my eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to my hands;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then let me sow, and let another eat; yes, let my offspring be rooted out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">If my heart hath been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbor’s door;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then let my wife grind to another, and let others bow down upon her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For this is a hainous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all my increase.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I despised the cause of my man-servant or of my maid-servant, when they contended with me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten of it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother’s womb;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">If his loins have not blessed me, and if he hath not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Then let my arm fall from my shoulder-blade, and my arm be broken from the bone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gained much;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">If I have beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or have lifted up myself when evil found him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">If the men of my tabernacle have not said, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveler.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If I have covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that my adversary had written a book.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">I would declare to him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">If my land crieth against me, or its furrows likewise complain;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">If I have eaten the fruits of it without money, or have caused its owners to lose their life:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.</p>
