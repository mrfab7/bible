<p class="verse" data-verse="1">To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A time to be born, and a time to die; A time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A time to kill, and a time to heal; A time to break down, and a time to build up;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A time to weep, and a time to laugh; A time to mourn, and a time to dance;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">A time to seek, and a time to lose; A time to keep, and a time to cast away;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">A time to rend, and a time to sew; A time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">A time to love, and a time to hate; A time for war, and a time for peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What profit hath he that worketh in that he laboureth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I have seen the task which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He hath made every thing beautiful in its time; also He hath set the world in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that God hath done from the beginning even to the end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to get pleasure so long as they live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy pleasure for all his labour, is the gift of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever; nothing can be added to it, nor any thing taken from it; and God hath so made it, that men should fear before Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">That which is hath been long ago, and that which is to be hath already been; and God seeketh that which is pursued.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I said in my heart: ‘The righteous and the wicked God will judge; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I said in my heart: ‘It is because of the sons of men, that God may sift them, and that they may see that they themselves are but as beasts.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them; as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that man hath no pre-eminence above a beast; for all is vanity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all return to dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Who knoweth the spirit of man whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast whether it goeth downward to the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Wherefore I perceived that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion; for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</p>
