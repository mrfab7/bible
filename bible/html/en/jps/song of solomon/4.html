<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; Thine eyes are as doves behind thy veil; Thy hair is as a flock of goats, that trail down from mount Gilead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes all shaped alike, Which are come up from the washing; Whereof all are paired, and none faileth among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, And thy mouth is comely; Thy temples are like a pomegranate split open Behind thy veil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thy neck is like the tower of David Builded with turrets, Whereon there hang a thousand shields, All the armour of the mighty men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thy two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a gazelle, Which feed among the lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Until the day breathe, And the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, And to the hill of frankincense.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thou art all fair, my love; And there is no spot in thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, With me from Lebanon; Look from the top of Amana, From the top of Senir and Hermon, From the lions’ dens, From the mountains of the leopards.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my bride; Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, With one bead of thy necklace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">How fair is thy love, my sister, my bride! How much better is thy love than wine! And the smell of thine ointments than all manner of spices!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Thy lips, O my bride, drop honey—Honey and milk are under thy tongue; And the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A garden shut up is my sister, my bride; A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Thy shoots are a park of pomegranates, With precious fruits; Henna with spikenard plants,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Spikenard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, With all trees of frankincense; Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thou art a fountain of gardens, A well of living waters, And flowing streams from Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Awake, O north wind; And come, thou south; Blow upon my garden, That the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, And eat his precious fruits.</p>
