<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with certain elders, and with an orator, one Tertullus; and they informed the governor against Paul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy much peace, and that by thy providence evils are corrected for this nation,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I entreat thee to hear us of thy clemency a few words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">who moreover assayed to profane the temple: on whom also we laid hold:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7"></p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">from whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself, to take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that these things were so.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And when the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, Paul answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do cheerfully make my defence:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">seeing that thou canst take knowledge, that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">and neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man or stirring up a crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Neither can they prove to thee the things whereof they now accuse me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of our fathers, believing all things which are according to the law, and which are written in the prophets:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection both of the just and unjust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Herein do I also exercise myself to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men alway.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">amidst which they found me purified in the temple, with no crowd, nor yet with tumult: but there were certain Jews from Asiaâ€”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">who ought to have been here before thee, and to make accusation, if they had aught against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Or else let these men themselves say what wrong-doing they found, when I stood before the council,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question before you this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way, deferred them, saying, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he gave order to the centurion that he should be kept in charge, and should have indulgence; and not to forbid any of his friends to minister unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But after certain days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife, which was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And as he reasoned of righteousness, and temperance, and the judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered, Go thy way for this time; and when I have a convenient season, I will call thee unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He hoped withal that money would be given him of Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favour with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.</p>
