<div class="chapter" data-book="Hosea" data-chapter="11" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The more the prophets called them, the more they went from them: they sacrificed unto the Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Yet I taught Ephraim to walk; I took them on my arms; but they knew not that I healed them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love; and I was to them as they that lift up the yoke on their jaws; and I laid food before them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">They shall not return into the land of Egypt; but the Assyrian shall be their king, because they refused to return to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the sword shall fall upon their cities, and shall consume their bars, and devour them, because of their own counsels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And my people are bent on backsliding from me: though they call them to him that is on high, none at all will exalt him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I cast thee off, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboiim? my heart is turned within me, my compassions are kindled together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee; and I will not come in wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They shall walk after Jehovah, who will roar like a lion; for he will roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will make them to dwell in their houses, saith Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Ephraim compasseth me about with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the Holy One.</p>
