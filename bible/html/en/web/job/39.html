<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="39" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“Do you know the time when the mountain goats give birth? Do you watch when the doe bears fawns?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Can you number the months that they fulfill? Or do you know the time when they give birth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, they end their labor pains.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Their young ones become strong. They grow up in the open field. They go forth, and don’t return again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">“Who has set the wild donkey free? Or who has loosened the bonds of the swift donkey,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Whose home I have made the wilderness, and the salt land his dwelling place?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He scorns the tumult of the city, neither does he hear the shouting of the driver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The range of the mountains is his pasture, He searches after every green thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">“Will the wild ox be content to serve you? Or will he stay by your feeding trough?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Can you hold the wild ox in the furrow with his harness? Or will he till the valleys after you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Will you trust him, because his strength is great? Or will you leave to him your labor?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Will you confide in him, that he will bring home your seed, and gather the grain of your threshing floor?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">“The wings of the ostrich wave proudly; but are they the feathers and plumage of love?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For she leaves her eggs on the earth, warms them in the dust,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and forgets that the foot may crush them, or that the wild animal may trample them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">She deals harshly with her young ones, as if they were not hers. Though her labor is in vain, she is without fear,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">because God has deprived her of wisdom, neither has he imparted to her understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">When she lifts up herself on high, she scorns the horse and his rider.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">“Have you given the horse might? Have you clothed his neck with a quivering mane?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Have you made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is awesome.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength. He goes out to meet the armed men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He mocks at fear, and is not dismayed, neither does he turn back from the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The quiver rattles against him, the flashing spear and the javelin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He eats up the ground with fierceness and rage, neither does he stand still at the sound of the trumpet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">As often as the trumpet sounds he snorts, ‘Aha!’ He smells the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">“Is it by your wisdom that the hawk soars, and stretches her wings toward the south?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up, and makes his nest on high?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">On the cliff he dwells, and makes his home, on the point of the cliff, and the stronghold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">From there he spies out the prey. His eyes see it afar off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">His young ones also suck up blood. Where the slain are, there he is.”</p>
