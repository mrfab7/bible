<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="6" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, if you be surety for your friend, if you have stricken your hand with a stranger,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">You are snared with the words of your mouth, you are taken with the words of your mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, when you are come into the hand of your friend; go, humble yourself, and make sure your friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Give not sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Deliver yourself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Go to the ant, you sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Provides her meat in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">How long will you sleep, O sluggard? when will you arise out of your sleep?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">So shall your poverty come as one that travels, and your want as an armed man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A naughty person, a wicked man, walks with a fraudulent mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He winks with his eyes, he speaks with his feet, he teaches with his fingers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Frowardness is in his heart, he devises mischief continually; he sows discord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">These six things does the LORD hate: yes, seven are an abomination to him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">An heart that devises wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A false witness that speaks lies, and he that sows discord among brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My son, keep your father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of your mother:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Bind them continually on your heart, and tie them about your neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">When you go, it shall lead you; when you sleep, it shall keep you; and when you wake, it shall talk with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">To keep you from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Lust not after her beauty in your heart; neither let her take you with her eyelids.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Can one go on hot coals, and his feet not be burned?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">So he that goes in to his neighbor’s wife; whoever touches her shall not be innocent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">But whoever commits adultery with a woman lacks understanding: he that does it destroys his own soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">A wound and dishonor shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.</p>
