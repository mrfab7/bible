  <verse number="1">And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;</verse>
  <verse number="2">Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love with which he loved us,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)</verse>
  <verse number="6">And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:</verse>
  <verse number="7">That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Not of works, lest any man should boast.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God has before ordained that we should walk in them.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Why remember, that you being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;</verse>
  <verse number="12">That at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:</verse>
  <verse number="13">But now in Christ Jesus you who sometimes were far off are made near by the blood of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;</verse>
  <verse number="15">Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of two one new man, so making peace;</verse>
  <verse number="16">And that he might reconcile both to God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:</verse>
  <verse number="17">And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were near.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God;</verse>
  <verse number="20">And are built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;</verse>
  <verse number="21">In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:</verse>
  <verse number="22">In whom you also are built together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.</verse>
