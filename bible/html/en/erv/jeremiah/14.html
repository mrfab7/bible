<div class="chapter" data-book="Jeremiah" data-chapter="14" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish, they sit in black upon the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And their nobles send their little ones to the waters: they come to the pits, and find no water; they return with their vessels empty: they are ashamed and confounded, and cover their heads.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Because of the ground which is chapt, for that no rain hath been in the land, the plowmen are ashamed, they cover their heads.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Yea, the hind also in the field calveth, and forsaketh her young, because there is no grass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the wild asses stand on the bare heights, they pant for air like jackals; their eyes fail, because there is no herbage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Though our iniquities testify against us, work thou for thy name’s sake, O LORD: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">O thou hope of Israel, the saviour thereof in the time of trouble, why shouldest thou be as a sojourner in the land, and as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Why shouldest thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thus saith the LORD unto this people, Even so have they loved to wander; they have not refrained their feet: therefore the LORD doth not accept them; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the LORD said unto me, Pray not for this people for their good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you assured peace in this place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then the LORD said unto me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, neither have I commanded them, neither spake I unto them: they prophesy unto you a lying vision, and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit of their own heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have none to bury them, them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters: for I will pour their wickedness upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And thou shalt say this word unto them, Let mine eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease; for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous wound.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest go about in the land and have no knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul loathed Zion? why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of healing, and behold dismay!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers: for we have sinned against thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Do not abhor us, for thy name’s sake; do not disgrace the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Are there any among the vanities of the heathen that can cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? art not thou he, O LORD our God? therefore we will wait upon thee; for thou hast made all these things.</p>
