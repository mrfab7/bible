<chapter book="Exodus" number="18" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father in law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt;</verse>
  <verse number="2">Then Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her back,</verse>
  <verse number="3">And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the name of the other was Eliezer; for the God of my father, said he, was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God:</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he said to Moses, I your father in law Jethro am come to you, and your wife, and her two sons with her.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Moses went out to meet his father in law, and did obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other of their welfare; and they came into the tent.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Moses told his father in law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, and all the travail that had come on them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing wherein they dealt proudly he was above them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Jethro, Moses’ father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father in law before God.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning to the evening.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that you do to the people? why sit you yourself alone, and all the people stand by you from morning to even?</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Moses said to his father in law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God:</verse>
  <verse number="16">When they have a matter, they come to me; and I judge between one and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Moses’ father in law said to him, The thing that you do is not good.</verse>
  <verse number="18">You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you: for this thing is too heavy for you; you are not able to perform it yourself alone.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Listen now to my voice, I will give you counsel, and God shall be with you: Be you for the people to God-ward, that you may bring the causes to God:</verse>
  <verse number="20">And you shall teach them ordinances and laws, and shall show them the way wherein they must walk, and the work that they must do.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens:</verse>
  <verse number="22">And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for yourself, and they shall bear the burden with you.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If you shall do this thing, and God command you so, then you shall be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.</verse>
  <verse number="24">So Moses listened to the voice of his father in law, and did all that he had said.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And Moses let his father in law depart; and he went his way into his own land.</verse>
