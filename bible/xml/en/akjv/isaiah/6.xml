<chapter book="Isaiah" number="6" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the middle of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then flew one of the seraphim to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he laid it on my mouth, and said, See, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin purged.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear you indeed, but understand not; and see you indeed, but perceive not.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate,</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great forsaking in the middle of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.</verse>
