<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I exhort therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings be made for all men;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">for kings and all that are in dignity, that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all piety and gravity;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">for this is good and acceptable before our Saviour God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">who desires that all men should be saved and come to [the] knowledge of [the] truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For God is one, and [the] mediator of God and men one, [the] man Christ Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">who gave himself a ransom for all, the testimony [to be rendered] in its own times;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">to which I have been appointed a herald and apostle, (I speak [the] truth, I do not lie,) a teacher of [the] nations in faith and truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I will therefore that the men pray in every place, lifting up pious hands, without wrath or reasoning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">In like manner also that the women in decent deportment and dress adorn themselves with modesty and discretion, not with plaited [hair] and gold, or pearls, or costly clothing,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">but, what becomes women making profession of the fear of God, by good works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Let a woman learn in quietness in all subjection;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">but I do not suffer a woman to teach nor to exercise authority over man, but to be in quietness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">for Adam was formed first, then Eve:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and Adam was not deceived; but the woman, having been deceived, was in transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But she shall be preserved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with discretion.</p>
