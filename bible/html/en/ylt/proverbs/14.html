<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="14" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Every wise woman hath builded her house, And the foolish with her hands breaketh it down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Whoso is walking in his uprightness is fearing Jehovah, And the perverted in his ways is despising Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">In the mouth of a fool is a rod of pride, And the lips of the wise preserve them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Without oxen a stall is clean, And great is the increase by the power of the ox.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A faithful witness lieth not, And a false witness breatheth out lies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">A scorner hath sought wisdom, and it is not, And knowledge to the intelligent is easy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Go from before a foolish man, Or thou hast not known the lips of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way, And the folly of fools is deceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Fools mock at a guilt-offering, And among the upright—a pleasing thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The heart knoweth its own bitterness, And with its joy a stranger doth not intermeddle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The house of the wicked is destroyed, And the tent of the upright flourisheth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">There is a way—right before a man, And its latter end are ways of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Even in laughter is the heart pained, And the latter end of joy is affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">From his ways is the backslider in heart filled, And a good man—from his fruits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The simple giveth credence to everything, And the prudent attendeth to his step.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The wise is fearing and turning from evil, And a fool is transgressing and is confident.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Whoso is short of temper doth folly, And a man of wicked devices is hated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The simple have inherited folly, And the prudent are crowned with knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The evil have bowed down before the good, And the wicked at the gates of the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Even of his neighbour is the poor hated, And those loving the rich are many.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Whoso is despising his neighbour sinneth, Whoso is favouring the humble, O his happiness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Do not they err who are devising evil? And kindness and truth are to those devising good,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">In all labour there is advantage, And a thing of the lips is only to want.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The crown of the wise is their wealth, The folly of fools is folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">A true witness is delivering souls, And a deceitful one breatheth out lies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">In the fear of Jehovah is strong confidence, And to His sons there is a refuge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The fear of Jehovah is a fountain of life, To turn aside from snares of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">In the multitude of a people is the honour of a king, And in lack of people the ruin of a prince.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Whoso is slow to anger is of great understanding, And whoso is short in temper is exalting folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">A healed heart is life to the flesh, And rottenness to the bones is envy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">An oppressor of the poor reproacheth his Maker, And whoso is honouring Him Is favouring the needy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">In his wickedness is the wicked driven away, And trustful in his death is the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">In the heart of the intelligent wisdom doth rest. And in the midst of fools it is known.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Righteousness exalteth a nation, And the goodliness of peoples is a sin-offering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">The favour of a king is to a wise servant, And an object of his wrath is one causing shame!</p>
