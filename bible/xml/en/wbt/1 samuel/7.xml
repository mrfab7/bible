  <verse number="1">And the men of Kirjath-jearim came, and brought up the ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjath-jearim, that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do return to the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange gods, and Ashtaroth, from among you, and prepare your hearts to the LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you from the hand of the Philistines.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then the children of Israel put away Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and served the LORD only.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for you to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And they assembled at Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and there said, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in Mizpeh.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were assembled at Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry to the LORD our God for us, that he will save us from the hand of the Philistines.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt-offering wholly to the LORD: and Samuel cried to the LORD for Israel; and the LORD heard him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And as Samuel was offering the burnt-offering, the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten before Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Beth-car.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD helped us.</verse>
  <verse number="13">So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the borders of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and the borders of it did Israel deliver from the hands of the Philistines: and there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he went from year to year in circuit to Beth-el, and Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar to the LORD.</verse>
