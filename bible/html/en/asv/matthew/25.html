<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And five of them were foolish, and five were wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Now while the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But at midnight there is a cry, Behold, the bridegroom! Come ye forth to meet him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are going out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But the wise answered, saying, Peradventure there will not be enough for us and you: go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And while they went away to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage feast: and the door was shut.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Watch therefore, for ye know not the day nor the hour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For it is as when a man, going into another country, called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his several ability; and he went on his journey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Straightway he that received the five talents went and traded with them, and made other five talents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">In like manner he also that received the two gained other two.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But he that received the one went away and digged in the earth, and hid his lordâ€™s money.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Now after a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and maketh a reckoning with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And he that received the five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: lo, I have gained other five talents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And he also that received the two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: lo, I have gained other two talents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And he also that had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou didst not sow, and gathering where thou didst not scatter;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">and I was afraid, and went away and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, thou hast thine own.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But his lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I did not scatter;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back mine own with interest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him that hath the ten talents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And cast ye out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But when the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">and before him shall be gathered all the nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">for I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee? or athirst, and gave thee drink?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And when saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these my brethren, even these least, ye did it unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">for I was hungry, and ye did not give me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">Then shall they also answer, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not unto one of these least, ye did it not unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">And these shall go away into eternal punishment: but the righteous into eternal life.</p>
