  <verse number="1">And he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had his hand withered.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day; that they might accuse him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he saith unto the man that had his hand withered, Stand forth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he saith unto them, Is it lawful on the sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? to save a life, or to kill? But they held their peace.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And when he had looked round about on them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their heart, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the Pharisees went out, and straightway with the Herodians took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Jesus with his disciples withdrew to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed: and from Judaea,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and beyond Jordan, and about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came unto him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he spake to his disciples, that a little boat should wait on him because of the crowd, lest they should throng him:</verse>
  <verse number="10">for he had healed many; insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed upon him that they might touch him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the unclean spirits, whensoever they beheld him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he charged them much that they should not make him known.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he goeth up into the mountain, and calleth unto him whom he himself would: and they went unto him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach,</verse>
  <verse number="15">and to have authority to cast out devils:</verse>
  <verse number="16">and Simon he surnamed Peter;</verse>
  <verse number="17">and James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and them he surnamed Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:</verse>
  <verse number="18">and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,</verse>
  <verse number="19">and Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him. And he cometh into a house.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And when his friends heard it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, He is beside himself.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He hath Beelzebub, and, By the prince of the devils casteth he out the devils.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he called them unto him, and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
  <verse number="24">And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And if a house be divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And if Satan hath risen up against himself, and is divided, he cannot stand, but hath an end.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But no one can enter into the house of the strong man, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man; and then he will spoil his house.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Verily I say unto you, All their sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and their blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme:</verse>
  <verse number="29">but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit hath never forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin:</verse>
  <verse number="30">because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And there come his mother and his brethren; and, standing without, they sent unto him, calling him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And a multitude was sitting about him; and they say unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek for thee.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And he answereth them, and saith, Who is my mother and my brethren?</verse>
  <verse number="34">And looking round on them which sat round about him, he saith, Behold, my mother and my brethren!</verse>
  <verse number="35">For whosoever shall do the will of God, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.</verse>
