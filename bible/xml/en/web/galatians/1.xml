<chapter book="Galatians" number="1" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),</verse>
  <verse number="2">and all the brothers who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
  <verse number="4">who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father—</verse>
  <verse number="5">to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different “good news”;</verse>
  <verse number="7">and there isn’t another “good news.” Only there are some who trouble you, and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any “good news” other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any “good news” other than that which you received, let him be cursed.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn’t be a servant of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace,</verse>
  <verse number="16">to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn’t immediately confer with flesh and blood,</verse>
  <verse number="17">nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But of the other apostles I saw no one, except James, the Lord’s brother.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Now about the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I’m not lying.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
  <verse number="22">I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,</verse>
  <verse number="23">but they only heard: “He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.”</verse>
  <verse number="24">And they glorified God in me.</verse>
