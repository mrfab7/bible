  <verse number="1">And I lifted up my eyes, and I saw, and behold, a man, and in his hand was a measuring line.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And I said, “Where are you going?” And he said to me, “To measure Jerusalem, so that I may see how great its width and how great its length may be.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">And behold, the angel, who had been speaking with me, departed, and another angel went out to meet him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he said to him: Hurry, speak to this young man, saying: Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls, because of the multitude of men and beasts of burden in its midst.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And I will be to it, says the Lord, a wall of fire all around. And in glory, I will be in its midst.</verse>
  <verse number="6">O, O flee from the land of the North, says the Lord, for I have scattered you into the four winds of heaven, says the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="7">O Zion, flee, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For thus says the Lord of hosts: After the glory, he has sent me to the Gentiles, which have despoiled you. For he who touches you, touches the pupil of my eye.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For behold, I lift up my hand over them, and they will be a prey to those who had served them. And you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Sing praise and rejoice, daughter of Zion. For behold, I approach, and I will dwell in your midst, says the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And many nations will be joined to the Lord in that day, and they will be my people, and I will dwell in your midst. And you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the Lord will possess his portion, Judah, in the sanctified land, and still he will single out Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Let all flesh be silent before the face of the Lord: for he has arisen from his holy dwelling place.</verse>
