  <verse number="1">Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend that you may know prudence.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I will give you a good gift, forsake not my law.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For I also was my father’s son, tender and as an only son in the sight of my mother:</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he taught me, and said: Let thy heart receive my words, keep my commandments, and thou shalt live.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Get wisdom, get prudence: forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Forsake her not, and she shall keep thee: love her, and she shall preserve thee.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The beginning of wisdom, get wisdom, and with all thy possession purchase prudence.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Take hold on her, and she shall exalt thee: thou shalt be glorified by her, when thou shalt embrace her.</verse>
  <verse number="9">She shall give to thy head increase of graces, and protect thee with a noble crown.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Hear, O my son, and receive my words, that years of life may be multiplied to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I will shew thee the way of wisdom, I will lead thee by the paths of equity:</verse>
  <verse number="12">Which when thou shalt have entered, thy steps shall not be straitened, and when thou runnest thou shalt not meet a stumblingblock.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Take hold on instruction, leave it not: keep it, because it is thy life.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Be not delighted in the paths of the wicked, neither let the way of evil men please thee.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Flee from it, pass not by it: go aside, and forsake it.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For they sleep not except they have done evil: and their sleep is taken away unless they have made some to fall.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But the path of the just, as a shining light, goeth forwards and increaseth even to perfect day.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The way of the wicked is darksome: they know not where they fall.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My son, hearken to my words, and incline thy ear to my sayings.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Let them not depart from thy eyes, keep them in the midst of thy heart:</verse>
  <verse number="22">For they are life to those that find them, and health to all flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="23">With all watchfulness keep thy heart, because life issueth out from it.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Remove from thee a froward mouth, and let detracting lips be far from thee.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Let thy eyes look straight on, and let thy eyelids go before thy steps.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Make straight the path for thy feet, and all thy ways shall be established.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Decline not to the right hand, nor to the left: turn away thy foot from evil. For the Lord knoweth the ways that are on the right hand: but those are perverse which are on the left hand. But he will make thy courses straight, he will bring forward thy ways in peace.</verse>
