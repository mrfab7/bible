<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="10" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and equity of Christ, who, in face truly low with you, but at a distance bold towards you:</verse>
  <verse number="2">And I pray, being present, not to be bold with the confidence which I reckon to encounter against certain, reckoning us as walking about according to the flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For walking in the flesh, we war not after the flesh:</verse>
  <verse number="4">(For the weapons of our warfare not fleshly, but powerful to God to the taking down of fortified places;)</verse>
  <verse number="5">Taking down reckonings, and every elevation lifted up against the knowledge of God, and taking captive every thought to the obedience of Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="6">And having in readiness to avenge every imperfect instruction, when your obedience should be completed.</verse>
  <verse number="7">See ye things according to the face? If any has persuaded himself to be of Christ, let him reckon this again of himself, that, as he of Christ, so we also of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For if I also boast something more abundantly of our power, which the Lord gave us for the building up, and not for your taking down, I shall not be ashamed:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Lest I seem as terrifying you by epistles.</verse>
  <verse number="10">(For truly the epistles, he says, weighty and strong; but the presence of the body weak, and the word counted as nothing.)</verse>
  <verse number="11">Let such a one reckon this, that, such as we are in the word by the epistles, being away, such also, being present, in deed.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For we dare not appear or join ourselves to certain of them recommending themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and joining themselves to themselves, do not understand.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And we boast not of things immeasurable, but according to the measure of the rule which the God of measure divided to us, to reach even also to you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For not as reaching to you we stretch beyond ourselves: for also even to you we came before in the good news of Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="15">Not boasting in things immeasurable, in the toils of others; and having hope, your faith being increased, to be enlarged in you according to our rule for abundance,</verse>
  <verse number="16">To announce the good hews in things beyond you, not in another’s rule to boast for things prepared.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But he boasting, let him boast in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For not he recommending himself, this is acceptable, but whom the Lord recommends.</verse>
