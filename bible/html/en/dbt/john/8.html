<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But Jesus went to the mount of Olives.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the scribes and the Pharisees bring [to him] a woman taken in adultery, and having set her in the midst,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">they say to him, Teacher, this woman has been taken in the very act, committing adultery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Now in the law Moses has commanded us to stone such; thou therefore, what sayest thou?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But this they said proving him, that they might have [something] to accuse him [of]. But Jesus, having stooped down, wrote with his finger on the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But when they continued asking him, he lifted himself up and said to them, Let him that is without sin among you first cast the stone at her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And again stooping down he wrote on the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But they, having heard [that], went out one by one beginning from the elder ones until the last; and Jesus was left alone and the woman standing there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Jesus, lifting himself up and seeing no one but the woman, said to her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? Has no one condemned thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And she said, No one, sir. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Again therefore Jesus spoke to them, saying, I am the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou bearest witness concerning thyself; thy witness is not true.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Jesus answered and said to them, Even if I bear witness concerning myself, my witness is true, because I know whence I came and whither I go: but ye know not whence I come and whither I go.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Ye judge according to the flesh, I judge no one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And if also I judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who has sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And in your law too it is written that the testimony of two men is true:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I am [one] who bear witness concerning myself, and the Father who has sent me bears witness concerning me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">They said to him therefore, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me nor my Father. If ye had known me, ye would have known also my Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">These words spoke he in the treasury, teaching in the temple; and no one took him, for his hour was not yet come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He said therefore again to them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin; where I go ye cannot come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he says, Where I go ye cannot come?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he said to them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above. Ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">I said therefore to you, that ye shall die in your sins; for unless ye shall believe that I am [he], ye shall die in your sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">They said therefore to him, Who art thou? [And] Jesus said to them, Altogether that which I also say to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I have many things to say and to judge concerning you, but he that has sent me is true, and I, what I have heard from him, these things I say to the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">They knew not that he spoke to them of the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Jesus therefore said to them, When ye shall have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I am [he], and [that] I do nothing of myself, but as the Father has taught me I speak these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And he that has sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, because I do always the things that are pleasing to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">As he spoke these things many believed on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Jesus therefore said to the Jews who believed him, If ye abide in my word, ye are truly my disciples;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">They answered him, We are Abraham’s seed, and have never been under bondage to any one; how sayest thou, Ye shall become free?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Every one that practises sin is the bondman of sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Now the bondman abides not in the house for ever: the son abides for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">If therefore the Son shall set you free, ye shall be really free.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word has no entrance in you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">I speak what I have seen with my Father, and ye then do what ye have seen with your father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus says to them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">but now ye seek to kill me, a man who has spoken the truth to you, which I have heard from God: this did not Abraham.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Ye do the works of your father. They said [therefore] to him, We are not born of fornication; we have one father, God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">Jesus said to them, If God were your father ye would have loved me, for I came forth from God and am come [from him]; for neither am I come of myself, but he has sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">Why do ye not know my speech? Because ye cannot hear my word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">Ye are of the devil, as [your] father, and ye desire to do the lusts of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks falsehood, he speaks of what is his own; for he is a liar and its father:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">and because I speak the truth, ye do not believe me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">Which of you convinces me of sin? If I speak truth, why do ye not believe me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">He that is of God hears the words of God: therefore ye hear [them] not, because ye are not of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">The Jews answered and said to him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan and hast a demon?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">But I do not seek my own glory: there is he that seeks and judges.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">Verily, verily, I say unto you, If any one shall keep my word, he shall never see death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">The Jews therefore said to him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham has died, and the prophets, and thou sayest, If any one keep my word, he shall never taste death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who has died? and the prophets have died: whom makest thou thyself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father who glorifies me, [of] whom ye say, He is our God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">And ye know him not; but I know him; and if I said, I know him not, I should be like you, a liar. But I know him, and I keep his word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">Your father Abraham exulted in that he should see my day, and he saw and rejoiced.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="57">The Jews therefore said to him, Thou hast not yet fifty years, and hast thou seen Abraham?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="58">Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="59">They took up therefore stones that they might cast [them] at him; but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple, [going through the midst of them, and thus passed on.]</p>
