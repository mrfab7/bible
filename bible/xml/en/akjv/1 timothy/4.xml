<chapter book="1 Timothy" number="4" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</verse>
  <verse number="2">Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</verse>
  <verse number="3">Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:</verse>
  <verse number="5">For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</verse>
  <verse number="6">If you put the brothers in remembrance of these things, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto you have attained.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise yourself rather to godliness.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For bodily exercise profits little: but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</verse>
  <verse number="9">This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For therefore we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, specially of those that believe.</verse>
  <verse number="11">These things command and teach.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Let no man despise your youth; but be you an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Neglect not the gift that is in you, which was given you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Meditate on these things; give yourself wholly to them; that your profiting may appear to all.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Take heed to yourself, and to the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this you shall both save yourself, and them that hear you.</verse>
