<div class="chapter" data-book="2 Timothy" data-chapter="2" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn’t crowned unless he has competed by the rules.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my Good News,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God’s word isn’t chained.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">This saying is faithful: “For if we died with him, we will also live with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he also will deny us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If we are faithless, he remains faithful. He can’t deny himself.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don’t argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">However God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal, “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared for every good work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive by him to his will.</p>
