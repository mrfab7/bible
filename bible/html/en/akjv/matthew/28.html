<p class="verse" data-verse="1">In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulcher.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat on it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the angel answered and said to the women, Fear not you: for I know that you seek Jesus, which was crucified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there shall you see him: see, I have told you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And they departed quickly from the sepulcher with fear and great joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and worshipped him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then said Jesus to them, Be not afraid: go tell my brothers that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and showed to the chief priests all the things that were done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave large money to the soldiers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Saying, Say you, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And if this come to the governorâ€™s ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you: and, see, I am with you always, even to the end of the world. Amen.</p>
