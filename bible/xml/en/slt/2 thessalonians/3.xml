  <verse number="1">As to the rest, pray, brethren, for us, that the word of the Lord may run, and be honoured, as also with you:</verse>
  <verse number="2">And that we may be delivered from unfit and evil men: for not faith of all.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But the Lord is faithful, who supports you, and will watch from the evil.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And we have had confidence in the Lord for you, that what we announce to you, and ye do and will do.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And we proclaim to you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, for you to shrink from every brother walking disorderly, and not according to the doctrine which he received of us.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For ye yourselves know that ye ought to imitate us: for we were not disorderly among you;</verse>
  <verse number="8">Neither ate we the bread of any as a gift; but in fatigue and toil working night and day also, not to overload any of you:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Not that we have not power, but that we give ourselves a type to you to imitate us.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For also when we were with you, this we proclaimed to you, that if any will not work, neither should he eat.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For we hear some walking disorderly among you, working nothing, but occupied unprofitably.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And to such we proclaim and beseech by our Lord Jesus Christ, that, with freedom from care working, they should eat their own bread.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And ye, brethren, lose not courage doing good.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And if any listen not to our word by the epistle, mark him, and mix not together with him, that he may change.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And deem not as an enemy, but remind as a brother.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the Lord of peace himself give to you peace for all in every manner. The Lord with you all.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The greeting of Paul with my hand, which is the sign in every epistle: so I write.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you all. Amen.</verse>
