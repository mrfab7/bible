<chapter book="Micah" number="6" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Hear you now what the LORD said; Arise, contend you before the mountains, and let the hills hear your voice.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hear you, O mountains, the LORD’s controversy, and you strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD has a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="3">O my people, what have I done to you? and wherein have I wearied you? testify against me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed you out of the house of servants; and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</verse>
  <verse number="5">O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim to Gilgal; that you may know the righteousness of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="6">With which shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</verse>
  <verse number="8">He has showed you, O man, what is good; and what does the LORD require of you, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God?</verse>
  <verse number="9">The LORD’s voice cries to the city, and the man of wisdom shall see your name: hear you the rod, and who has appointed it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?</verse>
  <verse number="12">For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Therefore also will I make you sick in smiting you, in making you desolate because of your sins.</verse>
  <verse number="14">You shall eat, but not be satisfied; and your casting down shall be in the middle of you; and you shall take hold, but shall not deliver; and that which you deliver will I give up to the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="15">You shall sow, but you shall not reap; you shall tread the olives, but you shall not anoint you with oil; and sweet wine, but shall not drink wine.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and you walk in their counsels; that I should make you a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore you shall bear the reproach of my people.</verse>
