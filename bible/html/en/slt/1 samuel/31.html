<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the rovers warred against Israel: and the men of Israel will flee from the face of the rovers, and they will fall wounded in mount Gilboa.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the rovers will stick fast to Saul and his sons; and the rovers will strike Jonathan and Abinadab and Melchisua, Saulâ€™s sons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the war will be heavy to Saul, and the archers, men with the bow, will find him; and he will be greatly wounded from the archers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Saul will say to him lifting up his arms, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised shall come and thrust me through and mock upon me. And he lifting up his arms would not, for he will fear greatly; and Saul will take the sword and will fall upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And he lifting up his arms will fear, for he saw Saul died; and he will fall, also he, upon his sword, and he will die with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Saul will die, and his three sons, and he lifting up his arms, also all his men in that day together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the men of Israel will see, who are on the the other side of the valley, and who are on the other side of Jordan, that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul died and his sons, and they will leave their cities, and flee; and the rovers will come and dwell in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And it will be on the morrow, and the rovers will come to strip the wounded, and they will find Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And they will cut off his head, and they will strip off his arms, and send into the land of the rovers round about, to announce good news to the house of their images and to the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And they will put up his arms in the house of Ashtaroth: and his body they will hang up upon the wall of the House of Quiet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead will hear concerning him what the rovers did to Saul,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And they will rise, every man of strength, and go all night and take the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the walls of the House of Quiet, and come to Jabesh, and burn them there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And they will take their bones and bury under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and they will fast seven days.</p>
