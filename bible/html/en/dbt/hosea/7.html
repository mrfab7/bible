<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When I would heal Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim is discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they practise falsehood; and the thief entereth in, [and] the troop of robbers assaileth without.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And they say not in their hearts [that] I remember all their wickedness: now do their own doings encompass them; they are before my face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They all practise adultery, as an oven heated by the baker: he ceaseth from stirring [the fire] after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">In the day of our king, the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine: he stretched out his hand to scorners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For they have applied their heart like an oven to their lying in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth like a flaming fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Ephraim, he mixeth himself with the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth [it] not; yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he knoweth [it] not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face; and they do not return to Jehovah their God, nor seek him for all this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Ephraim is become like a silly dove without understanding: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When they go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowl of the heavens; I will chastise them, according as their assembly hath heard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Woe unto them! for they have wandered from me; destruction unto them! for they have transgressed against me. And I would redeem them; but they speak lies against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And they cried not unto me in their heart, when they howled upon their beds; they assemble themselves for corn and new wine; they have turned aside from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I have indeed trained, I have strengthened their arms, but they imagine mischief against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">They return, [but] not to the [Most] High: they are like a deceitful bow. Their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</p>
