  <verse number="1">And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He sent messengers therefore to Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:</verse>
  <verse number="6">Come now therefore, I pray you, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he said to them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak to me: and the princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And God came to Balaam, and said, What men are these with you?</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="11">Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covers the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them; you shall not curse the people: for they are blessed.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuses to give me leave to go with you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuses to come with us.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus said Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray you, hinder you from coming to me:</verse>
  <verse number="17">For I will promote you to very great honor, and I will do whatever you say to me: come therefore, I pray you, curse me this people.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Now therefore, I pray you, tarry you also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say to me more.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men come to call you, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say to you, that shall you do.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his ass, and his two servants were with him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have smitten me these three times?</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Balaam said to the ass, Because you have mocked me: I would there were a sword in my hand, for now would I kill you.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And the ass said to Balaam, Am not I your ass, on which you have ridden ever since I was your to this day? was I ever wont to do so to you? And he said, No.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And the angel of the LORD said to him, Why have you smitten your ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand you, because your way is perverse before me:</verse>
  <verse number="33">And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain you, and saved her alive.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that you stood in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease you, I will get me back again.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him to a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not earnestly send to you to call you? why came you not to me? am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?</verse>
  <verse number="38">And Balaam said to Balak, See, I am come to you: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kirjathhuzoth.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that there he might see the utmost part of the people.</verse>
