<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="27" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Let another praise you, and not your own mouth—a stranger, and not your own lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A stone is heavy and sand is a burden, but aggravation from a fool outweighs them both.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Wrath is cruel and anger is like a flood, but who can withstand jealousy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Better an open rebuke than love that is concealed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The wounds of a friend are faithful, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The soul that is full loathes honey, but to a hungry soul, any bitter thing is sweet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Like a bird that strays from its nest is a man who wanders from his home.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Oil and incense bring joy to the heart, and the counsel of a friend is sweetness to the soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Do not forsake your friend or your father’s friend, and do not go to your brother’s house in the day of your calamity; better a neighbor nearby than a brother far away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart, so that I can answer him who taunts me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The prudent see danger and take cover, but the simple keep going and pay the penalty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Take the garment of him who posts security for a stranger; get collateral if it is for a foreigner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If one blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, it will be counted to him as a curse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">A constant dripping on a rainy day and a contentious woman are alike—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">restraining her is like holding back the wind or grasping oil with one’s right hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and he who looks after his master will be honored.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">As water reflects the face, so the heart reflects the true man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">A crucible for silver and a furnace for gold, but a man is tested by the praise accorded him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Though you grind a fool like grain with mortar and a pestle, yet his folly will not depart from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Be sure to know the state of your flocks, and pay close attention to your herds;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">for riches are not forever, nor does a crown endure to every generation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">When hay is removed and new growth appears and the grass from the hills is gathered,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">the lambs will provide you with clothing, and the goats with the price of a field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">You will have plenty of goats’ milk to feed you—food for your household and nourishment for your maidservants.</p>
