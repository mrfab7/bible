  <verse number="1">And it came to pass after these things, that God did prove Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham; and he said, Here am I.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come again to you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both of them together.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son: so they went both of them together.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be provided.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven,</verse>
  <verse number="16">and said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son:</verse>
  <verse number="17">that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;</verse>
  <verse number="18">and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.</verse>
  <verse number="19">So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto thy brother Nahor;</verse>
  <verse number="21">Uz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram;</verse>
  <verse number="22">and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abraham’s brother.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bare Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah.</verse>
