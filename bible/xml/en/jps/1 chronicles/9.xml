  <verse number="1">So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel; and Judah was carried away captive to Babylon because of their transgression.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in their cities were, Israelites, the priests, the Levites, and the Nethinim.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim and Manasseh:</verse>
  <verse number="4">Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of Perez the son of Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And of the Shilonites: Asaiah the first-born and his sons.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And of the sons of Zerah: Jeuel, and their brethren, six hundred and ninety.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And of the sons of Benjamin: Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hassenuah,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah the son of Uzzi, the son of Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephatiah, the son of Reuel, the son of Ibneiah;</verse>

  <verse number="17">And the porters: Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brother Shallum the chief;</verse>
  <verse number="18">who hitherto waited in the king’s gate eastward; they were the porters for the camp of the children of Levi.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of Korah, and his brethren, of his father’s house, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the Tent; and their fathers had been over the camp of the LORD, keepers of the entry;</verse>
  <verse number="20">and Phinehas the son of Eleazar was ruler over them in time past, the LORD being with him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of the tent of meeting.</verse>
  <verse number="22">All these that were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by genealogy in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set office.</verse>
  <verse number="23">So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of the LORD, even the house of the Tent, by wards.</verse>
  <verse number="24">On the four sides were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And their brethren, in their villages, were to come in every seven days from time to time to be with them;</verse>

  <verse number="27">And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge thereof was upon them, and to them pertained the opening thereof morning by morning.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And certain of them had charge of the vessels of service; for by tale were they brought in and by tale were they taken out.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Some of them also were appointed over the furniture, and over all the holy vessels, and over the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And some of the sons of the priests prepared the confection of the spices.</verse>
