<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Upon the first [day] of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as [God] hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by [your] letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and [there are] many adversaries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also [do].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">As touching [our] brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Let all your things be done with charity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and [that] they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with [us], and laboureth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The salutation of [me] Paul with mine own hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">My love [be] with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
