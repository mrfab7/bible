<chapter book="1 Samuel" number="16" translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" translationID="jps" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And the LORD said unto Samuel: ‘How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill thy horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Beth-lehemite; for I have provided Me a king among his sons.’</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Samuel said: ‘How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.’ And the LORD said: ‘Take a heifer with thee, and say: I am come to sacrifice to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will tell thee what thou shalt do; and thou shalt anoint unto Me him whom I name unto thee.’</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Samuel did that which the LORD spoke, and came to Beth-lehem. And the elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said: ‘Comest thou peaceably?’</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he said: ‘Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD; sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.’ And he sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And it came to pass, when they were come, that he beheld Eliab, and said: ‘Surely the LORD’S anointed is before Him.’</verse>
  <verse number="7">But the LORD said unto Samuel: ‘Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have rejected him; for it is not as man seeth: for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.’</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel. And he said: ‘Neither hath the LORD chosen this.’</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said: ‘Neither hath the LORD chosen this.’</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And Samuel said unto Jesse: ‘The LORD hath not chosen these.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Samuel said unto Jesse: ‘Are here all thy children?’ And he said: ‘There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep.’ And Samuel said unto Jesse: ‘Send and fetch him; for we will not sit down till he come hither.’</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of beautiful eyes, and goodly to look upon. And the LORD said: ‘Arise, anoint him; for this is he.’</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst of his brethren; and the spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to Ramah.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Now the spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the LORD terrified him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Saul’s servants said unto him: ‘Behold now, an evil spirit from God terrifieth thee.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Let our lord now command thy servants, that are before thee, to seek out a man who is a skilful player on the harp; and it shall be, when the evil spirit from God cometh upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well.’</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Saul said unto his servants: ‘Provide me now a man that can play well, and bring him to me.’</verse>
  <verse number="18">Then answered one of the young men, and said: ‘Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Beth-lehemite, that is skilful in playing, and a mighty man of valour, and a man of war, and prudent in affairs, and a comely person, and the LORD is with him.’</verse>
  <verse number="19">Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said: ‘Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep.’</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine, and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And David came to Saul, and stood before him; and he loved him greatly; and he became his armour-bearer.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Saul sent to Jesse, saying: ‘Let David, I pray thee, stand before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.’</verse>
  <verse number="23">And it came to pass, when the [evil] spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took the harp, and played with his hand; so Saul found relief, and it was well with him, and the evil spirit departed from him.</verse>
