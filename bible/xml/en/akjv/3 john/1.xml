<chapter book="3 John" number="1" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The elder to the well beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Beloved, I wish above all things that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For I rejoiced greatly, when the brothers came and testified of the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do to the brothers, and to strangers;</verse>
  <verse number="6">Which have borne witness of your charity before the church: whom if you bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, you shall do well:</verse>
  <verse number="7">Because that for his name’s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</verse>
  <verse number="8">We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellow helpers to the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I wrote to the church: but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, receives us not.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Why, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and forbids them that would, and casts them out of the church.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that does good is of God: but he that does evil has not seen God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Demetrius has good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yes, and we also bear record; and you know that our record is true.</verse>
  <verse number="13">I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write to you:</verse>
  <verse number="14">But I trust I shall shortly see you, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to you. Our friends salute you. Greet the friends by name.</verse>
