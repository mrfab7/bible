<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="22" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">This is the burden against the Valley of Vision: What ails you now, that you have all gone up to the rooftops,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">O city of commotion, O town of revelry? Your slain did not die by the sword, nor were they killed in battle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">All your rulers have fled together, captured without a bow. All your fugitives were captured together, having fled to a distant place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Therefore I said, “Turn away from me, let me weep bitterly! Do not try to console me over the destruction of the daughter of my people.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For the Lord GOD of Hosts has set a day of tumult and trampling and confusion in the Valley of Vision—of breaking down the walls and crying to the mountains.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Elam takes up a quiver, with chariots and horsemen, and Kir uncovers the shield.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Your choicest valleys are full of chariots, and horsemen are posted at the gates.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He has uncovered the defenses of Judah. On that day you looked to the weapons in the House of the Forest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">You saw that there were many breaches in the walls of the City of David. You collected water from the lower pool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">You counted the houses of Jerusalem and tore them down to strengthen the wall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">You built a reservoir between the walls for the waters of the ancient pool, but you did not look to the One who made it, or consider Him who planned it long ago.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">On that day the Lord GOD of Hosts called for weeping and wailing, for shaven heads and the wearing of sackcloth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But look, there is joy and gladness, butchering of cattle and slaughtering of sheep, eating of meat and drinking of wine: “Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The LORD of Hosts has revealed in my hearing: “Until your dying day, this sin of yours will never be atoned for,” says the Lord GOD of Hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">This is what the Lord GOD of Hosts says: “Go, say to Shebna, the steward in charge of the palace:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">What are you doing here, and who authorized you to carve out a tomb for yourself here—to chisel your tomb in the height and cut your resting place in the rock?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Look, O mighty man! The LORD is about to shake you violently. He will take hold of you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">roll you into a ball, and sling you into a wide land. There you will die, and there your glorious chariots will remain—a disgrace to the house of your master.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I will remove you from office, and you will be ousted from your position.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">On that day I will summon My servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">I will clothe him with your robe and tie your sash around him. I will put your authority in his hand, and he will be a father to the dwellers of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">I will place on his shoulder the key to the house of David. What he opens no one can shut, and what he shuts no one can open.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">I will drive him like a peg into a firm place, and he will be a throne of glory for the house of his father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">So they will hang on him all the glory of his father’s house: the descendants and the offshoots—all the lesser vessels, from bowls to every kind of jar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">In that day, declares the LORD of Hosts, the peg driven into a firm place will give way; it will be sheared off and fall, and the load upon it will be cut down.” Indeed, the LORD has spoken.</p>
