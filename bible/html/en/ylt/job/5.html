<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Pray, call, is there any to answer thee? And unto which of the holy ones dost thou turn?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For provocation slayeth the perverse, And envy putteth to death the simple,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I—I have seen the perverse taking root, And I mark his habitation straightway,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Far are his sons from safety, And they are bruised in the gate, And there is no deliverer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Whose harvest the hungry doth eat, And even from the thorns taketh it, And the designing swallowed their wealth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For sorrow cometh not forth from the dust, Nor from the ground springeth up misery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For man to misery is born, And the sparks go high to fly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Yet I—I inquire for God, And for God I give my word,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Doing great things, and there is no searching. Wonderful, till there is no numbering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who is giving rain on the face of the land, And is sending waters on the out-places.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">To set the low on a high place, And the mourners have been high in safety.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Making void thoughts of the subtile, And their hands do not execute wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Capturing the wise in their subtilty, And the counsel of wrestling ones was hastened,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">By day they meet darkness, And as night—they grope at noon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And He saveth the wasted from their mouth, And from a strong hand the needy,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And there is hope to the poor, And perverseness hath shut her mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Lo, the happiness of mortal man, God doth reprove him: And the chastisement of the Mighty despise not,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For He doth pain, and He bindeth up, He smiteth, and His hands heal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">In six distresses He delivereth thee, And in seven evil striketh not on thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In famine He hath redeemed thee from death, And in battle from the hands of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">When the tongue scourgeth thou art hid, And thou art not afraid of destruction, When it cometh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">At destruction and at hunger thou mockest, And of the beast of the earth, Thou art not afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">(For with sons of the field is thy covenant, And the beast of the field Hath been at peace with thee.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And thou hast known that thy tent is peace, And inspected thy habitation, and errest not,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And hast known that numerous is Thy seed, And thine offspring as the herb of the earth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Thou comest in full age unto the grave, As the going up of a stalk in its season.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Lo, this—we searched it out—it is right, hearken; And thou, know for thyself!</p>
