<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My spirit will be wasted, my days will be shortened, and only the grave will left for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I have not sinned, yet my eye remains in bitterness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Free me, O Lord, and set me beside you, and let the hand of anyone you wish fight against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">You have set their heart far from discipline; therefore, they will not be praised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He promises prey to his companions, but the eyes of his sons will grow faint.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He has posted me like a proverb to the people, and I am an example in their presence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">My eyesight has been clouded by indignation, and my limbs have been reduced, as if to nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The just will be astounded over this, and the innocent will be stirred up against the hypocrite.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the just will cling to his way, and clean hands will increase strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore, be converted, all of you, and approach, for I do not find in you any wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My days have passed away; my thoughts have been scattered, tormenting my heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They have turned night into day, and I hope for light again after the darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I should wait, the underworld is my house, and in darkness I have spread out my bed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I have said to decay and to worms: “You are my father, my mother, and my sister.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Therefore, where is my expectation now, and who is it that considers my patience?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Everything of mine will descend into the deepest underworld; do you think that, in that place at least, there will be rest for me?</p>
