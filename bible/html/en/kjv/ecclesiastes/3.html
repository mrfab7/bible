<p class="verse" data-verse="1">To every [thing there is] a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up [that which is] planted;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He hath made every [thing] beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I know that [there is] no good in them, but for [a man] to rejoice, and to do good in his life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it [is] the gift of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth [it], that [men] should fear before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, [that] wickedness [was] there; and the place of righteousness, [that] iniquity [was] there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for [there is] a time there for every purpose and for every work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all [is] vanity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Wherefore I perceive that [there is] nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that [is] his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</p>
