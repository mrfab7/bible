<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="10" translation="Webster Bible Translation" translationID="wbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now I Paul myself beseech you, by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold towards you:</verse>
  <verse number="2">But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, with which I think to be bold against some, who think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh:</verse>
  <verse number="4">(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)</verse>
  <verse number="5">Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="6">And having in a readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trusteth to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ’s, even so are we Christ’s.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:</verse>
  <verse number="9">That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For his letters (say they) are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Let such one think this, that such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even to you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not to you; for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="15">Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men’s labors; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you, according to our rule abundantly,</verse>
  <verse number="16">To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man’s line of things made ready to our hand.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.</verse>
