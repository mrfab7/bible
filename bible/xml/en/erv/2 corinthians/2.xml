<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="2" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you with sorrow.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For if I make you sorry, who then is he that maketh me glad, but he that is made sorry by me?</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I wrote this very thing, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be made sorry, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But if any hath caused sorrow, he hath caused sorrow, not to me, but in part (that I press not too heavily) to you all.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many;</verse>
  <verse number="7">so that contrariwise ye should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest by any means such a one should be swallowed up with his overmuch sorrow.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Wherefore I beseech you to confirm your love toward him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But to whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for what I also have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, for your sakes have I forgiven it in the person of Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="11">that no advantage may be gained over us by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and when a door was opened unto me in the Lord,</verse>
  <verse number="13">I had no relief for my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But thanks be unto God, which always leadeth us in triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest through us the savour of his knowledge in every place.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For we are a sweet savour of Christ unto God, in them that are being saved, and in them that are perishing;</verse>
  <verse number="16">to the one a savour from death unto death; to the other a savour from life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?</verse>
  <verse number="17">For we are not as the many, corrupting the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ.</verse>
