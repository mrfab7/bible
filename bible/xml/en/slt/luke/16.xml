  <verse number="1">And he said to his disciples, A certain man was rich, who had a steward; and he was slandered to him as dispersing his goods.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And having called him, he said to him, What is this I hear of thee give back the word of thy stewardship; for thou canst no more be steward.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the steward said in himself, What shall I do? for my lord takes away the stewardship from me: I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I have resolved what I will do, that, when I should be removed from the stewardship, they might receive me in their houses.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And having called upon each one of his lord’s debtors, he said to the first, How much owest thou to my lord.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he said, An hundred baths of oil. And he said to him, Take thou thy book, and having quickly sat down, write fifty.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then said he to another, How much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said to him, Take thy book, and write eighty.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the Lord praised the steward of injustice, because he did wisely: for the sons of this life are wiser than the children of light in their generation.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And I say to you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of injustice; that, when ye fail, they might receive you into lasting tents.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He faithful in the least, is also faithful in much: and he unjust in the least, is also unjust in much.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If therefore ye were not faithful in the unjust mammon, who shall trust to you the true?</verse>
  <verse number="12">And if ye were not faithful with another, who shall give you your own?</verse>
  <verse number="13">No servant can serve two lords: for he will either hate one, and love the other; or he will hold firmly to one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the Pharisees heard all these things, being avaricious: and they derided him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he said to them, Ye are they justifying yourselves before men; and God knows your hearts: for the high with men is abomination before God.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The law and the prophets until John: from then the kingdom of God announces good news, and every one is forced into it.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass away, than for one horn of the law to fall.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Every one loosing his wife, and marrying another, commits adultery: and every one marrying her having been loosed from the husband commits adultery.</verse>
  <verse number="19">A certain man was rich, and was clothed in purple and fine linen, being daily splendidly gladdened:</verse>
  <verse number="20">And there was a certain beggar, Lazarus by name, who was cast at his gate, having been wounded,</verse>
  <verse number="21">And eagerly desirous to be fed from crumbs falling from the rich one’s table: but also the dogs, coming, licked off his wounds.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And it was, the beggar died, and was carried by messengers into Abraham’s bosom: and the rich one died also, and was buried;</verse>
  <verse number="23">And in hades, having lifted up his eyes, being in torments, he sees Abraham from far off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And he having called out, said, Father Abraham, pity me, and send Lazarus, that he might dip his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But Abraham said, Child, remember that thou didst receive thy good things in thy life, and Lazarus likewise evil things: and now here is he comforted, and thou art tormented.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And besides all these, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed: so that they wishing to pass through thence to you could not; neither could they cross over from thence to us.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he said, Then I ask thee, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father’s house:</verse>
  <verse number="28">For I have five brethren; that he might testify to them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Abraham says to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if some one from the dead go to them, they will change the mind.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither if any rise from the dead, will they be persueded.</verse>
