  <verse number="1">Then the LORD said to Moses,</verse>
  <verse number="2">“On the first day of the first month you are to set up the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Put the ark of the Testimony in it and screen off the ark with the veil.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then bring in the table and set out its arrangement; bring in the lampstand as well, and set up its lamps.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Place the gold altar of incense in front of the ark of the Testimony, and hang the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Place the altar of burnt offering in front of the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And place the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water in it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Set up the surrounding courtyard and hang the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and everything in it; consecrate it along with all its furnishings, and it shall be holy.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils; consecrate the altar, and it shall be most holy.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Anoint the basin and its stand and consecrate them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Then bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance to the Tent of Meeting and wash them with water.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And you are to clothe Aaron with the holy garments, anoint him, and consecrate him, so that he may serve Me as a priest.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Bring his sons forward and clothe them with tunics.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Anoint them just as you anointed their father, so that they may also serve Me as priests. Their anointing will qualify them for a permanent priesthood throughout their generations.”</verse>
  <verse number="16">Moses did everything just as the LORD had commanded him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">So the tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month of the second year.</verse>
  <verse number="18">When Moses set up the tabernacle, he laid its bases, positioned its frames, inserted its crossbars, and set up its posts.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering over the tent, just as the LORD had commanded him.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Moses took the Testimony and placed it in the ark, attaching the poles to the ark; and he set the mercy seat atop the ark.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then he brought the ark into the tabernacle, put up the veil for the screen, and shielded off the ark of the Testimony, just as the LORD had commanded him.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Moses placed the table in the Tent of Meeting on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He arranged the bread on it before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded him.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He also placed the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle</verse>
  <verse number="25">and set up the lamps before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded him.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Moses placed the gold altar in the Tent of Meeting, in front of the veil,</verse>
  <verse number="27">and he burned fragrant incense on it, just as the LORD had commanded him.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then he put up the curtain at the entrance to the tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="29">He placed the altar of burnt offering near the entrance to the tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the grain offering, just as the LORD had commanded him.</verse>
  <verse number="30">He placed the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing;</verse>
  <verse number="31">and from it Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet.</verse>
  <verse number="32">They washed whenever they entered the Tent of Meeting or approached the altar, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And Moses set up the courtyard around the tabernacle and the altar, and he hung the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard. So Moses finished the work.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Then the cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Moses was unable to enter the Tent of Meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Whenever the cloud was lifted from above the tabernacle, the Israelites would set out through all the stages of their journey.</verse>
  <verse number="37">If the cloud was not lifted, they would not set out until the day it was taken up.</verse>
  <verse number="38">For the cloud of the LORD was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel through all their journeys.</verse>
