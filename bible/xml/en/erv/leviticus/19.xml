  <verse number="1">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and ye shall keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And when ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it that ye may be accepted.</verse>
  <verse number="6">It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if aught remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination; it shall not be accepted:</verse>
  <verse number="8">but every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the holy thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from his people.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the fallen fruit of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and for the stranger: I am the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Ye shall not steal; neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, so that thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.</verse>

  <verse number="14">Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but thou shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbour, and not bear sin because of him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed: neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; they shall be punished; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he shall bring his guilt offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a guilt offering.</verse>

  <verse number="23">And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as their uncircumcision: three years shall they be as uncircumcised unto you; it shall not be eaten.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy, for giving praise unto the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantments, nor practise augury.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Profane not thy daughter, to make her a harlot; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Turn ye not unto them that have familiar spirits, nor unto the wizards; seek them not out, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.</verse>

  <verse number="34">The stranger that sojourneth with you shall be unto you as the homeborn among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And ye shall observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.</verse>
