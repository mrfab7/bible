  <verse number="2">Again thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his seed to Molech, he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed to Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed to Molech, and kill him not;</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go astray after him, to commit lewdness with Molech from among their people.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go astray after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.</verse>

  <verse number="23">And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nations which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But I have said to you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it to you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, who have separated you from other people.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Ye shall therefore distinguish between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your souls abominable by beast or by fowl, or by any manner of living animal that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean.</verse>
