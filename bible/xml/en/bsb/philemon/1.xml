<chapter book="Philemon" number="1" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved fellow worker,</verse>
  <verse number="2">to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church that meets at your house:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I always thank my God, remembering you in my prayers,</verse>
  <verse number="5">because I hear about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I pray that your partnership in the faith may become effective as you fully acknowledge every good thing that is ours in Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I take great joy and encouragement in your love, because you, brother, have refreshed the hearts of the saints.</verse>
  <verse number="8">So although in Christ I am bold enough to order you to do what is proper,</verse>
  <verse number="9">I prefer to appeal on the basis of love. For I, Paul, am now aged, and a prisoner of Christ Jesus as well.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I appeal to you for my child Onesimus, whose father I became while I was in chains.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Formerly he was useless to you, but now he has become useful both to you and to me.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I am sending back to you him who is my very heart.</verse>
  <verse number="13">I would have liked to keep him with me, so that on your behalf he could minister to me in my chains for the gospel.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your goodness will not be out of compulsion, but by your own free will.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a while, so that you might have him back for good—</verse>
  <verse number="16">no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a beloved brother. He is especially beloved to me, but even more so to you, both in person and in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="17">So if you consider me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But if he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to my account.</verse>
  <verse number="19">I, Paul, write this with my own hand. I will repay it—not to mention that you owe me your very self.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Yes, brother, let me have some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I ask.</verse>
  <verse number="22">In the meantime, prepare a guest room for me, because I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends you greetings,</verse>
  <verse number="24">as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</verse>
