<chapter book="1 John" number="1" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our own eyes, which we have gazed upon and touched with our own hands—this is the Word of life.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And this is the life that was revealed; we have seen it and testified to it, and we proclaim to you the eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us.</verse>
  <verse number="3">We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have fellowship with us. And this fellowship of ours is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="4">We write these things so that our joy may be complete.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And this is the message we have heard from Him and announce to you: God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.</verse>
  <verse number="6">If we say we have fellowship with Him yet walk in the darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.</verse>
  <verse number="8">If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</verse>
  <verse number="9">If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If we say we have not sinned, we make Him out to be a liar, and His word is not in us.</verse>
