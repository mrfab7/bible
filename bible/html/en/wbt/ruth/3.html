<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to-night in the threshing-floor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and go down to the floor: but make not thyself known to the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And it shall be when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And she said to her, All that thou sayest to me I will do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And she went down to the floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And when Boaz had eaten and drank, and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid herself down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself: and behold, a woman lay at his feet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thy handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid; for thou art a near kinsman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou hast shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou didst not follow young men, whether poor or rich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a virtuous woman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: yet there is a kinsman nearer than I.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will perform to thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsmanâ€™s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman came to the floor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who art thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And she said, These six measures of barley he gave me; for he said to me, Go not empty to thy mother-in-law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou knowest how the matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he hath finished the thing this day.</p>
