<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The burden of Moab. For in the night that Ar of Moab is laid waste, He is brought to ruin; For in the night that Kir of Moab is laid waste, He is brought to ruin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">He is gone up to Baith, and to Dibon, To the high places, to weep; Upon Nebo, and upon Medeba, Moab howleth; On all their heads is baldness, Every beard is shaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">In their streets they gird themselves with sackcloth; On their housetops, and in their broad places, Every one howleth, weeping profusely.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Heshbon crieth out, and Elealeh; Their voice is heard even unto Jahaz; Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; His soul is faint within him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">My heart crieth out for Moab; Her fugitives reach unto Zoar, A heifer of three years old; For by the ascent of Luhith With weeping they go up; For in the way of Horonaim They raise up a cry of destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For the Waters of Nimrim shall be desolate; For the grass is withered away, the herbage faileth, There is no green thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Therefore the abundance they have gotten, And that which they have laid up, Shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For the cry is gone round about The borders of Moab; The howling thereof unto Eglaim, And the howling thereof unto Beer-elim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; For I will bring yet more upon Dimon, A lion upon him that escapeth of Moab, And upon the remnant of the land.</p>
