  <verse number="1">And David is old, and satisfied with days, and causeth his son Solomon to reign over Israel,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and gathereth all the heads of Israel, and the priests, and the Levites;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and the Levites are numbered from a son of thirty years and upward, and their number, by their polls, is of mighty men thirty and eight thousand.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Of these to preside over the work of the house of Jehovah are twenty and four thousand, and officers and judges six thousand,</verse>
  <verse number="5">and four thousand gatekeepers, and four thousand giving praise to Jehovah, ‘with instruments that I made for praising,’ saith David.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And David distributeth them into courses: Of the sons of Levi: of Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Of the Gershonite: Laadan and Shimei.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Sons of Laadan: the head is Jehiel, and Zetham, and Joel, three.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Sons of Shimei are Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three; these are heads of the fathers of Laadan.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And sons of Shimei are Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and Beriah; these are sons of Shimei, four.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Jahath is the head, and Zizah the second, and Jeush and Beriah have not multiplied sons, and they become the house of a father by one numbering.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Sons of Kohath are Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses; and Aaron is separated for his sanctifying the holy of holies, he and his sons—unto the age, to make perfume before Jehovah, to serve Him, and to bless in His name—unto the age.</verse>
  <verse number="14">As to Moses, the man of God, his sons are called after the tribe of Levi.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Sons of Gershom: Shebuel the head.</verse>

  <verse number="23">Sons of Mushi: Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth, three.</verse>
  <verse number="24">These are sons of Levi, by the house of their fathers, heads of the fathers, by their appointments, in the number of names, by their polls, doing the work for the service of the house of Jehovah, from a son of twenty years and upward,</verse>
  <verse number="25">for David said, ‘Jehovah, God of Israel, hath given rest to His people, and He doth tabernacle in Jerusalem unto the age;’</verse>
  <verse number="26">and also of the Levites, ‘None are to bear the tabernacle and all its vessels for its service;’</verse>
  <verse number="27">for by the last words of David they took the number of the sons of Levi from a son of twenty years and upward,</verse>
  <verse number="28">for their station is at the side of the sons of Aaron, for the service of the house of Jehovah, over the courts, and over the chambers, and over the cleansing of every holy thing, and the work of the service of the house of God,</verse>
  <verse number="29">and for the bread of the arrangement, and for fine flour for present, and for the thin unleavened cakes, and for the work of the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all liquid measure and solid measure;</verse>
  <verse number="30">and to stand, morning by morning, to give thanks, and to give praise to Jehovah, and so at evening;</verse>
  <verse number="31">and for all the burnt-offerings—burnt-offerings to Jehovah for sabbaths, for new moons, and for appointed seasons, by number, according to the ordinance upon them continually, before Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And they have kept the charge of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the sons of Aaron, their brethren, for the service of the house of Jehovah.</verse>
