<chapter book="Hebrews" number="11" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now, faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not apparent.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For this reason, the ancients were given testimony.</verse>
  <verse number="3">By faith, we understand the world to be fashioned by the Word of God, so that the visible might be made by the invisible.</verse>
  <verse number="4">By faith, Abel offered to God a much better sacrifice than that of Cain, through which he obtained testimony that he was just, in that God offered testimony to his gifts. And through that sacrifice, he still speaks to us, though he is dead.</verse>
  <verse number="5">By faith, Enoch was transferred, so that he would not see death, and he was not found because God had transferred him. For before he was transferred, he had testimony that he pleased God.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But without faith, it is impossible to please God. For whoever approaches God must believe that he exists, and that he rewards those who seek him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">By faith, Noah, having accepted an answer about those things which were not yet seen, being afraid, fashioned an ark for the salvation of his house. Through the ark, he condemned the world, and was established as the heir of the justice that occurs through faith.</verse>
  <verse number="8">By faith, the one called Abraham obeyed, going out to the place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going.</verse>
  <verse number="9">By faith, he stayed in the Land of the Promise as if in a foreign land, dwelling in cottages, with Isaac and Jacob, co-heirs of the same promise.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For he was awaiting a city having firm foundations, whose designer and builder is God.</verse>
  <verse number="11">By faith also, Sarah herself, being barren, received the ability to conceive offspring, even though she was past that age in life. For she believed him to be faithful, who had promised.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Because of this, there were also born, from one who himself was as if dead, a mulititude like the stars of heaven, who are, like the sand of the seashore, innumerable.</verse>
  <verse number="13">All of these passed away, adhering to faith, not having received the promises, yet beholding them from afar and saluting them, and confessing themselves to be sojourners and guests upon the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For those who speak in this way are themselves indicating that they seek a homeland.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And if, indeed, they had been mindful of the very place from which they departed, they certainly would have returned in time.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But now they hunger for a better place, that is, Heaven. For this reason, God is not ashamed to be called their God. For he has prepared a city for them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">By faith, Abraham, when he was tested, offered Isaac, so that he who had received the promises was offering up his only son.</verse>
  <verse number="18">To him, it was said, “Through Isaac, shall your offspring be summoned,”</verse>
  <verse number="19">indicating that God is even able to raise up from the dead. And thus, he also established him as a parable.</verse>
  <verse number="20">By faith, also, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, concerning future events.</verse>
  <verse number="21">By faith, Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph; and he reverenced the summit of his rod.</verse>
  <verse number="22">By faith, Joseph, as he was dying, recalled the departure of the sons of Israel, and gave a commandment concerning his bones.</verse>
  <verse number="23">By faith, Moses, after being born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they had seen that he was a graceful infant, and they did not fear the king’s edict.</verse>
  <verse number="24">By faith, Moses, after growing up, denied himself a place as the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,</verse>
  <verse number="25">choosing to be afflicted with the people of God, rather than to have the pleasantness of sin for a time,</verse>
  <verse number="26">valuing the reproach of Christ to be a greater wealth than the treasures of the Egyptians. For he looked forward to his reward.</verse>
  <verse number="27">By faith, he abandoned Egypt, not dreading the animosity of the king. For he pressed on, as if seeing him who is unseen.</verse>
  <verse number="28">By faith, he celebrated the Passover and the shedding of the blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn might not touch them.</verse>
  <verse number="29">By faith, they crossed the Red Sea, as if on dry land, yet when the Egyptians attempted it, they were swallowed up.</verse>
  <verse number="30">By faith, the walls of Jericho collapsed, after being encircled for seven days.</verse>
  <verse number="31">By faith, Rahab, the harlot, did not perish with the unbelievers, after receiving the spies with peace.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And what should I say next? For time is not sufficient for me to give an account of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the Prophets:</verse>
  <verse number="33">those who, by faith, conquered kingdoms, accomplished justice, obtained promises, closed the mouths of lions,</verse>
  <verse number="34">extinguished the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, recovered from infirmities, showed strength in battle, turned back the armies of foreigners.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Women received their dead by means of resurrection. But others suffered severe punishment, not yet receiving redemption, so that they would find a better resurrection.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Truly, others were tested by mocking and lashes, and moreover by chains and imprisonment.</verse>
  <verse number="37">They were stoned; they were cut; they were tempted. With the slaughter of the sword, they were killed. They wandered about in sheepskin and in goatskin, in dire need, in anguish afflicted.</verse>
  <verse number="38">Of them, the world was not worthy, wandering in solitude on mountains, in the caves and caverns of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And all these, having been proven by the testimony of faith, did not receive the Promise.</verse>
  <verse number="40">God’s Providence holds something better for us, so that not without us would they be perfected.</verse>
