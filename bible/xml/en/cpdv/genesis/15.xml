  <verse number="1">And so, these things having been transacted, the word of the Lord came to Abram by a vision, saying: “Do not be afraid, Abram, I am your protector, and your reward is exceedingly great.”</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Abram said: “Lord God, what will you give to me? I may go without children. And the son of the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Abram added: “Yet to me you have not given offspring. And behold, my servant born in my house will be my heir.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">And immediately the word of the Lord came to him, saying: “This one will not be your heir. But he who will come from your loins, the same will you have for your heir.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he brought him outside, and he said to him, “Take in the heavens, and number the stars, if you can.” And he said to him, “So also will your offspring be.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">Abram believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he said to him, “I am the Lord who led you away from Ur of the Chaldeans, so as to give you this land, and so that you would possess it.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">But he said, “Lord God, in what way may I be able to know that I will possess it?”</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the Lord responded by saying: “Take for me a cow of three years, and a she-goat of three years, and a ram of three years, also a turtle-dove and a pigeon.”</verse>
  <verse number="10">Taking all these, he divided them through the middle, and placed both parts opposite one another. But the birds he did not divide.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And birds descended upon the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And when the sun was setting, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a dread, great and dark, invaded him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And it was said to him: “Know beforehand that your future offspring will be sojourners in a land not their own, and they will subjugate them in servitude and afflict them for four hundred years.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Yet truly, I will judge the nation that they will serve, and after this they will depart with great substance.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But you will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a good old age.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But in the fourth generation, they will return here. For the iniquities of the Amorites are not yet completed, even to this present time.”</verse>
  <verse number="17">Then, when the sun had set, there came a dark mist, and there appeared a smoking furnace and a lamp of fire passing between those divisions.</verse>
  <verse number="18">On that day, God formed a covenant with Abram, saying: “To your offspring I will give this land, from the river of Egypt, even to the great river Euphrates:</verse>
  <verse number="19">the land of the Kenites and the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites</verse>
  <verse number="20">and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, likewise the Rephaim,</verse>
  <verse number="21">and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites</verse>
