<p class="verse" data-verse="1">We may fear, then, lest a promise being left of entering into His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">for we also are having good news proclaimed, even as they, but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">for we do enter into the rest—we who did believe, as He said, ‘So I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest—;’ and yet the works were done from the foundation of the world,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">for He spake in a certain place concerning the seventh day thus: ‘And God did rest in the seventh day from all His works;’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and in this place again, ‘If they shall enter into My rest—;’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">since then, it remaineth for certain to enter into it, and those who did first hear good news entered not in because of unbelief—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">again He doth limit a certain day, ‘To-day,’ (in David saying, after so long a time,) as it hath been said, ‘To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts,’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">for if Joshua had given them rest, He would not concerning another day have spoken after these things;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">there doth remain, then, a sabbatic rest to the people of God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">for he who did enter into his rest, he also rested from his works, as God from His own.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">May we be diligent, then, to enter into that rest, that no one in the same example of the unbelief may fall,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">for the reckoning of God is living, and working, and sharp above every two-edged sword, and piercing unto the dividing asunder both of soul and spirit, of joints also and marrow, and a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and there is not a created thing not manifest before Him, but all things are naked and open to His eyes—with whom is our reckoning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Having, then, a great chief priest passed through the heavens—Jesus the Son of God—may we hold fast the profession,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">for we have not a chief priest unable to sympathise with our infirmities, but one tempted in all things in like manner—apart from sin;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">we may come near, then, with freedom, to the throne of the grace, that we may receive kindness, and find grace—for seasonable help.</p>
