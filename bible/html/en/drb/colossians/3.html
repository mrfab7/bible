<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Therefore, if you be risen with Christ, seek the things that are above; where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Mind the things that are above, not the things that are upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For you are dead; and your life is hid with Christ in God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">When Christ shall appear, who is your life, then you also shall appear with him in glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, lust, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is the service of idols.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For which things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of unbelief,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In which you also walked some time, when you lived in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But now put you also all away: anger, indignation, malice, blasphemy, filthy speech out of your mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Lie not one to another: stripping yourselves of the old man with his deeds,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And putting on the new, him who is renewed unto knowledge, according to the image of him that created him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Where there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free. But Christ is all, and in all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Put ye on therefore, as the elect of God, holy, and beloved, the bowels of mercy, benignity, humility, modesty, patience:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if any have a complaint against another: even as the Lord hath forgiven you, so do you also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But above all these things have charity, which is the bond of perfection:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And let the peace of Christ rejoice in your hearts, wherein also you are called in one body: and be ye thankful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let the word of Christ dwell in you abundantly, in all wisdom: teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual canticles, singing in grace in your hearts to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">All whatsoever you do in word or in work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Wives, be subject to your husbands, as it behoveth in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter towards them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing to the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Fathers, provoke not your children to indignation, lest they be discouraged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not serving to the eye, as pleasing men, but in simplicity of heart, fearing God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Whatsoever you do, do it from the heart, as to the Lord, and not to men:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Knowing that you shall receive of the Lord the reward of inheritance. Serve ye the Lord Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For he that doth wrong, shall receive for that which he hath done wrongfully: and there is no respect of persons with God.</p>
