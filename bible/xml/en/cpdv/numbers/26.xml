  <verse number="2">“Number the entire sum of the sons of Israel, from twenty years and above, by their houses and kinships, all who are able to go forth to war.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">And so, Moses and Eleazar the priest, who were in the plains of Moab, above the Jordan, opposite Jericho, spoke to those who were</verse>

  <verse number="10">And the earth, opening its mouth, devoured Korah, with many others dying, when the fire burned two hundred fifty men. And a great miracle was wrought,</verse>

  <verse number="55">Yet only in so far as the land is divided by lot to a tribe and to families.</verse>
