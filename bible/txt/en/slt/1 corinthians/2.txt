1	And I having come to you, brethren, came not with eminence of word or of wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God.
2	For I judged not to know any thing among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.
3	And I, in weakness, and in fear, and in much tremor, was with you.
4	And my word and my proclaiming not in persuasible words of man’s wisdom, but in manifestation of the Spirit and of power.
5	That your faith might not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
6	But we speak wisdom among the perfected: and the wisdom not of this life, nor of the rulers of this life, they being left unemployed:
7	But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, hidden, which God determined beforehand, before the times to our glory:
8	Which none of the rulers of this world knew: for if they had known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
9	But as has been written. Which the eye saw not, and the ear heard not, and upon the heart of man it came not up, what things God has prepared for them loving him.
10	And God has revealed to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, and the deep things of God.
11	For who of men knows the things of men except the spirit of man in him? so also the things of God no one knows, except the Spirit of God.
12	And we have not received the spirit of the world, but the spirit from God; that we might know things bestowed upon us as a gift by God.
13	Which also we speak, not in words taught of man’s wisdom, but in them taught of the Holy Spirit; examining spiritual things by spiritual.
14	And the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: and he cannot know, for they are spiritually examined.
15	And the spiritual truly examines all things, and he is examined by no one.
16	For who knew the mind of the Lord, who shall instruct him And we have the mind of Christ.
