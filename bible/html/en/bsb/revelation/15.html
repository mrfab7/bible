<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then I saw another great and marvelous sign in heaven: seven angels with the seven final plagues, with which the wrath of God is completed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, beside which stood those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name. They were holding harps from God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and they sang the song of God’s servant Moses and of the Lamb: “Great and wonderful are Your works, O Lord God Almighty! Just and true are Your ways, O King of the nations!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who will not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy. All nations will come and worship before You, for Your righteous acts have been revealed.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">After this I looked, and the temple—the tabernacle of the Testimony—was opened in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues, dressed in clean and bright linen and girded with golden sashes around their chests.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power; and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.</p>
