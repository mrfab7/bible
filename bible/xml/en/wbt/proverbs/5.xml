<chapter book="Proverbs" number="5" translation="Webster Bible Translation" translationID="wbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My son, attend to my wisdom, and bow thy ear to my understanding:</verse>
  <verse number="2">That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the lips of a strange woman drop as a honey-comb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:</verse>
  <verse number="4">But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Lest thou shouldst ponder the path of life, her ways are movable, that thou canst not know them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Lest thou give thy honor to others, and thy years to the cruel:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labors be in the house of a stranger;</verse>
  <verse number="11">And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</verse>
  <verse number="12">And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</verse>
  <verse number="13">And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to them that instructed me!</verse>
  <verse number="14">I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Drink waters out of thy own cistern, and running waters out of thy own well.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Let them be only thy own, and not for strangers with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</verse>
  <verse number="21">For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.</verse>
  <verse number="22">His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be held with the cords of his sins.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</verse>
