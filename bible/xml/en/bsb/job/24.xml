<chapter book="Job" number="24" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">“Why does the Almighty not reserve times for judgment? Why may those who know Him never see His days?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Men move boundary stones; they pasture stolen flocks.</verse>
  <verse number="3">They drive away the donkey of the fatherless and take the widow’s ox in pledge.</verse>
  <verse number="4">They push the needy off the road and force all the poor of the land into hiding.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Indeed, like wild donkeys in the desert, the poor go to work foraging for food; the wasteland is food for their children.</verse>
  <verse number="6">They gather fodder in the fields and glean the vineyards of the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Without clothing, they spend the night naked; they have no covering against the cold.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Drenched by mountain rains, they huddle against the rocks for want of shelter.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The fatherless infant is snatched from the breast; the nursing child of the poor is seized for a debt.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Without clothing, they wander about naked. They carry the sheaves, but still go hungry.</verse>
  <verse number="11">They crush olives within their walls; they tread the winepresses, but go thirsty.</verse>
  <verse number="12">From the city, men groan, and the souls of the wounded cry out, yet God charges no one with wrongdoing.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then there are those who rebel against the light, not knowing its ways or staying on its paths.</verse>
  <verse number="14">When daylight is gone, the murderer rises to kill the poor and needy; in the night he is like a thief.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The eye of the adulterer watches for twilight. Thinking, ‘No eye will see me,’ he covers his face.</verse>
  <verse number="16">In the dark they dig through houses; by day they shut themselves in, never to experience the light.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For to them, deep darkness is their morning; surely they are friends with the terrors of darkness!</verse>
  <verse number="18">They are but foam on the surface of the water; their portion of the land is cursed, so that no one turns toward their vineyards.</verse>
  <verse number="19">As drought and heat consume the melting snow, so Sheol steals those who have sinned.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The womb forgets them; the worm feeds on them; they are remembered no more. So injustice is broken like a tree.</verse>
  <verse number="21">They prey on the barren and childless, and show no kindness to the widow.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Yet by His power, God drags away the mighty; though rising up, they have no assurance of life.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He gives them a sense of security, but His eyes are on their ways.</verse>
  <verse number="24">They are exalted for a moment, then they are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like heads of grain.</verse>
  <verse number="25">If this is not so, then who can prove me a liar and reduce my words to nothing?”</verse>
