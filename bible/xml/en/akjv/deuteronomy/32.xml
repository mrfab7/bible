<chapter book="Deuteronomy" number="32" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Give ear, O you heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="2">My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain on the tender herb, and as the showers on the grass:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe you greatness to our God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.</verse>
  <verse number="5">They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Do you thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he your father that has bought you? has he not made you, and established you?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will tell you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For the LORD’s portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.</verse>
  <verse number="11">As an eagle stirs up her nest, flutters over her young, spreads abroad her wings, takes them, bears them on her wings:</verse>
  <verse number="12">So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Butter of cows, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and you did drink the pure blood of the grape.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: you are waxen fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="16">They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They sacrificed to devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Of the Rock that begat you you are unmindful, and have forgotten God that formed you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very fraudulent generation, children in whom is no faith.</verse>
  <verse number="21">They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For a fire is kindled in my anger, and shall burn to the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.</verse>
  <verse number="23">I will heap mischiefs on them; I will spend my arrows on them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts on them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.</verse>
  <verse number="26">I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:</verse>
  <verse number="27">Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD has not done all this.</verse>
  <verse number="28">For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them.</verse>
  <verse number="29">O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!</verse>
  <verse number="30">How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?</verse>
  <verse number="31">For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:</verse>
  <verse number="33">Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures?</verse>
  <verse number="35">To me belongs vengeance and recompense; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come on them make haste.</verse>
  <verse number="36">For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he sees that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted,</verse>
  <verse number="38">Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.</verse>
  <verse number="39">See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.</verse>
  <verse number="40">For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="41">If I whet my glittering sword, and my hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to my enemies, and will reward them that hate me.</verse>
  <verse number="42">I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges on the enemy.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Rejoice, O you nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful to his land, and to his people.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:</verse>
  <verse number="46">And he said to them, Set your hearts to all the words which I testify among you this day, which you shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.</verse>
  <verse number="47">For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over Jordan to possess it.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And the LORD spoke to Moses that selfsame day, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="49">Get you up into this mountain Abarim, to mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel for a possession:</verse>
  <verse number="50">And die in the mount where you go up, and be gathered to your people; as Aaron your brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered to his people:</verse>
  <verse number="51">Because you trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you sanctified me not in the middle of the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="52">Yet you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go thither to the land which I give the children of Israel.</verse>
