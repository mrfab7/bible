<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A roll of the birth of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and Judah begat Pharez and Zarah of Tamar, and Pharez begat Hezron, and Hezron begat Ram,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and Ram begat Amminadab, and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth, and Obed begat Jesse,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and Jesse begat David the king. And David the king begat Solomon, of her who had been Uriah’s,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and Solomon begat Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begat Abijah, and Abijah begat Asa,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">and Asa begat Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat Uzziah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz begat Hezekiah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and Hezekiah begat Manasseh, and Manasseh begat Amon, and Amon begat Josiah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brethren, at the Babylonian removal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And after the Babylonian removal, Jeconiah begat Shealtiel, and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and Zerubbabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and Azor begat Sadok, and Sadok begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">and Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was begotten Jesus, who is named Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">All the generations, therefore, from Abraham unto David are fourteen generations, and from David unto the Babylonian removal fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian removal unto the Christ, fourteen generations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And of Jesus Christ, the birth was thus: For his mother Mary having been betrothed to Joseph, before their coming together she was found to have conceived from the Holy Spirit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and Joseph her husband being righteous, and not willing to make her an example, did wish privately to send her away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And on his thinking of these things, lo, a messenger of the Lord in a dream appeared to him, saying, ‘Joseph, son of David, thou mayest not fear to receive Mary thy wife, for that which in her was begotten is of the Holy Spirit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And all this hath come to pass, that it may be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Lo, the virgin shall conceive, and she shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,’ which is, being interpreted ‘With us he is God.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Joseph, having risen from the sleep, did as the messenger of the Lord directed him, and received his wife,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">and did not know her till she brought forth her son—the first-born, and he called his name Jesus.</p>
