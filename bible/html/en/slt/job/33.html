<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And yet hear now, O Job, my speech, and give ear to all my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Behold, now, I opened my mouth, my tongue spake in my palate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">My sayings the uprightness of my heart, and my lips spake knowledge purely.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The spirit of God made me, and the breath of the Almighty will cause me to live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If thou shalt be able to turn back to me, set in order before me, stand forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Behold, I am according to thy mouth for God: from clay was I also broken off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, and my hand shall not be heavy upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Surely thou spakest in mine ear and I will hear the voice of thy words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I am clean without transgression; I am fair, and no iniquity to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Behold, he will find enmity against me, and he will reckon me for an enemy to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He will set my feet in the stocks, he will watch all my paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Behold, this thou wert not just: I will answer thee, for God will be great above man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Wherefore didst thou contend against him? for he will not answer all his words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For God will speak at once, and at a second time, and he shall not regard it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">In a dream, in a vision of the night, in the falling of deep sleep upon men, in slumbers upon the bed;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Then he will uncover the ear of men, and will seal in their instruction,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">To remove man from working, and he will bide pride from man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He will keep back his soul from the pit, and his life from passing away by the spear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And he was chastened with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones perpetually.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">His life loathed bread, and his soul food of desire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His flesh will consume away from seeing, and they saw not the nakedness of his bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And his soul will draw near to the pit, and his life to the dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If there is a messenger upon him, an interpreter, one from a thousand, to announce to man his uprightness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And he will compassionate him and say, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I found an expiation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">His flesh revived above a youth: he shall turn back to the days of his childhood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He shall pray to God and he shall receive him into favor: and he shall see his face with rejoicing, and he will turn back to man his justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He will look upon men, and he shall say, I sinned, and I perverted the right, and it was not fitting to me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Redeem my soul from passing into the pit, and my life shall look upon light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Behold, all these God will work twice, thrice, with man,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">To turn back his soul from the pit, to enlighten with the light of the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Attend, O Job, hear to me: be silent and I will speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">If there be words, turn back to me: speak, for I desired to justify thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If not, hear thou to me: be silent, and I shall teach thee wisdom.</p>
