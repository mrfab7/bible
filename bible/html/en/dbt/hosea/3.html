<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah said unto me, Go again, love a woman beloved of a friend, and an adulteress, according to the love of Jehovah for the children of Israel, though they turn to other gods, and love raisin-cakes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">So I bought her to me for fifteen silver [pieces], and for a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be [another] manâ€™s, and I will also be for thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without statue, and without ephod and teraphim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Afterwards shall the children of Israel return, and seek Jehovah their God, and David their king; and shall turn with fear toward Jehovah and toward his goodness, at the end of the days.</p>
