<div class="chapter" data-book="2 Timothy" data-chapter="3" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And this know thou, that in the last days there shall come perilous times,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">for men shall be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, evil-speakers, to parents disobedient, unthankful, unkind,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">without natural affection, implacable, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, not lovers of those who are good,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">traitors, heady, lofty, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">having a form of piety, and its power having denied; and from these be turning away,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">for of these there are those coming into the houses and leading captive the silly women, laden with sins, led away with desires manifold,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">always learning, and never to a knowledge of truth able to come,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">and, even as Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses, so also these do stand against the truth, men corrupted in mind, disapproved concerning the faith;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">but they shall not advance any further, for their folly shall be manifest to all, as theirs also did become.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And thou—thou hast followed after my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, endurance,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">the persecutions, the afflictions, that befell me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of all the Lord did deliver me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">and all also who will to live piously in Christ Jesus shall be persecuted,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and evil men and impostors shall advance to the worse, leading astray and being led astray.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And thou—be remaining in the things which thou didst learn and wast entrusted with, having known from whom thou didst learn,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and because from a babe the Holy Writings thou hast known, which are able to make thee wise—to salvation, through faith that is in Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">every Writing is God-breathed, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for setting aright, for instruction that is in righteousness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">that the man of God may be fitted—for every good work having been completed.</p>
