<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Childrenâ€™s children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He that covereth a transgression seeketh love: but he that harpeth on a matter separateth chief friends.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A rebuke entereth deeper into one that hath understanding than an hundred stripes into a fool.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, seeing he hath no understanding?</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: when he shutteth his lips, he is esteemed as prudent.</p>
