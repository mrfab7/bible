<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, even by reason of my haste that is in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame. The spirit of my understanding answers me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Don’t you know this from old time, since man was placed on earth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">that the triumphing of the wicked is short, the joy of the godless but for a moment?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Though his height mount up to the heavens, and his head reach to the clouds,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">yet he shall perish forever like his own dung. Those who have seen him shall say, ‘Where is he?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found. Yes, he shall be chased away like a vision of the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The eye which saw him shall see him no more, neither shall his place any more see him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">His children shall seek the favor of the poor. His hands shall give back his wealth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">His bones are full of his youth, but youth shall lie down with him in the dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">“Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">though he spare it, and will not let it go, but keep it still within his mouth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">yet his food in his bowels is turned. It is cobra venom within him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He has swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again. God will cast them out of his belly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He shall suck cobra venom. The viper’s tongue shall kill him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He shall not look at the rivers, the flowing streams of honey and butter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">That for which he labored he shall restore, and shall not swallow it down. According to the substance that he has gotten, he shall not rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor. He has violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">“Because he knew no quietness within him, he shall not save anything of that in which he delights.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">There was nothing left that he didn’t devour, therefore his prosperity shall not endure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">In the fullness of his sufficiency, distress shall overtake him. The hand of everyone who is in misery shall come on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him. It will rain on him while he is eating.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He shall flee from the iron weapon. The bronze arrow shall strike him through.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He draws it forth, and it comes out of his body. Yes, the glittering point comes out of his liver. Terrors are on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">All darkness is laid up for his treasures. An unfanned fire shall devour him. It shall consume that which is left in his tent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The heavens shall reveal his iniquity. The earth shall rise up against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The increase of his house shall depart. They shall rush away in the day of his wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">This is the portion of a wicked man from God, the heritage appointed to him by God.”</p>
