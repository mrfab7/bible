  <verse number="1">It happened in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it; and they built forts against it around it.</verse>
  <verse number="2">So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</verse>
  <verse number="3">On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden (now the Chaldeans were against the city around it); and the king went by the way of the Arabah.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook him in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment on him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, a servant of the king of Babylon, to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He burnt the house of Yahweh, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house, burnt he with fire.</verse>
  <verse number="10">All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls around Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive the residue of the people who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to work the vineyards and fields.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The Chaldeans broke up the pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh, and carried the brass pieces to Babylon.</verse>
  <verse number="14">They took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The captain of the guard took away the fire pans, the basins, that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver, in silver.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The two pillars, the one sea, and the bases, which Solomon had made for the house of Yahweh, the brass of all these vessels was without weight.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and a capital of brass was on it; and the height of the capital was three cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital around it, all of brass: and like to these had the second pillar with network.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold:</verse>
  <verse number="19">and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men of war; and five men of those who saw the king’s face, who were found in the city; and the scribe, the captain of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the city.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away captive out of his land.</verse>
  <verse number="22">As for the people who were left in the land of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Now when all the captains of the forces, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of the Maacathite, they and their men.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Gedaliah swore to them and to their men, and said to them, “Don’t be afraid because of the servants of the Chaldeans. Dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">But it happened in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the royal seed came, and ten men with him, and struck Gedaliah, so that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldeans that were with him at Mizpah.</verse>
  <verse number="26">All the people, both small and great, and the captains of the forces, arose, and came to Egypt; for they were afraid of the Chaldeans.</verse>
  <verse number="27">It happened in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;</verse>
  <verse number="28">and he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings who were with him in Babylon,</verse>
  <verse number="29">and changed his prison garments. Jehoiachin ate bread before him continually all the days of his life:</verse>
  <verse number="30">and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given him of the king, every day a portion, all the days of his life.</verse>
