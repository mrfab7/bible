<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After these words, the word of Jehovah was to Abram in a vision, saying, Thou shalt not fear, Abram: I a shield to thee, thy reward great exceedingly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Abram will say, My Lord Jehovah, what wilt thou give to me, and I going childless, and the son of Masek in my house, he Eliezer of Damascus?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Abram will say, Behold, to me thou gavest no seed, and behold the son of my house shall inherit me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And behold, the word of Jehovah was to him, saying, This shall not inherit thee, for truly he who shall come forth from thy bowels shall inherit thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And he will bring him forth without, and will say, Now look to the heavens and count the stars, if thou shalt be able to count them: and he will say to him, So shall be thy seed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he believed in Jehovah; and it shall be reckoned to him justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he will say to him, I am Jehovah who brought thee from Ur of the Chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he will say, My Lord Jehovah, how shall I know that I shall inherit it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he will say to him, Take to me a heifer of three, and a goat of three, and a ram of three, and a turtle dove, and a young pigeon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he will take to him all these, and he will divide them, asunder in the midst, and will put each of its parts divided, opposite its companion: and the birds he divided not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the birds will come down upon the dead carcases, and Abram will drive them together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the sun shall be going down, and a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and behold terror and great darkness fell upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And he will say to Abram, Knowing thou shalt know that thy seed shall be a sojourner in the land not to them; and they shall serve them and they shall humble them four hundred years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And also the nation whom they shall serve, I will judge, and after this they shall come forth with great substance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And thou shalt go to thy fathers in tranquillity; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the fourth generation they shall turn back hither: for the crime of the Amorite has not been completed till now.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the sun shall be going down, and it was thick darkness, and behold a furnace of smoke and a lamp of fire that passed over between these pieces.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">In that day Jehovah cut out a covenant with Abram, saying, To thy seed gave I this land from the river of Egypt, to the great river, the river Euphrates:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The Kenites and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the Amorites and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.</p>
