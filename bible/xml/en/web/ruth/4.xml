  <verse number="1">Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat down there. Behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; to whom he said, “Come over here, friend, and sit down!” He turned aside, and sat down.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, “Sit down here.” They sat down.</verse>
  <verse number="3">He said to the near kinsman, “Naomi, who has come back out of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech’s.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I thought to disclose it to you, saying, ‘Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my people.’ If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if you will not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know. For there is no one to redeem it besides you; and I am after you.” He said, “I will redeem it.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from the hand of Naomi, you must buy it also from Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">The near kinsman said, “I can’t redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption for yourself; for I can’t redeem it.”</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now this was the custom in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: a man took off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor; and this was the way of attestation in Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="8">So the near kinsman said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself.” He took off his shoe.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, “You are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, from the hand of Naomi.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I have purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance, that the name of the dead not be cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place. You are witnesses this day.”</verse>
  <verse number="11">All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, “We are witnesses. May Yahweh make the woman who has come into your house like Rachel and like Leah, which two built the house of Israel; and treat you worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which Yahweh shall give you of this young woman.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in to her, and Yahweh gave her conception, and she bore a son.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The women said to Naomi, “Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left you this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be famous in Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="15">He shall be to you a restorer of life, and sustain you in your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you, who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.”</verse>
  <verse number="16">Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse to it.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The women, her neighbors, gave him a name, saying, “There is a son born to Naomi;” and they named him Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Now this is the history of the generations of Perez: Perez became the father of Hezron,</verse>
  <verse number="19">and Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became the father of Amminadab,</verse>
  <verse number="20">and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon,</verse>
  <verse number="21">and Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became the father of Obed,</verse>
  <verse number="22">and Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became the father of David.</verse>
