<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="14" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For he that speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not to men, but to God: for no man understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But he that prophesies speaks to men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He that speaks in an unknown tongue edifies himself; but he that prophesies edifies the church.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I would that you all spoke with tongues but rather that you prophesied: for greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for you shall speak into the air.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks shall be a barbarian to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Even so you, for as much as you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Why let him that speaks in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Else when you shall bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupies the room of the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he understands not what you say?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For you truly give thanks well, but the other is not edified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than you all:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Brothers, be not children in understanding: however, in malice be you children, but in understanding be men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak to this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, said the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Why tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serves not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believes not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">How is it then, brothers? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edifying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">If any thing be revealed to another that sits by, let the first hold his peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For you may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also said the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">What? came the word of God out from you? or came it to you only?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Why, brothers, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Let all things be done decently and in order.</p>
