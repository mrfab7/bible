<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Dare any one of you, having a matter against another, prosecute his suit before the unjust, and not before the saints?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Do ye not then know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy of [the] smallest judgments?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Do ye not know that we shall judge angels? and not then matters of this life?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If then ye have judgments as to things of this life, set those [to judge] who are little esteemed in the assembly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I speak to you [to put you] to shame. Thus there is not a wise person among you, not even one, who shall be able to decide between his brethren!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But brother prosecutes his suit with brother, and that before unbelievers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Already indeed then it is altogether a fault in you that ye have suits between yourselves. Why do ye not rather suffer wrong? why are ye not rather defrauded?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But ye do wrong, and defraud, and this [your] brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Do ye not know that unrighteous [persons] shall not inherit [the] kingdom of God? Do not err: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor those who make women of themselves, nor who abuse themselves with men,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor abusive persons, nor [the] rapacious, shall inherit [the] kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And these things were some of you; but ye have been washed, but ye have been sanctified, but ye have been justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">All things are lawful to me, but all things do not profit; all things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; but God will bring to nothing both it and them: but the body [is] not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And God has both raised up the Lord, and will raise us up from among [the dead] by his power.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Do ye not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then, taking the members of the Christ, make [them] members of a harlot? Far be the thought.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Do ye not know that he [that is] joined to the harlot is one body? for the two, he says, shall be one flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But he that [is] joined to the Lord is one Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Flee fornication. Every sin which a man may practise is without the body, but he that commits fornication sins against his own body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Do ye not know that your body is [the] temple of the Holy Spirit which [is] in you, which ye have of God; and ye are not your own?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">for ye have been bought with a price: glorify now then God in your body.</p>
