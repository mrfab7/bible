<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Timothy" data-chapter="2" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And so I beg you, first of all, to make supplications, prayers, petitions, and thanksgivings for all men,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">for kings, and for all who are in high places, so that we may lead a quiet and tranquil life in all piety and chastity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">who wants all men to be saved and to arrive at an acknowledgment of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For there is one God, and one mediator of God and of men, the man Christ Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">who gave himself as a redemption for all, as a testimony in its proper time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Of this testimony, I have been appointed a preacher and an Apostle, (I speak the truth, I do not lie) as a teacher of the Gentiles, in faith and in truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Therefore, I want men to pray in every place, lifting up pure hands, without anger or dissension.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Similarly also, women should be dressed fittingly, adorning themselves with compunction and restraint, and not with plaited hair, nor gold, nor pearls, nor costly attire,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">but in a manner proper for women who are professing piety by means of good works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Let a woman learn in silence with all subjection.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For I do not permit a woman to teach, nor to be in authority over a man, but to be in silence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For Adam was formed first, then Eve.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Adam was not seduced, but the woman, having been seduced, was in transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Yet she will be saved by bearing children, if she has continued in faith and love, and in sanctification accompanied by self-restraint.</p>
