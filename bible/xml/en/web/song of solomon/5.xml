<chapter book="Song of Solomon" number="5" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride. I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, friends! Drink, yes, drink abundantly, beloved.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I was asleep, but my heart was awake. It is the voice of my beloved who knocks: “Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled; for my head is filled with dew, and my hair with the dampness of the night.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">I have taken off my robe. Indeed, must I put it on? I have washed my feet. Indeed, must I soil them?</verse>
  <verse number="4">My beloved thrust his hand in through the latch opening. My heart pounded for him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I rose up to open for my beloved. My hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the handles of the lock.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I opened to my beloved; but my beloved left; and had gone away. My heart went out when he spoke. I looked for him, but I didn’t find him. I called him, but he didn’t answer.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The watchmen who go about the city found me. They beat me. They bruised me. The keepers of the walls took my cloak away from me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, If you find my beloved, that you tell him that I am faint with love.</verse>
  <verse number="9">How is your beloved better than another beloved, you fairest among women? How is your beloved better than another beloved, that you do so adjure us?</verse>
  <verse number="10">My beloved is white and ruddy. The best among ten thousand.</verse>
  <verse number="11">His head is like the purest gold. His hair is bushy, black as a raven.</verse>
  <verse number="12">His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks, washed with milk, mounted like jewels.</verse>
  <verse number="13">His cheeks are like a bed of spices with towers of perfumes. His lips are like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.</verse>
  <verse number="14">His hands are like rings of gold set with beryl. His body is like ivory work overlaid with sapphires.</verse>
  <verse number="15">His legs are like pillars of marble set on sockets of fine gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</verse>
  <verse number="16">His mouth is sweetness; yes, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, daughters of Jerusalem.</verse>
