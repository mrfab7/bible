<p class="verse" data-verse="1">If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall you also appear with him in glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For which thingsâ€™ sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In the which you also walked some time, when you lived in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But now you also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Lie not one to another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his deeds;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfection.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also you are called in one body; and be you thankful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing to the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not to men;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for you serve the Lord Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But he that does wrong shall receive for the wrong which he has done: and there is no respect of persons.</p>
