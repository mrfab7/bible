  <verse number="1">And when he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about half an hour.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And I saw the seven angels who stood before God; and seven trumpets were given to them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And another angel came and was placed by the altar, having a golden censer; and many perfumes were given him, that he might give to the prayers of the holy upon the golden altar before the throne.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the smoke of the perfumes went up, with the prayers of the holy, from the angel’s hand before God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the angel took the censer, and filled it from the fire of the altar, and cast into the earth: and there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings, and an earthquake.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the seven angels having the seven trumpets prepared themselves that they might sound the trumpets.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the first angel sounded the trumpet, and there were hail and fire mingled with blood, and it was cast into the earth: and a third of the trees were burned down, and all green grass was burned down.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the second angel sounded the trumpet, and as a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third of the sea was blood;</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the third of the creatures which in the sea, died, those having souls; and the third of the ships were destroyed.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the third angel sounded the trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, burning as a torch, and it fell upon a third of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third of the waters is into wormwood; and many of men died of the waters, for they were rendered bitter.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the fourth angel sounded the trumpet, and the third of the sun was stricken, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars; that a third of them might be darkened, and the day shone not, a third of it, and the night likewise.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And I saw, and heard one angel flying in the midst of heaven, saying with a great voice, Woe, woe, woe, to them dwelling upon earth from the rest of the voices of the trumpet of the three angels, about to sound the trumpet!</verse>
