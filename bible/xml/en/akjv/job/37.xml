<chapter book="Job" number="37" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">At this also my heart trembles, and is moved out of his place.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goes out of his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">He directs it under the whole heaven, and his lightning to the ends of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">After it a voice roars: he thunders with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.</verse>
  <verse number="5">God thunders marvelously with his voice; great things does he, which we cannot comprehend.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For he said to the snow, Be you on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He seals up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Out of the south comes the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.</verse>
  <verse number="10">By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Also by watering he wearies the thick cloud: he scatters his bright cloud:</verse>
  <verse number="12">And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatever he commands them on the face of the world in the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He causes it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Listen to this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Do you know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?</verse>
  <verse number="16">Do you know the balancing of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?</verse>
  <verse number="17">How your garments are warm, when he quiets the earth by the south wind?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Have you with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Teach us what we shall say to him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passes, and cleans them.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Fair weather comes out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Men do therefore fear him: he respects not any that are wise of heart.</verse>
