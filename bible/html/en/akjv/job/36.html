<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Elihu also proceeded, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Suffer me a little, and I will show you that I have yet to speak on Godâ€™s behalf.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Behold, God is mighty, and despises not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He preserves not the life of the wicked: but gives right to the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He withdraws not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yes, he does establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And if they be bound in fetters, and be held in cords of affliction;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then he shows them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He opens also their ear to discipline, and commands that they return from iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he binds them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He delivers the poor in his affliction, and opens their ears in oppression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Even so would he have removed you out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no narrow place; and that which should be set on your table should be full of fatness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But you have fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Because there is wrath, beware lest he take you away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Will he esteem your riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this have you chosen rather than affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Behold, God exalts by his power: who teaches like him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Who has enjoined him his way? or who can say, You have worked iniquity?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Remember that you magnify his work, which men behold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For he makes small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapor thereof:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Which the clouds do drop and distil on man abundantly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Also can any understand the spreading of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Behold, he spreads his light on it, and covers the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For by them judges he the people; he gives meat in abundance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">With clouds he covers the light; and commands it not to shine by the cloud that comes between.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The noise thereof shows concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapor.</p>
