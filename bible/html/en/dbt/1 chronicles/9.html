<p class="verse" data-verse="27">for they stayed round about the house of God during the night, because the charge was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning [pertained] to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And [part] of them had the charge of the instruments of service, for by number they brought them in and by number they brought them out.</p>
