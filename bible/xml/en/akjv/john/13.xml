  <verse number="1">Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him;</verse>
  <verse number="3">Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;</verse>
  <verse number="4">He rises from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a towel, and girded himself.</verse>
  <verse number="5">After that he pours water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples’ feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then comes he to Simon Peter: and Peter said to him, Lord, do you wash my feet?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Jesus answered and said to him, What I do you know not now; but you shall know hereafter.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Peter said to him, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash you not, you have no part with me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Simon Peter said to him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Jesus said to him, He that is washed needs not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and you are clean, but not all.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, You are not all clean.</verse>
  <verse number="12">So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments, and was set down again, he said to them, Know you what I have done to you?</verse>
  <verse number="13">You call me Master and Lord: and you say well; for so I am.</verse>
  <verse number="14">If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another’s feet.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done to you.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Truly, truly, I say to you, The servant is not greater than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">If you know these things, happy are you if you do them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass, you may believe that I am he.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Truly, truly, I say to you, He that receives whomsoever I send receives me; and he that receives me receives him that sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, that one of you shall betray me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Now there was leaning on Jesus’ bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spoke.</verse>
  <verse number="25">He then lying on Jesus’ breast said to him, Lord, who is it?</verse>
  <verse number="26">Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus to him, That you do, do quickly.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spoke this to him.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said to him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast; or, that he should give something to the poor.</verse>
  <verse number="30">He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it was night.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in himself, and shall straightway glorify him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me: and as I said to the Jews, Where I go, you cannot come; so now I say to you.</verse>
  <verse number="34">A new commandment I give to you, That you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.</verse>
  <verse number="35">By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one to another.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Simon Peter said to him, Lord, where go you? Jesus answered him, Where I go, you can not follow me now; but you shall follow me afterwards.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Peter said to him, Lord, why cannot I follow you now? I will lay down my life for your sake.</verse>
  <verse number="38">Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for my sake? Truly, truly, I say to you, The cock shall not crow, till you have denied me thrice.</verse>
