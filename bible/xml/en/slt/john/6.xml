  <verse number="1">After these Jesus departed beyond the sea of Galilee, of Tiberias.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And a great crowd followed him, for they saw his signs which he did upon the sick.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Jesus went up into the mount, and sat there with his disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the pascha was near, the festival of the Jews.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then Jesus having lifted up the eyes, and seen that a great crowd comes to him, says to Philip, Whence shall we buy loaves that these might eat?</verse>
  <verse number="6">And this he said trying him: for himself knew what he was about to do.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Philip answered him. Loaves of two hundred drachmas will not suffice them, that each of them should take some little.</verse>
  <verse number="8">One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, says to him,</verse>
  <verse number="9">There is one little boy here, who has five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are these among so many?</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Jesus said, Make the men recline. And there was much grass in the place. Then the men reclined, the number about five thousand.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Jesus took the loaves; and having given thanks, distributed to his disciples, and the disciples to the reclining; and likewise of the small fishes, as many as they wished.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And when they were filled, he says to his disciples, Gather the fragments remaining over, that nothing should be lost.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then gathered they, and filled twelve baskets of the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over to them having eaten.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then the men, having seen the sign which Jesus did, said, That this is truly the prophet coming into the world.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then Jesus having known that they were about to come and carry him of forcibly, that they might make him king, departed again to the mount alone.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And when it was evening, his disciples went down to the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And having entered into a ship, they came beyond the sea to Capernaum. And already was there darkness, and Jesus had not come to them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the sea, a great wind blowing, arose.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Then having urged forward about twenty-five or thirty stadia, they behold Jesus walking upon the sea, and being near the ship: and they were afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he says to them, I am; be not afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then they wished to take him into the ship: and the ship was quickly at land to which they retired.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The morrow, the crowd standing beyond the sea having seen that no other small vessel was there, except that one into which his disciples had entered, and that Jesus entered not with his disciples into the small vessel, but his disciples departed alone;</verse>
  <verse number="23">(But also other small vessels came out of Tiberias near to the place where they ate bread, the Lord having returned thanks:)</verse>
  <verse number="24">When the crowd therefore saw that Jesus is not there, nor his disciples, they also entered into ships, and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And having found them beyond the sea, they said to him, Rabbi, when camest thou here?</verse>
  <verse number="26">Jesus answered them and said, Truly, truly, I say to you, ye seek me, not because ye saw signs, but for that ye ate of the loaves, and were satisfied.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Work not for food perishing, but food remaining to eternal life, which the Son of man will give you: for him God the Father sealed.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then said they to him, What shall we do, that we might work the works of God?</verse>
  <verse number="29">Jesus answered and said to them, This is the work of God, that ye should believe in him whom he has sent.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Then said they to him, What sign doest thou, that we might see, and believe thee? what workest thou?</verse>
  <verse number="31">Our fathers ate manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Then said Jesus to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses has not given you bread from heaven; but my Father gives you true bread from heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="33">For the bread of God is he coming down from heaven, and giving life to the world.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Then said they to him, Lord, always give us this bread.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he coming to me should not hunger; and he believing in me should not thirst.</verse>
  <verse number="36">But I said to you, That ye have seen me, and believe not.</verse>
  <verse number="37">All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and he coming to me I will not cast out.</verse>
  <verse number="38">For I have come down from heaven, not that I might do my will, but the will of him having sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And this is the will of the Father having sent me, that all which he has given me, I should not loose of it, but raise it up in the last day.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And this is the will of him having sent me, that every one seeing the Son, and believing in him, should have eternal life: and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Then murmured the Jews about him, because he said, I am the bread having come down from heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And they said, Is not this Jesus, Joseph’s son, whose father and mother we know? how then says he, That I have come down from heaven?</verse>
  <verse number="43">Then answered Jesus and said to them, Murmur not with one another.</verse>
  <verse number="44">None can come to me, except the Father having sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
  <verse number="45">It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of God. Every one therefore having heard and learned of the Father, comes to me.</verse>
  <verse number="46">Not that any one has seen the Father, except he being from God, he has seen the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="47">Truly, truly, I say to you, he believing in me has eternal life.</verse>
  <verse number="48">I am the bread of life.</verse>
  <verse number="49">Your fathers ate manna in the desert, and died.</verse>
  <verse number="50">This is the bread which coming down from heaven, that whoever should eat of it, and he should not die.</verse>
  <verse number="51">I am the living bread which having come down from heaven: if any one eat of this bread, he shall live forever: and also the bread which I shall give is my flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="52">Then the Jews contended with one another, saying, How can he give us the flesh to eat.</verse>
  <verse number="53">Then said Jesus to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in yourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="54">He chewing my flesh, and drinking my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
  <verse number="55">For my flesh is truly food, and my blood is truly drink.</verse>
  <verse number="56">He chewing my flesh, and drinking my blood, remains in me, and I in him.</verse>
  <verse number="57">As the living Father sent me, and I live through the Father: also he chewing me, the same also shall live through me.</verse>
  <verse number="58">This is the bread which having come down from heaven: not as your fathers ate manna, and died: he chewing this bread shall live forever.</verse>
  <verse number="59">He said these, teaching in the synagogue, in Capernaum.</verse>
  <verse number="60">Then many of his disciples, having heard, said, This is a hard word; who can hear it.</verse>
  <verse number="61">And Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmur for this, said to them, Does this offend you?</verse>
  <verse number="62">If then ye see the Son of man going up where he was before.</verse>
  <verse number="63">It is the spirit making alive; the flesh profits nothing: the words which I speak to you are spirit, and are life.</verse>
  <verse number="64">But there are some of you who believe not. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they are not believing, and who he is going to deliver him up.</verse>
  <verse number="65">And he said, Therefore have I said to you, that no one can come to me, except it be given him of my Father.</verse>
  <verse number="66">From this many of his disciples went away back, and walked no more with him.</verse>
  <verse number="67">Then said Jesus to the twelve, And ye will not go away?</verse>
  <verse number="68">Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go away? thou hast the words of eternal life.</verse>
  <verse number="69">And we have believed, and known, that thou art Christ, Son of the living God.</verse>
  <verse number="70">Jesus answered them, Have I not chosen you twelve, and of you one is a devil?</verse>
  <verse number="71">And he spake of Judas Iscariot, of Simon: for he was about to deliver him up, being one of the twelve.</verse>
