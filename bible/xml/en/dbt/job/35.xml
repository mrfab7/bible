  <verse number="1">Moreover Elihu answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God’s?</verse>
  <verse number="3">For thou hast asked of what profit it is unto thee: what do I gain more than if I had sinned?</verse>
  <verse number="4">I will reply to thee in words, and to thy companions with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Look unto the heavens and see; and survey the skies: they are higher than thou.</verse>
  <verse number="6">If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? If thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</verse>
  <verse number="7">If thou be righteous, what givest thou to him? or what doth he receive of thy hand?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thy wickedness [may affect] a man as thou [art], and thy righteousness a son of man.</verse>
  <verse number="9">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry; they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty:</verse>
  <verse number="10">But none saith, Where is +God my Maker, who giveth songs in the night,</verse>
  <verse number="11">Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowl of the heavens?</verse>
  <verse number="12">There they cry, and he answereth not, because of the pride of evil men.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Although thou sayest thou dost not see him, judgment is before him, therefore wait for him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, doth not [Job] know [his] great arrogancy?</verse>
  <verse number="16">For Job hath opened his mouth in vanity, and made words abundant without knowledge.</verse>
