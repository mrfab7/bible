  <verse number="1">I tell the truth in Christ. I am not lying, my conscience testifying with me in the Holy Spirit,</verse>
  <verse number="2">that I have great sorrow and unceasing pain in my heart.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers’ sake, my relatives according to the flesh,</verse>
  <verse number="4">who are Israelites; whose is the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service, and the promises;</verse>
  <verse number="5">of whom are the fathers, and from whom is Christ as concerning the flesh, who is over all, God, blessed forever. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But it is not as though the word of God has come to nothing. For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Neither, because they are Abraham’s seed, are they all children. But, “In Isaac will your seed be called.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as a seed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For this is a word of promise, “At the appointed time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.”</verse>
  <verse number="10">Not only so, but Rebecca also conceived by one, by our father Isaac.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For being not yet born, neither having done anything good or bad, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him who calls,</verse>
  <verse number="12">it was said to her, “The elder will serve the younger.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">Even as it is written, “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? May it never be!</verse>
  <verse number="15">For he said to Moses, “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”</verse>
  <verse number="16">So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who has mercy.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, “For this very purpose I caused you to be raised up, that I might show in you my power, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”</verse>
  <verse number="18">So then, he has mercy on whom he desires, and he hardens whom he desires.</verse>
  <verse number="19">You will say then to me, “Why does he still find fault? For who withstands his will?”</verse>
  <verse number="20">But indeed, O man, who are you to reply against God? Will the thing formed ask him who formed it, “Why did you make me like this?”</verse>
  <verse number="21">Or hasn’t the potter a right over the clay, from the same lump to make one part a vessel for honor, and another for dishonor?</verse>
  <verse number="22">What if God, willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath made for destruction,</verse>
  <verse number="23">and that he might make known the riches of his glory on vessels of mercy, which he prepared beforehand for glory,</verse>
  <verse number="24">us, whom he also called, not from the Jews only, but also from the Gentiles?</verse>
  <verse number="25">As he says also in Hosea, “I will call them ‘my people,’ which were not my people; and her ‘beloved,’ who was not beloved.”</verse>
  <verse number="26">“It will be that in the place where it was said to them, ‘You are not my people,’ There they will be called ‘children of the living God.’”</verse>
  <verse number="27">Isaiah cries concerning Israel, “If the number of the children of Israel are as the sand of the sea, it is the remnant who will be saved;</verse>
  <verse number="28">for He will finish the work and cut it short in righteousness, because the LORD will make a short work upon the earth.”</verse>
  <verse number="29">As Isaiah has said before, “Unless the Lord of Armies had left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom, and would have been made like Gomorrah.”</verse>
  <verse number="30">What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who didn’t follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith;</verse>
  <verse number="31">but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, didn’t arrive at the law of righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Why? Because they didn’t seek it by faith, but as it were by works of the law. They stumbled over the stumbling stone;</verse>
  <verse number="33">even as it is written, “Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense; and no one who believes in him will be disappointed.”</verse>
