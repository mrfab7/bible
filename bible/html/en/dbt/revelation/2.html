<p class="verse" data-verse="1">To the angel of the assembly in Ephesus write: These things says he that holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lamps:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I know thy works and [thy] labour, and thine endurance, and that thou canst not bear evil [men]; and thou hast tried them who say that themselves [are] apostles and are not, and hast found them liars;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and endurest, and hast borne for my nameâ€™s sake, and hast not wearied:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">but I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Remember therefore whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works: but if not, I am coming to thee, and I will remove thy lamp out of its place, except thou shalt repent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him that overcomes, I will give to him to eat of the tree of life which is in the paradise of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And to the angel of the assembly in Smyrna write: These things says the first and the last, who became dead, and lived:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I know thy tribulation and thy poverty; but thou art rich; and the railing of those who say that they themselves are Jews, and are not, but a synagogue of Satan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Fear nothing [of] what thou art about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give to thee the crown of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. He that overcomes shall in no wise be injured of the second death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And to the angel of the assembly in Pergamos write: These things says he that has the sharp two-edged sword:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">I know where thou dwellest, where the throne of Satan [is]; and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in the days in which Antipas my faithful witness [was], who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But I have a few things against thee: that thou hast there those who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a snare before the sons of Israel, to eat [of] idol sacrifices and commit fornication.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">So thou also hast those who hold the doctrine of Nicolaitanes in like manner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Repent therefore: but if not, I come to thee quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him that overcomes, to him will I give of the hidden manna; and I will give to him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he that receives [it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And to the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write: These things says the Son of God, he that has his eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet [are] like fine brass:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I know thy works, and love, and faith, and service, and thine endurance, and thy last works [to be] more than the first.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But I have against thee that thou permittest the woman Jezebel, she who calls herself prophetess, and she teaches and leads astray my servants to commit fornication and eat of idol sacrifices.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And I gave her time that she should repent, and she will not repent of her fornication.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">and her children will I kill with death; and all the assemblies shall know that I am he that searches [the] reins and [the] hearts; and I will give to you each according to your works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But to you I say, the rest who [are] in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I do not cast upon you any other burden;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">but what ye have hold fast till I shall come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And he that overcomes, and he that keeps unto the end my works, to him will I give authority over the nations,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">and he shall shepherd them with an iron rod; as vessels of pottery are they broken in pieces, as I also have received from my Father;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">and I will give to him the morning star.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.</p>
