  <verse number="1">If therefore ye have been raised with the Christ, seek the things [which are] above, where the Christ is, sitting at [the] right hand of God:</verse>
  <verse number="2">have your mind on the things [that are] above, not on the things [that are] on the earth;</verse>
  <verse number="3">for ye have died, and your life is hid with the Christ in God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">When the Christ is manifested who [is] our life, then shall ye also be manifested with him in glory.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Put to death therefore your members which [are] upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, vile passions, evil lust, and unbridled desire, which is idolatry.</verse>
  <verse number="6">On account of which things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.</verse>
  <verse number="7">In which ye also once walked when ye lived in these things.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But now, put off, ye also, all [these] things, wrath, anger, malice, blasphemy, vile language out of your mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Do not lie to one another, having put off the old man with his deeds,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and having put on the new, renewed into full knowledge according to [the] image of him that has created him;</verse>
  <verse number="11">wherein there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Christ [is] everything, and in all.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Put on therefore, as [the] elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering;</verse>
  <verse number="13">forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any should have a complaint against any; even as the Christ has forgiven you, so also [do] ye.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And to all these [add] love, which is the bond of perfectness.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And let the peace of Christ preside in your hearts, to which also ye have been called in one body, and be thankful.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Let the word of the Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another, in psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And everything, whatever ye may do in word or in deed, [do] all things in [the] name of [the] Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father by him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Wives, be subject to [your] husbands, as is fitting in [the] Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in [the] Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Fathers, do not vex your children, to the end that they be not disheartened.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Bondmen, obey in all things your masters according to flesh; not with eye-services, as men-pleasers, but in simplicity of heart, fearing the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Whatsoever ye do, labour at it heartily, as [doing it] to the Lord, and not to men;</verse>
  <verse number="24">knowing that of [the] Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance; ye serve the Lord Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For he that does a wrong shall receive the wrong he has done, and there is no respect of persons.</verse>
