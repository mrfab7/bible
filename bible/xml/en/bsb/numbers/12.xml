  <verse number="1">Then Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses because of the Cushite woman he had married, for he had taken a Cushite wife.</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Does the LORD speak only through Moses?” they said. “Does He not also speak through us?” And the LORD heard this.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Now Moses was a very humble man, more so than any man on the face of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And suddenly the LORD said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, “You three, come out to the Tent of Meeting.” So the three went out,</verse>
  <verse number="5">and the LORD came down in a pillar of cloud, stood at the entrance to the Tent, and summoned Aaron and Miriam. When both of them had stepped forward,</verse>
  <verse number="6">He said, “Hear now My words: If there is a prophet among you, I, the LORD, will reveal Myself to him in a vision; I will speak to him in a dream.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But this is not so with My servant Moses; he is faithful in all My house.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I speak with him face to face, clearly and not in riddles; he sees the form of the LORD. Why then were you unafraid to speak against My servant Moses?”</verse>
  <verse number="9">So the anger of the LORD burned against them, and He departed.</verse>
  <verse number="10">As the cloud lifted from above the Tent, suddenly Miriam became leprous, white as snow. Aaron turned toward her, saw that she was leprous,</verse>
  <verse number="11">and said to Moses, “My lord, please do not hold against us this sin we have so foolishly committed.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Please do not let her be like a stillborn infant whose flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother’s womb.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">So Moses cried out to the LORD, “O God, please heal her!”</verse>
  <verse number="14">But the LORD answered Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, would she not have been in disgrace for seven days? Let her be confined outside the camp for seven days; after that she may be brought back in.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until she was brought in again.</verse>
  <verse number="16">After that, the people set out from Hazeroth and camped in the Wilderness of Paran.</verse>
