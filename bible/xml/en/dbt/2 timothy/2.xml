  <verse number="1">Thou therefore, my child, be strong in the grace which [is] in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the things thou hast heard of me in the presence of many witnesses, these entrust to faithful men, such as shall be competent to instruct others also.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Take thy share in suffering as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="4">No one going as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of life, that he may please him who has enlisted him as a soldier.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And if also any one contend [in the games], he is not crowned unless he contend lawfully.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The husbandman must labour before partaking of the fruits.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Think of what I say, for the Lord will give thee understanding in all things.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Remember Jesus Christ raised from among [the] dead, of [the] seed of David, according to my glad tidings,</verse>
  <verse number="9">in which I suffer even unto bonds as an evil-doer: but the word of God is not bound.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For this cause I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which [is] in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The word [is] faithful; for if we have died together with [him], we shall also live together;</verse>
  <verse number="12">if we endure, we shall also reign together; if we deny, he also will deny us;</verse>
  <verse number="13">if we are unfaithful, he abides faithful, for he cannot deny himself.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Of these things put in remembrance, testifying earnestly before the Lord not to have disputes of words, profitable for nothing, to the subversion of the hearers.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Strive diligently to present thyself approved to God, a workman that has not to be ashamed, cutting in a straight line the word of truth.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But profane, vain babblings shun, for they will advance to greater impiety,</verse>
  <verse number="17">and their word will spread as a gangrene; of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</verse>
  <verse number="18">[men] who as to the truth have gone astray, saying that the resurrection has taken place already; and overthrow the faith of some.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Yet the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal, [The] Lord knows those that are his; and, Let every one who names the name of [the] Lord withdraw from iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wooden and earthen; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.</verse>
  <verse number="21">If therefore one shall have purified himself from these, [in separating himself from them], he shall be a vessel to honour, sanctified, serviceable to the Master, prepared for every good work.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But youthful lusts flee, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace, with those that call upon the Lord out of a pure heart.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But foolish and senseless questionings avoid, knowing that they beget contentions.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And a bondman of [the] Lord ought not to contend, but be gentle towards all; apt to teach; forbearing;</verse>
  <verse number="25">in meekness setting right those who oppose, if God perhaps may sometime give them repentance to acknowledgment of [the] truth,</verse>
  <verse number="26">and that they may awake up out of the snare of the devil, [who are] taken by him, for his will.</verse>
