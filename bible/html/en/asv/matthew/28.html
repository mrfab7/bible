<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now late on the sabbath day, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled away the stone, and sat upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">His appearance was as lightning, and his raiment white as snow:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and for fear of him the watchers did quake, and became as dead men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye; for I know that ye seek Jesus, who hath been crucified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He is not here; for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And go quickly, and tell his disciples, He is risen from the dead; and lo, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And behold, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. And they came and took hold of his feet, and worshipped him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then saith Jesus unto them, Fear not: go tell my brethren that they depart into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave much money unto the soldiers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And if this come to the governorâ€™s ears, we will persuade him, and rid you of care.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continueth until this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And when they saw him, they worshipped him; but some doubted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Jesus came to them and spake unto them, saying, All authority hath been given unto me in heaven and on earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Go ye therefore, and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.</p>
