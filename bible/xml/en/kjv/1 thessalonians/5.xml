<chapter book="1 Thessalonians" number="5" translation="King James Bible" translationID="kjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Therefore let us not sleep, as [do] others; but let us watch and be sober.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
  <verse number="10">Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;</verse>
  <verse number="13">And to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. [And] be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all [men].</verse>
  <verse number="15">See that none render evil for evil unto any [man]; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all [men].</verse>
  <verse number="16">Rejoice evermore.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Pray without ceasing.</verse>
  <verse number="18">In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Quench not the Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Despise not prophesyings.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Abstain from all appearance of evil.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and [I pray God] your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Faithful [is] he that calleth you, who also will do [it].</verse>
  <verse number="25">Brethren, pray for us.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.</verse>
  <verse number="27">I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you. Amen.</verse>
