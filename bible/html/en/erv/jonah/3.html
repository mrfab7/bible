<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days’ journey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he made proclamation and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, which he said he would do unto them; and he did it not.</p>
