<chapter book="Job" number="41" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">“Can you pull in Leviathan with a hook or tie down his tongue with a rope?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Will he beg you for mercy or speak to you softly?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Will he make a covenant with you to take him as a slave for life?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Can you pet him like a bird or put him on a leash for your maidens?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Will traders barter for him or divide him among the merchants?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?</verse>
  <verse number="8">If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the battle and never repeat it!</verse>
  <verse number="9">Surely hope of overcoming him is false. Is not the sight of him overwhelming?</verse>
  <verse number="10">No one is so fierce as to rouse Leviathan. Then who is able to stand against Me?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Who has given to Me that I should repay him? Everything under heaven is Mine.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I cannot keep silent about his limbs, his power and graceful form.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who can strip off his outer coat? Who can approach him with a bridle?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Who can open his jaws, ringed by his fearsome teeth?</verse>
  <verse number="15">His rows of scales are his pride, tightly sealed together.</verse>
  <verse number="16">One scale is so near to another that no air can pass between them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They are joined to one another; they clasp and cannot be separated.</verse>
  <verse number="18">His snorting flashes with light, and his eyes are like the rays of dawn.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Firebrands stream from his mouth; fiery sparks shoot forth!</verse>
  <verse number="20">Smoke billows from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over burning reeds.</verse>
  <verse number="21">His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames pour from his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Strength resides in his neck, and dismay leaps before him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.</verse>
  <verse number="24">His chest is as hard as a rock, as hard as a lower millstone!</verse>
  <verse number="25">When Leviathan rises up, the mighty are terrified; they withdraw before his thrashing.</verse>
  <verse number="26">The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or dart or arrow.</verse>
  <verse number="27">He regards iron as straw and bronze as rotten wood.</verse>
  <verse number="28">No arrow can make him flee; slingstones become like chaff to him.</verse>
  <verse number="29">A club is regarded as straw, and he laughs at the sound of the lance.</verse>
  <verse number="30">His undersides are jagged potsherds, spreading out the mud like a threshing sledge.</verse>
  <verse number="31">He makes the depths seethe like a cauldron; he makes the sea like a jar of ointment.</verse>
  <verse number="32">He leaves a glistening wake behind him; one would think the deep had white hair!</verse>
  <verse number="33">Nothing on earth is his equal—a creature devoid of fear!</verse>
  <verse number="34">He looks down on all the haughty; he is king over all the proud.”</verse>
