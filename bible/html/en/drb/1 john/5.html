<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God. And every one that loveth him who begot, loveth him also who is born of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">In this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God, and keep his commandments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For this is the charity of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not heavy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For whatsoever is born of God, overcometh the world: and this is the victory which overcometh the world, our faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus Christ: not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit which testifieth, that Christ is the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And there are three who give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these three are one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And there are three that give testimony on earth: the spirit, and the water, and the blood: and these three are one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater. For this is the testimony of God, which is greater, because he hath testified of his Son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He that believeth in the Son of God, hath the testimony of God in himself. He that believeth not the Son, maketh him a liar: because he believeth not in the testimony which God hath testified of his Son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And this is the testimony, that God hath given to us eternal life. And this life is in his Son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He that hath the Son, hath life. He that hath not the Son, hath not life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">These things I write to you, that you may know that you have eternal life, you who believe in the name of the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And this is the confidence which we have towards him: That, whatsoever we shall ask according to his will, he heareth us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask: we know that we have the petitions which we request of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He that knoweth his brother to sin a sin which is not to death, let him ask, and life shall be given to him, who sinneth not to death. There is a sin unto death: for that I say not that any man ask.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">All iniquity is sin. And there is a sin unto death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">We know that whosoever is born of God, sinneth not: but the generation of God preserveth him, and the wicked one toucheth him not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">We know that we are of God, and the whole world is seated in wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And we know that the Son of God is come: and he hath given us understanding that we may know the true God, and may be in his true Son. This is the true God and life eternal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.</p>
