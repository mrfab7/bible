<chapter book="Jeremiah" number="20" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now Pashhur the son of Immer the priest, who was chief officer in the house of the LORD, heard Jeremiah prophesying these things.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Then Pashhur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in the house of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashhur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The LORD hath not called thy name Pashhur, but Magor-missabib.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it: and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive to Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Moreover I will give all the riches of this city, and all the gains thereof, and all the precious things thereof, yea, all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And thou, Pashhur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and there shalt thou be buried, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied falsely.</verse>
  <verse number="7">O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am become a laughingstock all the day, every one mocketh me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and spoil: because the word of the LORD is made a reproach unto me, and a derision, all the day.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And if I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name, then there is in mine heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I cannot contain.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every side. Denounce, and we will denounce him, say all my familiar friends, they that watch for my halting; peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But the LORD is with me as a mighty one and a terrible: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed, because they have not dealt wisely, even with an everlasting dishonour which shall never be forgotten.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, that seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them; for unto thee have I revealed my cause.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Sing unto the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evil-doers.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Cursed be the day wherein I was born: let not the day wherein my mother bare me be blessed.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear a cry in the morning, and shouting at noontide;</verse>
  <verse number="17">because he slew me not from the womb; and so my mother should have been my grave, and her womb always great.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Wherefore came I forth out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?</verse>
