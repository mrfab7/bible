<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">John came, who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And there went out unto him all the country of Judæa, and all they of Jerusalem; and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and had a leathern girdle about his loins, and did eat locusts and wild honey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he preached, saying, There cometh after me he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I baptized you in water; but he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rent asunder, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and a voice came out of the heavens, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And straightway the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Now after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe in the gospel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And straightway they left the nets, and followed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And going on a little further, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And they go into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And they were astonished at his teaching: for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus thou Nazarene? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And straightway, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever; and straightway they tell him of her:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with demons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And all the city was gathered together at the door.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many demons; and he suffered not the demons to speak, because they knew him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And Simon and they that were with him followed after him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">and they found him, and say unto him, All are seeking thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And he saith unto them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end came I forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And there cometh to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou made clean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And straightway the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And he strictly charged him, and straightway sent him out,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</p>
