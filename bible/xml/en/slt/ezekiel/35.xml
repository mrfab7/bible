  <verse number="1">And the word of the Lord will be to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And say to it, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against thee, O mount Seir; and I stretched out my hand upon thee a desolation and an amazement.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I will set thy cities a waste, and thou shalt be a desolation, and thou knewest that I am Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Because there was a perpetual enmity to thee, and thou wilt pour out the sons of Israel by the hands of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time of iniquity the end:</verse>
  <verse number="6">For this, I live, says the Lord Jehovah, for I will make thee for blood and blood shall pursue thee: since thou hatedst not blood, and blood shall pursue thee.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And I gave mount Seir for a desolation, and desolation, and I cut off from it him passing through and him turning back.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And I filled his mountains with his wounded: in thy hills and in thy valleys, and all thy torrents the wounded of the sword shall fall in them:</verse>
  <verse number="9">I will give thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not be inhabited: and ye knew that I am Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Because of thy saying, The two nations and the two lands shall be to me, and we will possess it; and Jehovah was there:</verse>
  <verse number="11">For this, I live, says the Lord Jehovah, and I did according to thine anger and according to thine envy which thou didst in thy hatred against them; and I was known among them according to that I will judge thee.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And thou knewest that I am Jehovah; I heard all thy reproaches which thou spakest against the mountains of Israel, saying, They were given to us a desolation to consume.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And ye will be magnified against me with your mouth, and ye multiplied your words against me: I heard.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: When all the earth rejoiced I will make thee a desolation.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For thy rejoicing at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was a desolation, thus will I do to thee: thou shalt be a desolation O mount Seir, and all Edom, all of it: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.</verse>
