  <verse number="1">Brothers, my heart’s desire and my prayer to God is for Israel, that they may be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they didn’t subject themselves to the righteousness of God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For Christ is the fulfillment of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For Moses writes about the righteousness of the law, “The one who does them will live by them.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">But the righteousness which is of faith says this, “Don’t say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’ (that is, to bring Christ down);</verse>
  <verse number="7">or, ‘Who will descend into the abyss?’ (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)”</verse>
  <verse number="8">But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth, and in your heart;” that is, the word of faith, which we preach:</verse>
  <verse number="9">that if you will confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For with the heart, one believes unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes in him will not be disappointed.”</verse>
  <verse number="12">For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich to all who call on him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For, “Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in him whom they have not heard? How will they hear without a preacher?</verse>
  <verse number="15">And how will they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the Good News of peace, who bring glad tidings of good things!”</verse>
  <verse number="16">But they didn’t all listen to the glad news. For Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?”</verse>
  <verse number="17">So faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But I say, didn’t they hear? Yes, most certainly, “Their sound went out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.”</verse>
  <verse number="19">But I ask, didn’t Israel know? First Moses says, “I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, with a nation void of understanding I will make you angry.”</verse>
  <verse number="20">Isaiah is very bold, and says, “I was found by those who didn’t seek me. I was revealed to those who didn’t ask for me.”</verse>
  <verse number="21">But as to Israel he says, “All day long I stretched out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people.”</verse>
