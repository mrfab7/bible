  <verse number="1">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">How long wilt thou speak these things, Seeing that the words of thy mouth are as a mighty wind?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Doth God pervert judgment? Or doth the Almighty pervert justice?</verse>
  <verse number="4">If thy children sinned against Him, He delivered them into the hand of their transgression.</verse>
  <verse number="5">If thou wouldest seek earnestly unto God, And make thy supplication to the Almighty;</verse>
  <verse number="6">If thou wert pure and upright; Surely now He would awake for thee, And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And though thy beginning was small, Yet thy end should greatly increase.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For inquire, I pray thee, of the former generation, And apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out—</verse>
  <verse number="9">For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, Because our days upon earth are a shadow—</verse>
  <verse number="10">Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, And utter words out of their heart?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Can the rush shoot up without mire? Can the reed-grass grow without water?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Whilst it is yet in its greenness, and not cut down, It withereth before any other herb.</verse>
  <verse number="13">So are the paths of all that forget God; And the hope of the godless man shall perish;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Whose confidence is gossamer, And whose trust is a spider’s web.</verse>
  <verse number="15">He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand; He shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure.</verse>
  <verse number="16">He is green before the sun, And his shoots go forth over his garden.</verse>
  <verse number="17">His roots are wrapped about the heap, He beholdeth the place of stones.</verse>
  <verse number="18">If he be destroyed from his place, Then it shall deny him: ‘I have not seen thee.’</verse>
  <verse number="19">Behold, this is the joy of his way, And out of the earth shall others spring.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Behold, God will not cast away an innocent man, Neither will He uphold the evil-doers;</verse>
  <verse number="21">Till He fill thy mouth with laughter, And thy lips with shouting.</verse>
  <verse number="22">They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; And the tent of the wicked shall be no more.</verse>
