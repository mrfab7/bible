<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How hast thou helped the powerless; how saved the arm that is without strength!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom, and abundantly declared the thing as it is!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The shades tremble beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Sheol is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He stretcheth out the north over empty space, he hangeth the earth upon nothing;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not rent under them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He covereth the face of his throne, he spreadeth his cloud upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He hath traced a fixed circle over the waters, unto the confines of light and darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The pillars of the heavens tremble and are astonished at his rebuke.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He stirreth up the sea by his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">By his Spirit the heavens are adorned; his hand hath formed the fleeing serpent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Lo, these are the borders of his ways; but what a whisper of a word do we hear of him! And the thunder of his power, who can understand?</p>
