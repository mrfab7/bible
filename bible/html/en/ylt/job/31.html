<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="31" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A covenant I made for mine eyes, And what—do I attend to a virgin?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And what is the portion of God from above? And the inheritance of the Mighty from the heights?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is not calamity to the perverse? And strangeness to workers of iniquity?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Doth not He see my ways, And all my steps number?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If I have walked with vanity, And my foot doth hasten to deceit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He doth weigh me in righteous balances, And God doth know my integrity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If my step doth turn aside from the way, And after mine eyes hath my heart gone, And to my hands cleaved hath blemish,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Let me sow—and another eat, And my products let be rooted out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">If my heart hath been enticed by woman, And by the opening of my neighbour I laid wait,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Grind to another let my wife, And over her let others bend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For it is a wicked thing, and a judicial iniquity;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For a fire it is, to destruction it consumeth, And among all mine increase doth take root,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I despise the cause of my man-servant, And of my handmaid, In their contending with me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then what do I do when God ariseth? And when He doth inspect, What do I answer Him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Did not He that made me in the womb make him? Yea, prepare us in the womb doth One.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If I withhold from pleasure the poor, And the eyes of the widow do consume,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And I do eat my morsel by myself, And the orphan hath not eat of it,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">(But from my youth He grew up with me as with a father, And from the belly of my mother I am led.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If I see any perishing without clothing, And there is no covering to the needy,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">If his loins have not blessed me, And from the fleece of my sheep He doth not warm himself,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">If I have waved at the fatherless my hand, When I see in him the gate of my court,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">My shoulder from its blade let fall, And mine arm from the bone be broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For a dread unto me is calamity from God, And because of His excellency I am not able.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">If I have made gold my confidence, And to the pure gold have said, ‘My trust,’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If I rejoice because great is my wealth, And because abundance hath my hand found,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">If I see the light when it shineth, And the precious moon walking,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And my heart is enticed in secret, And my hand doth kiss my mouth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">It also is a judicial iniquity, For I had lied to God above.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">If I rejoice at the ruin of my hater, And stirred up myself when evil found him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Yea, I have not suffered my mouth to sin, To ask with an oath his life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">If not—say ye, O men of my tent, ‘O that we had of his flesh, we are not satisfied.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">In the street doth not lodge a stranger, My doors to the traveller I open.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If I have covered as Adam my transgressions, To hide in my bosom mine iniquity,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Because I fear a great multitude, And the contempt of families doth affright me, Then I am silent, I go not out of the opening.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Who giveth to me a hearing? lo, my mark. The Mighty One doth answer me, And a bill hath mine adversary written.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">If not—on my shoulder I take it up, I bind it a crown on myself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">The number of my steps I tell Him, As a leader I approach Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">If against me my land doth cry out, And together its furrows weep,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">If its strength I consumed without money, And the life of its possessors, I have caused to breathe out,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Instead of wheat let a thorn go forth, And instead of barley a useless weed! The words of Job are finished.</p>
