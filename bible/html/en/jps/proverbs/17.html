<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="17" data-translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" data-translation-id="jps" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Better is a dry morsel and quietness therewith, Than a house full of feasting with strife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A servant that dealeth wisely shall have rule over a son that dealeth shamefully, And shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold; But the LORD trieth the hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A evil-doer giveth heed to wicked lips; And a liar giveth ear to a mischievous tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Whoso mocketh the poor blasphemeth his Maker; And he that is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Childrenâ€™s children are the crown of old men; And the glory of children are their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Overbearing speech becometh not a churl; Much less do lying lips a prince.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it; Whithersoever he turneth, he prospereth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; But he that harpeth on a matter estrangeth a familiar friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A rebuke entereth deeper into a man of understanding Than a hundred stripes into a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">A rebellious man seeketh only evil; Therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, Rather than a fool in his folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whoso rewardeth evil for good, Evil shall not depart from his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water; Therefore leave off contention, before the quarrel break out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the righteous, Even they both are an abomination to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool To buy wisdom, seeing he hath no understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A friend loveth at all times, And a brother is born for adversity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">A man void of understanding is he that striketh hands, And becometh surety in the presence of his neighbour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He loveth transgression that loveth strife; He that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He that hath a froward heart findeth no good; And he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow; And the father of a churl hath no joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A merry heart is a good medicine; But a broken spirit drieth the bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom, To pervert the ways of justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; But the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">A foolish son is vexation to his father, And bitterness to her that bore him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">To punish also the righteous is not good, Nor to strike the noble for their uprightness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He that spareth his words hath knowledge; And he that husbandeth his spirit is a man of discernment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise; And he that shutteth his lips is esteemed as a man of understanding.</p>
