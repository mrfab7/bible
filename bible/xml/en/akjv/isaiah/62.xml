  <verse number="1">For Zion’s sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burns.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the Gentiles shall see your righteousness, and all kings your glory: and you shall be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name.</verse>
  <verse number="3">You shall also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">You shall no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall your land any more be termed Desolate: but you shall be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah: for the LORD delights in you, and your land shall be married.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For as a young man marries a virgin, so shall your sons marry you: and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall your God rejoice over you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I have set watchmen on your walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night: you that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence,</verse>
  <verse number="7">And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The LORD has sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give your corn to be meat for your enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink your wine, for the which you have labored:</verse>
  <verse number="9">But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the LORD; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Go through, go through the gates; prepare you the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the end of the world, Say you to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your salvation comes; behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD: and you shall be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.</verse>
