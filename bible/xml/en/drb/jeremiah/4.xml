  <verse number="3">For thus saith the Lord to the men of Juda and Jerusalem: Break up anew your fallow ground, and sow not upon thorns:</verse>
  <verse number="4">Be circumcised to the Lord, and take away the foreskins of your hearts, ye men of Juda, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my indignation come forth like fire, and burn, and there be none that can quench it: because of the wickedness of your thoughts.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Declare ye in Juda, and make it heard in Jerusalem: speak, and sound with the trumpet in the land: cry aloud, and say: Assemble yourselves, and let us go into strong cities.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Set up the standard in Sion. Strengthen yourselves, stay not: for I bring evil from the north, and great destruction.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The lion is come up out of his den, and the robber of nations hath roused himself: he is come forth out of his place, to make thy land desolate: thy cities shall be laid waste, remaining without an inhabitant.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For this gird yourselves with haircloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the Lord is not turned away from us.</verse>

  <verse number="11">At that time it shall be said to this people, and to Jerusalem: A burning wind is in the ways that are in the desert of the way of the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse.</verse>
  <verse number="12">A full wind from these places shall come to me: and now I will speak my judgments with them.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Behold he shall come up as a cloud, and his chariots as a tempest: his horses are swifter than eagles: woe unto us, for we are laid waste.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Wash thy heart from wickedness, O Jerusalem, that thou mayst be saved: how long shall hurtful thoughts abide in thee?</verse>
  <verse number="15">For a voice of one declaring from Dan, and giving notice of the idol from mount Ephraim.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Say ye to the nations: Behold it is heard in Jerusalem, that guards are coming from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Juda.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They are set round about her, as keepers of fields: because she hath provoked me to wrath, saith the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Thy ways, and thy devices have brought these things upon thee: this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it hath touched thy heart.</verse>
  <verse number="19">My bowels, my bowels are in pain, the senses of my heart are troubled within me, I will not hold my peace, for my soul hath heard the sound of the trumpet, the cry of battle.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Destruction upon destruction is called for, and all the earth is laid waste: my tents are destroyed on a sudden, and my pavilions in a moment.</verse>
  <verse number="21">How long shall I see men fleeing away, how long shall I hear the sound of the trumpet?</verse>
  <verse number="22">For my foolish people have not known me: they are foolish and senseless children: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="23">I beheld the earth, and lo it was void, and nothing: and the heavens, and there was no light in them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">I looked upon the mountains, and behold they trembled: and all the hills were troubled.</verse>
  <verse number="25">I beheld, and lo there was no man: and all the birds of the air were gone.</verse>
  <verse number="26">I looked, and behold Carmel was a wilderness: and all its cities were destroyed at the presence of the Lord, and at the presence of the wrath of his indignation.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For thus saith the Lord: All the land shall be desolate, but yet I will not utterly destroy.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The earth shall mourn, and the heavens shall lament from above: because I have spoken, I have purposed, and I have not repented, neither am I turned away from it.</verse>
  <verse number="29">At the voice of the horsemen, and the archers, all the city is fled away; they have entered into thickets and have climbed up the rocks: all the cities are forsaken, and there dwelleth not a man in them.</verse>
  <verse number="30">But when thou art spoiled what wilt thou do? though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, and paintest thy eyes with stibic stone, thou shalt dress thyself out in vain: thy lovers have despised thee, they will seek thy life.</verse>
  <verse number="31">For I have heard the voice as of a woman in travail, anguishes as of a woman in labor of a child. The voice of the daughter of Sion, dying away, spreading her hands: Woe is me, for my soul hath fainted because of them that are slain.</verse>
