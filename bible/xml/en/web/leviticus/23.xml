  <verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘The set feasts of Yahweh, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my set feasts.</verse>
  <verse number="3">“‘Six days shall work be done: but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; you shall do no kind of work. It is a Sabbath to Yahweh in all your dwellings.</verse>
  <verse number="4">“‘These are the set feasts of Yahweh, even holy convocations, which you shall proclaim in their appointed season.</verse>
  <verse number="5">In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening, is Yahweh’s Passover.</verse>
  <verse number="6">On the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread to Yahweh. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.</verse>
  <verse number="7">In the first day you shall have a holy convocation. You shall do no regular work.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh seven days. In the seventh day is a holy convocation: you shall do no regular work.’”</verse>
  <verse number="9">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="10">“Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, ‘When you have come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap its the harvest, then you shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest:</verse>
  <verse number="11">and he shall wave the sheaf before Yahweh, to be accepted for you. On the next day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">On the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb without blemish a year old for a burnt offering to Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The meal offering with it shall be two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire to Yahweh for a pleasant aroma; and the drink offering with it shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.</verse>
  <verse number="14">You shall eat neither bread, nor roasted grain, nor fresh grain, until this same day, until you have brought the offering of your God. This is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</verse>
  <verse number="15">“‘You shall count from the next day after the Sabbath, from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering; seven Sabbaths shall be completed:</verse>
  <verse number="16">even to the next day after the seventh Sabbath you shall number fifty days; and you shall offer a new meal offering to Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="17">You shall bring out of your habitations two loaves of bread for a wave offering made of two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour. They shall be baked with yeast, for first fruits to Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="18">You shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish a year old, one young bull, and two rams. They shall be a burnt offering to Yahweh, with their meal offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet aroma to Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="19">You shall offer one male goat for a sin offering, and two male lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace offerings.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits for a wave offering before Yahweh, with the two lambs. They shall be holy to Yahweh for the priest.</verse>
  <verse number="21">You shall make proclamation on the same day: there shall be a holy convocation to you; you shall do no regular work. This is a statute forever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.</verse>
  <verse number="22">“‘When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap into the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest: you shall leave them for the poor, and for the foreigner. I am Yahweh your God.’”</verse>
  <verse number="23">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="24">“Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest to you, a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.</verse>
  <verse number="25">You shall do no regular work; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh.’”</verse>
  <verse number="26">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="27">“However on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement: it shall be a holy convocation to you, and you shall afflict yourselves; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="28">You shall do no kind of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before Yahweh your God.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For whoever it is who shall not deny himself in that same day; shall be cut off from his people.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Whoever it is who does any kind of work in that same day, that person I will destroy from among his people.</verse>
  <verse number="31">You shall do no kind of work: it is a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</verse>
  <verse number="32">It shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for you, and you shall deny yourselves. In the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening, you shall keep your Sabbath.”</verse>
  <verse number="33">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="34">“Speak to the children of Israel, and say, ‘On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tents for seven days to Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="35">On the first day shall be a holy convocation: you shall do no regular work.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh. On the eighth day shall be a holy convocation to you; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh. It is a solemn assembly; you shall do no regular work.</verse>
  <verse number="37">“‘These are the appointed feasts of Yahweh, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh, a burnt offering, and a meal offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, each on its own day;</verse>
  <verse number="38">besides the Sabbaths of Yahweh, and besides your gifts, and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill offerings, which you give to Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="39">“‘So on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruits of the land, you shall keep the feast of Yahweh seven days: on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.</verse>
  <verse number="40">You shall take on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God seven days.</verse>
  <verse number="41">You shall keep it a feast to Yahweh seven days in the year: it is a statute forever throughout your generations; you shall keep it in the seventh month.</verse>
  <verse number="42">You shall dwell in booths seven days. All who are native-born in Israel shall dwell in booths,</verse>
  <verse number="43">that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I am Yahweh your God.’”</verse>
  <verse number="44">Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed feasts of Yahweh.</verse>
