  <verse number="1">The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and drop your word toward the sanctuaries, and prophesy against the land of Israel;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and tell the land of Israel, Thus says Yahweh: Behold, I am against you, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:</verse>
  <verse number="5">and all flesh shall know that I, Yahweh, have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath; it shall not return any more.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Sigh therefore, you son of man; with the breaking of your thighs and with bitterness you will sigh before their eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="7">It shall be, when they tell you, Why do you sigh? that you shall say, Because of the news, for it comes; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it comes, and it shall be done, says the Lord Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="9">Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says Yahweh: Say, A sword, a sword, it is sharpened, and also furbished;</verse>
  <verse number="10">it is sharpened that it may make a slaughter; it is furbished that it may be as lightning: shall we then make mirth? the rod of my son, it condemns every tree.</verse>
  <verse number="11">It is given to be furbished, that it may be handled: the sword, it is sharpened, yes, it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the killer.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Cry and wail, son of man; for it is on my people, it is on all the princes of Israel: they are delivered over to the sword with my people; strike therefore on your thigh.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For there is a trial; and what if even the rod that condemns shall be no more? says the Lord Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="14">You therefore, son of man, prophesy, and strike your hands together; and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the deadly wounded: it is the sword of the great one who is deadly wounded, which enters into their rooms.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I have set the threatening sword against all their gates, that their heart may melt, and their stumblings be multiplied: ah! it is made as lightning, it is pointed for slaughter.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Gather yourselves together, go to the right, set yourselves in array, go to the left, wherever your face is set.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I will also strike my hands together, and I will cause my wrath to rest: I, Yahweh, have spoken it.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The word of Yahweh came to me again, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="19">Also, you son of man, appoint two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come; they both shall come forth out of one land: and mark out a place, mark it out at the head of the way to the city.</verse>
  <verse number="20">You shall appoint a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and to Judah in Jerusalem the fortified.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he shook the arrows back and forth, he consulted the teraphim, he looked in the liver.</verse>
  <verse number="22">In his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build forts.</verse>
  <verse number="23">It shall be to them as a false divination in their sight, who have sworn oaths to them; but he brings iniquity to memory, that they may be taken.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear; because you have come to memory, you shall be taken with the hand.</verse>
  <verse number="25">You, deadly wounded wicked one, the prince of Israel, whose day has come, in the time of the iniquity of the end,</verse>
  <verse number="26">thus says the Lord Yahweh: Remove the turban, and take off the crown; this shall be no more the same; exalt that which is low, and abase that which is high.</verse>
  <verse number="27">I will overturn, overturn, overturn it: this also shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.</verse>
  <verse number="28">You, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach; and say, A sword, a sword is drawn, for the slaughter it is furbished, to cause it to devour, that it may be as lightning;</verse>
  <verse number="29">while they see for you false visions, while they divine lies to you, to lay you on the necks of the wicked who are deadly wounded, whose day has come in the time of the iniquity of the end.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Cause it to return into its sheath. In the place where you were created, in the land of your birth, will I judge you.</verse>
  <verse number="31">I will pour out my indignation on you; I will blow on you with the fire of my wrath; and I will deliver you into the hand of brutish men, skillful to destroy.</verse>
  <verse number="32">You shall be for fuel to the fire; your blood shall be in the midst of the land; you shall be remembered no more: for I, Yahweh, have spoken it.</verse>
