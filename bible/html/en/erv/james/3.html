<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Be not many teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive heavier judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For in many things we all stumble. If any stumbleth not in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Now if we put the horses’ bridles into their mouths, that they may obey us, we turn about their whole body also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Behold, the ships also, though they are so great, and are driven by rough winds, are yet turned about by a very small rudder, whither the impulse of the steersman willeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">So the tongue also is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how much wood is kindled by how small a fire!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For every kind of beasts and birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">but the tongue can no man tame; it is a restless evil, it is full of deadly poison.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Therewith bless we the Lord and Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the likeness of God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Doth the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet water and bitter?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Can a fig tree, my brethren, yield olives, or a vine figs? neither can salt water yield sweet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who is wise and understanding among you? let him shew by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart, glory not and lie not against the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">This wisdom is not a wisdom that cometh down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For where jealousy and faction are, there is confusion and every vile deed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without variance, without hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace.</p>
