<chapter book="Ezekiel" number="31" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Son of man, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom are you like in your greatness?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches, and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was among the thick boughs.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her rivers running round about his plants, and sent her little rivers to all the trees of the field.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.</verse>
  <verse number="6">All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their young, and under his shadow dwelled all great nations.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his branches: for his root was by great waters.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like to him in his beauty.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Because you have lifted up yourself in height, and he has shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;</verse>
  <verse number="11">I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for his wickedness.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off, and have left him: on the mountains and in all the valleys his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">On his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be on his branches:</verse>
  <verse number="14">To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink water: for they are all delivered to death, to the nether parts of the earth, in the middle of the children of men, with them that go down to the pit.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thus said the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water, shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They also went down into hell with him to them that be slain with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelled under his shadow in the middle of the heathen.</verse>
  <verse number="18">To whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shall you be brought down with the trees of Eden to the nether parts of the earth: you shall lie in the middle of the uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, said the Lord GOD.</verse>
