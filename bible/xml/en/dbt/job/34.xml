<chapter book="Job" number="34" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Moreover Elihu answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hear my words, ye wise [men]; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the ear trieth words, as the palate tasteth food.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Let us choose for ourselves what is right; let us know among ourselves what is good!</verse>
  <verse number="5">For Job hath said, I am righteous, and God hath taken away my judgment:</verse>
  <verse number="6">Should I lie against my right? My wound is incurable without transgression.</verse>
  <verse number="7">What man is like Job? he drinketh up scorning like water,</verse>
  <verse number="8">And goeth in company with workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For he hath said, It profiteth not a man if he delight himself in God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: Far be wickedness from God, and wrong from the Almighty!</verse>
  <verse number="11">For a man’s work will he render to him, and cause every one to find according to [his] way.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Yea, surely, God acteth not wickedly, and the Almighty perverteth not judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who hath entrusted to him the earth? and who hath disposed the whole world?</verse>
  <verse number="14">If he only thought of himself, [and] gathered unto him his spirit and his breath,</verse>
  <verse number="15">All flesh would expire together, and man would return to the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If now [thou hast] understanding, hear this: give ear to the voice of my words!</verse>
  <verse number="17">Should he that hateth right indeed govern? and wilt thou condemn the All-just?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Shall one say to a king, Belial? to nobles, Wicked?</verse>
  <verse number="19">[How then to him] that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich man more than the poor? for they are all the work of his hands.</verse>
  <verse number="20">In a moment they die, even at midnight the people are convulsed and pass away; and the strong are taken away without hand.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his steps.</verse>
  <verse number="22">There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For he doth not long consider a man, to bring him before God in judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He breaketh in pieces mighty men without inquiry, and setteth others in their stead;</verse>
  <verse number="25">Since he knoweth their actions; and he overthroweth [them] in the night, and they are crushed.</verse>
  <verse number="26">He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others,</verse>
  <verse number="27">Because they have turned back from him, and would consider none of his ways;</verse>
  <verse number="28">So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</verse>
  <verse number="29">When he giveth quietness, who then will disturb? and when he hideth [his] face, who shall behold him? and this towards a nation, or towards a man alike;</verse>
  <verse number="30">That the ungodly man reign not, that the people be not ensnared.</verse>
  <verse number="31">For hath he said unto God, I bear [chastisement], I will not offend;</verse>
  <verse number="32">What I see not, teach thou me; if I have done wrong, I will do so no more?</verse>
  <verse number="33">Shall he recompense according to thy mind? for thou hast refused [his judgment]; for thou so choosest, and not I; speak then what thou knowest.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Men of understanding will say to me, and a wise man who heareth me:</verse>
  <verse number="35">Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were not with intelligence.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Would that Job may be tried unto the end, because of [his] answers after the manner of evil men!</verse>
  <verse number="37">For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth [his hands] among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</verse>
