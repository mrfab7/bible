<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And he made a brazen altar: its length was twenty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits, and its height ten cubits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he made the sea, molten, ten cubits from brim to brim, round all about; and its height was five cubits; and a line of thirty cubits encompassed it round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And under it was the similitude of oxen, encompassing it round about, ten in a cubit enclosing the sea round about, two rows of oxen, cast when it was cast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east; and the sea was above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And its thickness was a hand-breadth, and its brim like the work of the brim of a cup, with lily-blossoms; in capacity it held three thousand baths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he made ten lavers, and put five on the right and five on the left, to wash in them: they rinsed in them what they prepared for the burnt-offering; and the sea was for the priests to wash in.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to the ordinance respecting them, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand and five on the left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he made ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right hand and five on the left. And he made a hundred golden bowls.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors thereof with bronze.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he set the sea on the right side eastward, over against the south.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Huram made the pots and the shovels and the bowls. So Huram ended doing the work that he made for king Solomon in the house of God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">two pillars, and the globes and the capitals on the top of the pillars, two; and the two networks, to cover the two globes of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two globes of the capitals which were upon the pillars.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he made the bases, and he made the lavers on the bases;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">one sea, and the twelve oxen under it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the pots, and the shovels, and the forks, and all their instruments did Huram Abiv make king Solomon for the house of Jehovah, of bright brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay-ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Solomon made all these vessels in great number; for the weight of the brass was not ascertained.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Solomon made all the vessels that were [in] the house of God: the golden altar; and the tables whereon was the shewbread;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">and the candlesticks with their lamps to burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold (it was perfect gold);</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">and the knives, and the bowls, and the cups, and the censers, of pure gold; and the entrance of the house, the inner folding-doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house, of the temple, of gold.</p>
