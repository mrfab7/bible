<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Then I asked, “Where are you going?” He said to me, “To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth and what is its length.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Behold, the angel who talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and said to him, “Run, speak to this young man, saying, ‘Jerusalem will be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of men and livestock in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For I,’ says Yahweh, ‘will be to her a wall of fire around it, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,’ says Yahweh; ‘for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the sky,’ says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">‘Come, Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For thus says Yahweh of Armies: ‘For honor he has sent me to the nations which plundered you; for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they will be a spoil to those who served them; and you will know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion; for, behold, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of you,’ says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Many nations shall join themselves to Yahweh in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell in the midst of you, and you shall know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Yahweh will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Be silent, all flesh, before Yahweh; for he has roused himself from his holy habitation!”</p>
