<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="7" data-translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" data-translation-id="jps" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Is there not a time of service to man upon earth? And are not his days like the days of a hireling?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As a servant that eagerly longeth for the shadow, And as a hireling that looketh for his wages;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">So am I made to possess—months of vanity, And wearisome nights are appointed to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">When I lie down, I say: ‘When shall I arise?’ But the night is long, and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; My skin closeth up and breaketh out afresh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, And are spent without hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">O remember that my life is a breath; Mine eye shall no more see good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more; While Thine eyes are upon me, I am gone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, So he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He shall return no more to his house, Neither shall his place know him any more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, That Thou settest a watch over me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">When I say: ‘My bed shall comfort me, My couch shall ease my complaint’;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then Thou scarest me with dreams, And terrifiest me through visions;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">So that my soul chooseth strangling, And death rather than these my bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I loathe it; I shall not live alway; Let me alone; for my days are vanity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">What is man, that Thou shouldest magnify him, And that Thou shouldest set Thy heart upon him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And that Thou shouldest remember him every morning, And try him every moment?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">How long wilt Thou not look away from me, Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">If I have sinned, what do I unto Thee, O Thou watcher of men? Why hast Thou set me as a mark for Thee, So that I am a burden to myself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And why dost Thou not pardon my transgression, And take away mine iniquity? For now shall I lie down in the dust; And Thou wilt seek me, but I shall not be.</p>
