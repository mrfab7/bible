  <verse number="1">And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the children of Israel said to them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for you have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then said the LORD to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, At even, then you shall know that the LORD has brought you out from the land of Egypt:</verse>
  <verse number="7">And in the morning, then you shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he hears your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that you murmur against us?</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Moses said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD hears your murmurings which you murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he has heard your murmurings.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="12">I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: speak to them, saying, At even you shall eat flesh, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, on the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they knew not what it was. And Moses said to them, This is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat.</verse>
  <verse number="16">This is the thing which the LORD has commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take you every man for them which are in his tents.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Notwithstanding they listened not to Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and Moses was wroth with them.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he said to them, This is that which the LORD has said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath to the LORD: bake that which you will bake to day, and seethe that you will seethe; and that which remains over lay up for you to be kept until the morning.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And Moses said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath to the LORD: to day you shall not find it in the field.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Six days you shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the LORD said to Moses, How long refuse you to keep my commandments and my laws?</verse>
  <verse number="29">See, for that the LORD has given you the sabbath, therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide you every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day.</verse>
  <verse number="30">So the people rested on the seventh day.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commands, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread with which I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations.</verse>
  <verse number="34">As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the children of Israel did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.</verse>
