  <verse number="3">Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.</verse>
  <verse number="4">It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes to say, Where is strong drink?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any that is afflicted.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto the bitter in soul:</verse>
  <verse number="7">Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Open thy mouth for the dumb, in the cause of all such as are left desolate.</verse>

  <verse number="14">She is like the merchant-ships; she bringeth her food from afar.</verse>
  <verse number="15">She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and their task to her maidens.</verse>
  <verse number="16">She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.</verse>
  <verse number="17">She girdeth her loins with strength, and maketh strong her arms.</verse>
  <verse number="18">She perceiveth that her merchandise is profitable: her lamp goeth not out by night.</verse>
  <verse number="19">She layeth her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.</verse>
  <verse number="20">She spreadeth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.</verse>
  <verse number="21">She is not afraid of the snow for her household; for all her household are clothed with scarlet.</verse>
  <verse number="22">She maketh for herself carpets of tapestry; her clothing is fine linen and purple.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="24">She maketh linen garments and selleth them; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Strength and dignity are her clothing; and she laugheth at the time to come.</verse>
  <verse number="26">She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and the law of kindness is on her tongue.</verse>

  <verse number="28">Her children rise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="29">Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her works praise her in the gates.</verse>
