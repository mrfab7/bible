  <verse number="1">How is the gold become dim, Changed the best—the pure gold? Poured out are stones of the sanctuary At the head of all out-places.</verse>
  <verse number="2">The precious sons of Zion, Who are comparable with fine gold, How have they been reckoned earthen bottles, Work of the hands of a potter.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Even dragons have drawn out the breast, They have suckled their young ones, The daughter of my people is become cruel, Like the ostriches in a wilderness.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Cleaved hath the tongue of a suckling unto his palate with thirst, Infants asked bread, a dealer out they have none.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Those eating of dainties have been desolate in out-places, Those supported on scarlet have embraced dunghills.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And greater is the iniquity of the daughter of my people, Than the sin of Sodom, That was overturned as in a moment, And no hands were stayed on her.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Purer were her Nazarites than snow, Whiter than milk, ruddier of body than rubies, Of sapphire their form.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Darker than blackness hath been their visage, They have not been known in out-places, Cleaved hath their skin unto their bone, It hath withered—it hath been as wood.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Better have been the pierced of a sword Than the pierced of famine, For these flow away, pierced through, Without the increase of the field.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The hands of merciful women have boiled their own children, They have been for food to them, In the destruction of the daughter of my people.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Completed hath Jehovah His fury, He hath poured out the fierceness of His anger, And he kindleth a fire in Zion, And it devoureth her foundations.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Believe not did the kings of earth, And any of the inhabitants of the world, That come would an adversary and enemy Into the gates of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Because of the sins of her prophets, The iniquities of her priests, Who are shedding in her midst the blood of the righteous,</verse>
  <verse number="14">They have wandered naked in out-places, They have been polluted with blood, Without any being able to touch their clothing,</verse>
  <verse number="15">‘Turn aside—unclean,’ they called to them, ‘Turn aside, turn aside, touch not,’ For they fled—yea, they have wandered, They have said among nations: ‘They do not add to sojourn.’</verse>
  <verse number="16">The face of Jehovah hath divided them, He doth not add to behold them, The face of priests they have not lifted up, Elders they have not favoured.</verse>
  <verse number="17">While we exist—consumed are our eyes for our vain help, In our watch-tower we have watched for a nation that saveth not.</verse>
  <verse number="18">They have hunted our steps from going in our broad-places, Near hath been our end, fulfilled our days, For come hath our end.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Swifter have been our pursuers, Than the eagles of the heavens, On the mountains they have burned after us, In the wilderness they have laid wait for us.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The breath of our nostrils—the anointed of Jehovah, Hath been captured in their pits, of whom we said: ‘In his shadow we do live among nations.’</verse>
  <verse number="21">Joy and rejoice, O daughter of Edom, Dwelling in the land of Uz, Even unto thee pass over doth a cup, Thou art drunk, and makest thyself naked.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Completed is thy iniquity, daughter of Zion, He doth not add to remove thee, He hath inspected thy iniquity, O daughter of Edom, He hath removed thee because of thy sins!</verse>
