  <verse number="1">Call now; is there any that will answer thee? and to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?</verse>
  <verse number="2">For vexation killeth the foolish man, and jealousy slayeth the silly one.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</verse>
  <verse number="4">His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the snare gapeth for their substance.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</verse>
  <verse number="7">But man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But as for me, I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvelous things without number:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:</verse>
  <verse number="11">So that he setteth up on high those that be low; and those which mourn are exalted to safety.</verse>
  <verse number="12">He frustrateth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.</verse>
  <verse number="14">They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope at noonday as in the night.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But he saveth from the sword of their mouth, even the needy from the hand of the mighty.</verse>
  <verse number="16">So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For he maketh sore, and bindeth up; he woundeth, and his hands make whole.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He shall deliver thee in six troubles; yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</verse>
  <verse number="20">In famine he shall redeem thee from death; and in war from the power of the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue; neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</verse>
  <verse number="22">At destruction and dearth thou shalt laugh; neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field; and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace; and thou shalt visit thy fold, and shalt miss nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in its season.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.</verse>
