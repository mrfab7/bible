<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="7" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that you are in our hearts to die and live with you.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fights, within were fears.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Nevertheless God, that comforts those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;</verse>
  <verse number="7">And not by his coming only, but by the consolation with which he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same letter has made you sorry, though it were but for a season.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that you sorrowed to repentance: for you were made sorry after a godly manner, that you might receive damage by us in nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world works death.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For behold this selfsame thing, that you sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it worked in you, yes, what clearing of yourselves, yes, what indignation, yes, what fear, yes, what vehement desire, yes, what zeal, yes, what revenge! In all things you have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Why, though I wrote to you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear to you.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yes, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.</verse>
