  <verse number="1">And concerning the collection for the holy ones, as I appointed to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.</verse>
  <verse number="2">According to one day of the sabbaths let each of you put by himself, treasuring up that which he is prospered in, that when I come there be no collections.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And when I be present, whom ye approve by letters, these will I send to carry your grace to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And if it be suitable for me also to go, they shall go with me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And I will come to you, when I pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And perhaps with you I shall abide, or also pass the winter, that ye might send me forward wherever I go.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For I will not see you now in coming forward; but I hope to remain some time with you, if the Lord permit.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And I will remain in Ephesus even till Pentecost.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For a door has stood open to me, great and effective, and many opposed.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And if Timotheus come, see ye that he be with you fearlessly: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Therefore no one should despise him: and send ye him forward in peace, that he might come to me: for I expect him with the brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And concerning Apollos, the brother, I besought him much that he would come to you with the brethren: and the will was not altogether that he should come now; and he will come when he should have leisure.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Watch ye, stand in the faith, be manly, be strengthened.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Let all things be in love.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And I beseech you brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and they arranged themselves for service to the holy ones,)</verse>
  <verse number="16">That also ye be subjected to such, and to every one cooperating, and to the wearied.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And I rejoice at the arrival of Stephanas and Fortunatus and: that they have filled up your necessity.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For they refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore observe ye such.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla, with the church at their house, greet you.</verse>
  <verse number="20">All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with a holy kiss.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The greeting of Paul by my hand.</verse>
  <verse number="22">If any love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ with you:</verse>
  <verse number="24">My love with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</verse>
