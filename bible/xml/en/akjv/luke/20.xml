  <verse number="1">And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came on him with the elders,</verse>
  <verse number="2">And spoke to him, saying, Tell us, by what authority do you these things? or who is he that gave you this authority?</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he answered and said to them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:</verse>
  <verse number="4">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?</verse>
  <verse number="5">And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed you him not?</verse>
  <verse number="6">But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that John was a prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they answered, that they could not tell from where it was.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Jesus said to them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then began he to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to farmers, and went into a far country for a long time.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And at the season he sent a servant to the farmers, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the farmers beat him, and sent him away empty.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</verse>
  <verse number="15">So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
  <verse number="16">He shall come and destroy these farmers, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, God forbid.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Whoever shall fall on that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governor.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that you say and teach rightly, neither accept you the person of any, but teach the way of God truly:</verse>
  <verse number="22">Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or no?</verse>
  <verse number="23">But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, Why tempt you me?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Show me a penny. Whose image and superscription has it? They answered and said, Caesar’s.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he said to them, Render therefore to Caesar the things which be Caesar’s, and to God the things which be God’s.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marveled at his answer, and held their peace.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,</verse>
  <verse number="28">Saying, Master, Moses wrote to us, If any man’s brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="29">There were therefore seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and died without children.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Last of all the woman died also.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Jesus answering said to them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:</verse>
  <verse number="35">But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</verse>
  <verse number="36">Neither can they die any more: for they are equal to the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="38">For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live to him.</verse>
  <verse number="39">Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, you have well said.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And after that they dared not ask him any question at all.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And he said to them, How say they that Christ is David’s son?</verse>
  <verse number="42">And David himself said in the book of Psalms, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you on my right hand,</verse>
  <verse number="43">Till I make your enemies your footstool.</verse>
  <verse number="44">David therefore calls him Lord, how is he then his son?</verse>
  <verse number="45">Then in the audience of all the people he said to his disciples,</verse>
  <verse number="46">Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts;</verse>
  <verse number="47">Which devour widows’ houses, and for a show make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.</verse>
