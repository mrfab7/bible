<chapter book="Colossians" number="3" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">If then ye were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are upon the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For ye died, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">When Christ, who is our life, shall be manifested, then shall ye also with him be manifested in glory.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Put to death therefore your members which are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;</verse>
  <verse number="6">for which things’ sake cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience:</verse>
  <verse number="7">wherein ye also once walked, when ye lived in these things;</verse>
  <verse number="8">but now do ye also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, railing, shameful speaking out of your mouth:</verse>
  <verse number="9">lie not one to another; seeing that ye have put off the old man with his doings,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and have put on the new man, that is being renewed unto knowledge after the image of him that created him:</verse>
  <verse number="11">where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Christ is all, and in all.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Put on therefore, as God’s elect, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering;</verse>
  <verse number="13">forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any man have a complaint against any; even as the Lord forgave you, so also do ye:</verse>
  <verse number="14">and above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfectness.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to the which also ye were called in one body; and be ye thankful.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts unto God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And whatsoever ye do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Fathers, provoke not your children, that they be not discouraged.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Servants, obey in all things them that are your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord:</verse>
  <verse number="23">whatsoever ye do, work heartily, as unto the Lord, and not unto men;</verse>
  <verse number="24">knowing that from the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance: ye serve the Lord Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For he that doeth wrong shall receive again for the wrong that he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.</verse>
