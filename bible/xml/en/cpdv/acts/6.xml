  <verse number="1">In those days, as the number of disciples was increasing, there occurred a murmuring of the Greeks against the Hebrews, because their widows were treated with disdain in the daily ministration.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And so the twelve, calling together the multitude of the disciples, said: “It is not fair for us to leave behind the Word of God to serve at tables also.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Therefore, brothers, search among yourselves for seven men of good testimony, filled with the Holy Spirit and with wisdom, whom we may appoint over this work.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Yet truly, we will be continually in prayer and in the ministry of the Word.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the plan pleased the entire multitude. And they chose Stephen, a man filled with faith and with the Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolas, a new arrival from Antioch.</verse>
  <verse number="6">These they set before the sight of the Apostles, and while praying, they imposed hands on them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the Word of the Lord was increasing, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem was multiplied exceedingly. And even a large group of the priests were obedient to the faith.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then Stephen, filled with grace and fortitude, wrought great signs and miracles among the people.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But certain ones, from the synagogue of the so-called Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those who were from Cilicia and Asia rose up and were disputing with Stephen.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then they suborned men who were to claim that they had heard him speaking words of blasphemy against Moses and against God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And thus did they stir up the people and the elders and the scribes. And hurrying together, they seized him and brought him to the council.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And they set up false witnesses, who said: “This man does not cease to speak words against the holy place and the law.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For we have heard him saying that this Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place and will change the traditions, which Moses handed down to us.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">And all those who were sitting in the council, gazing at him, saw his face, as if it had become the face of an Angel.</verse>
