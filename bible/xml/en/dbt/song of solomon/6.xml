<chapter book="Song of Solomon" number="6" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Whither is thy beloved gone, Thou fairest among women? Whither is thy beloved turned aside? And we will seek him with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="2">My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, To feed in the gardens and to gather lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine: He feedeth [his flock] among the lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thou art fair, my love, as Tirzah, Comely as Jerusalem, Terrible as troops with banners:</verse>
  <verse number="5">Turn away thine eyes from me, For they overcome me. Thy hair is as a flock of goats On the slopes of Gilead.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep Which go up from the washing; Which have all borne twins, And none is barren among them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples Behind thy veil.</verse>
  <verse number="8">There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, And virgins without number:</verse>
  <verse number="9">My dove, mine undefiled, is but one; She is the only one of her mother, She is the choice one of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and they called her blessed; The queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Who is she that looketh forth as the dawn, Fair as the moon, clear as the sun, Terrible as troops with banners?</verse>
  <verse number="11">I went down into the garden of nuts, To see the verdure of the valley, To see whether the vine budded, Whether the pomegranates blossomed.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Before I was aware, My soul set me upon the chariots of my willing people.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Return, return, O Shulamite; Return, return, that we may look upon thee.—What would ye look upon in the Shulamite?—As it were the dance of two camps.</verse>
