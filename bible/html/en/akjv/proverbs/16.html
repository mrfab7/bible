<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="16" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weighs the spirits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Commit your works to the LORD, and your thoughts shall be established.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The LORD has made all things for himself: yes, even the wicked for the day of evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When a man’s ways please the LORD, he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A man’s heart devises his way: but the LORD directs his steps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresses not in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">A just weight and balance are the LORD’s: all the weights of the bag are his work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaks right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">In the light of the king’s countenance is life; and his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keeps his way preserves his soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Pride goes before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He that handles a matter wisely shall find good: and whoever trusts in the LORD, happy is he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increases learning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Understanding is a wellspring of life to him that has it: but the instruction of fools is folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The heart of the wise teaches his mouth, and adds learning to his lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">There is a way that seems right to a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He that labors labors for himself; for his mouth craves it of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">An ungodly man digs up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A fraudulent man sows strife: and a whisperer separates chief friends.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">A violent man entices his neighbor, and leads him into the way that is not good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He shuts his eyes to devise fraudulent things: moving his lips he brings evil to pass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that rules his spirit than he that takes a city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.</p>
