  <verse number="1">but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
  <verse number="2">At break of day however He returned to the Temple, and there the people came to Him in crowds. He seated Himself;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and was teaching them when the Scribes and the Pharisees brought to Him a woman who had been found committing adultery. They made her stand in the centre of the court, and they put the case to Him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">“Rabbi,” they said, “this woman has been found in the very act of committing adultery.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now, in the Law, Moses has ordered us to stone such women to death. But what do you say?”</verse>
  <verse number="6">They asked this in order to put Him to the test, so that they might have some charge to bring against Him. But Jesus leant forward and began to write with His finger on the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="7">When however they persisted with their question, He raised His head and said to them, “Let the sinless man among you be the first to throw a stone at her.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then He leant forward again, and again began to write on the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="9">They listened to Him, and then, beginning with the eldest, took their departure, one by one, till all were gone. And Jesus was left behind alone—and the woman in the centre of the court.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then, raising His head, Jesus said to her, “Where are they? Has no one condemned you?”</verse>
  <verse number="11">“No one, Sir,” she replied. “And *I* do not condemn you either,” said Jesus; “go, and from this time do not sin any more.”</verse>
  <verse number="12">Once more Jesus addressed them. “I am the Light of the world,” He said; “the man who follows me shall certainly not walk in the dark, but shall have the light of Life.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">“You are giving testimony about yourself,” said the Pharisees; “your testimony is not true.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">“Even if I am giving testimony about myself,” replied Jesus, “my testimony is true; for I know where I came from and where I am going, but you know neither of these two things.</verse>
  <verse number="15">You judge according to appearances: I am judging no one.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And even if I do judge, my judgement is just; for I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">In your own Law, too, it is written that the testimony of two men is true.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I am one giving testimony about myself, and the Father who sent me gives testimony about me.”</verse>
  <verse number="19">“Where is your Father?” they asked. “You know my Father as little as you know me.” He replied; “if you knew me, you would know my Father also.”</verse>
  <verse number="20">These sayings He uttered in the Treasury, while teaching in the Temple; yet no one arrested Him, because His time had not yet come.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Again He said to them, “I am going away. Then you will try to find me, but you will die in your sins. Where I am going, it is impossible for you to come.”</verse>
  <verse number="22">The Jews began to ask one another, “Is he going to kill himself, do you think, that he says, ‘Where I am going, it is impossible for you to come’?”</verse>
  <verse number="23">“You,” He continued, “are from below, I am from above: you are of this present world, I am not of this present world.</verse>
  <verse number="24">That is why I told you that you will die in your sins; for, unless you believe that I am He, that is what will happen.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">“You—who are you?” they asked. “How is it that I am speaking to you at all?” replied Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="26">“Many things I have to speak and to judge concerning you. But He who sent me is true, and the things which I have heard from Him are those which I have come into the world to speak.”</verse>
  <verse number="27">They did not perceive that He was speaking to them of the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="28">So Jesus added, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He. Of myself I do nothing; but as the Father has taught me, so I speak.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And He who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone: for I do always what is pleasing to Him.”</verse>
  <verse number="30">As He thus spoke, many became believers in Him.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Jesus therefore said to those of the Jews who had now believed in Him, “As for you, if you hold fast to my teaching, then you are truly my disciples;</verse>
  <verse number="32">and you shall know the Truth, and the Truth will make you free.”</verse>
  <verse number="33">“We are descendants of Abraham,” they answered, “and have never at any time been in slavery to any one. What do those words of yours mean, ‘You shall become free’?”</verse>
  <verse number="34">“In most solemn truth I tell you,” replied Jesus, “that every one who commits sin is the slave of sin.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Now a slave does not remain permanently in his master’s house, but a son does.</verse>
  <verse number="36">If then the Son shall make you free, you will be free indeed.</verse>
  <verse number="37">You are descendants of Abraham, I know; but you want to kill me, because my teaching gains no ground within you.</verse>
  <verse number="38">The words I speak are those I have learnt in the presence of the Father. Therefore you also should do what you have heard from your father.”</verse>
  <verse number="39">“Our father is Abraham,” they said. “If you were Abraham’s children,” replied Jesus, “it is Abraham’s deeds that you would be doing.</verse>
  <verse number="40">But, in fact, you are longing to kill me, a man who has spoken to you the truth which I have heard from God. Abraham did not do that.</verse>
  <verse number="41">You are doing the deeds of your father.” “We,” they replied, “are not illegitimate children. We have one Father, namely God.”</verse>
  <verse number="42">“If God were your Father,” said Jesus, “you would love me; for it is from God that I came and I am now here. I have not come of myself, but *He* sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="43">How is it you do not understand me when I speak? It is because you cannot bear to listen to my words.</verse>
  <verse number="44">The father whose sons you are is the Devil; and you desire to do what gives him pleasure. *He* was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand firm in the truth—for there is no truth in him. Whenever he utters his lie, he utters it out of his own store; for he is a liar, and the father of lies.</verse>
  <verse number="45">But because I speak the truth, you do not believe me.</verse>
  <verse number="46">Which of *you* convicts me of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe me?</verse>
  <verse number="47">He who is a child of God listens to God’s words. You do not listen to them: and why? It is because you are not God’s children.”</verse>
  <verse number="48">“Are we not right,” answered the Jews, “in saying that you are a Samaritan and are possessed by a demon?”</verse>
  <verse number="49">“I am not possessed by a demon,” replied Jesus. “On the contrary I honour my Father, and you dishonour me.</verse>
  <verse number="50">I, however, am not aiming at glory for myself: there is One who aims at glory for me—and who judges.</verse>
  <verse number="51">In most solemn truth I tell you that if any one shall have obeyed my teaching he shall in no case ever see death.”</verse>
  <verse number="52">“Now,” exclaimed the Jews, “we know that you are possessed by a demon. Abraham died, and so did the Prophets, and yet *you* say, ‘If any one shall have obeyed my teaching, he shall in no case ever taste death.’</verse>
  <verse number="53">Are you really greater than our forefather Abraham? For he died. And the prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?”</verse>
  <verse number="54">“Were I to glorify myself,” answered Jesus, “I should have no real glory. There is One who glorifies me—namely my Father, who you say is your God.</verse>
  <verse number="55">You do not know Him, but I know Him perfectly; and were I to deny my knowledge of Him, I should resemble you, and be a liar. On the contrary I do know Him, and I obey His commands.</verse>
  <verse number="56">Abraham your forefather exulted in the hope of seeing my day: and he saw it, and was glad.”</verse>
  <verse number="57">“You are not yet fifty years old,” cried the Jews, “and have you seen Abraham?”</verse>
  <verse number="58">“In most solemn truth,” answered Jesus, “I tell you that before Abraham came into existence, I am.”</verse>
  <verse number="59">Thereupon they took up stones with which to stone Him, but He hid Himself and went away out of the Temple.</verse>
