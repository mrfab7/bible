<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="3" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Brothers, I couldn’t speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren’t yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren’t you fleshly, and don’t you walk in the ways of men?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you fleshly?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For we are God’s fellow workers. You are God’s farming, God’s building.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">each man’s work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man’s work is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If any man’s work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If any man’s work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Don’t you know that you are a temple of God, and that God’s Spirit lives in you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, which you are.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, “He has taken the wise in their craftiness.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And again, “The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.</p>
