<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="12" translation="Webster Bible Translation" translationID="wbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away to these dumb idols, even as ye were led.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God who worketh all in all.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man for profit.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another, the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="9">To another, faith by the same Spirit; to another, the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="10">To another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, discerning of spirits; to another, divers kinds of languages; to another, the interpretation of languages:</verse>
  <verse number="11">But all these worketh that one and the same Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For the body is not one member, but many.</verse>
  <verse number="15">If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</verse>
  <verse number="16">And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</verse>
  <verse number="17">If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</verse>
  <verse number="18">But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And if they were all one member, where were the body?</verse>
  <verse number="20">But now are they many members, yet but one body.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:</verse>
  <verse number="23">And those members of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honor to that part which lacked:</verse>
  <verse number="25">That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And thus if one member suffers all the members suffer with it; or, if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, next miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of languages.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?</verse>
  <verse number="30">Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak in languages? do all interpret?</verse>
  <verse number="31">But covet earnestly the best gifts. And yet I show to you a more excellent way.</verse>
