  <verse number="1">And it will be in the thirtieth year, in the fourth, in the fifth to the month, and I in the midst of the captivity by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened and I shall see visions of God.</verse>
  <verse number="2">In the fifth to the month, this the fifth year to the captivity of king Jehoiachin,</verse>
  <verse number="3">The word of Jehovah being, was to Jehezhel, son of Buzi, the priest, in the land of the Chaldean by the river Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah will be there upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And I shall see, and behold, the spirit of a tempest came from the north, a great cloud, and a fire taking itself, and a shining to it round about, and from its midst as the appearance of burnished brass from the midst of the fire.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And from its midst the likeness of four living creatures: and this their vision; and the likeness of a man to them.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And four faces to one, and four wings to one, to them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And their feet a straight foot; and the sole of their feet as the sole of a calf’s foot; and sparkling as the appearance of polished brass.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And his hand of a man from under their wings upon their four sides; and their faces and their wings to these four.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And their wings joined every one to the other; they will not turn in their going, they will go each over against his face.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the likeness of their face, the face of a man and the face of a lion, to the right, to these four: and the face of an ox from the left to these four; and the face of an eagle to these four.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And their faces: and their wings spread out from above; to each of the two being joined each, and two covering their bodies.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they will go each over against his face; to where the spirit will be there to go, they will go; they will not turn in their going.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance as burning coals of fire, as the appearance of flames going about between the living creatures; and a shining to the fire, and from the fire will go forth lightning.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the living creatures ran and turned back as the appearance of lightning.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And I shall see the living creatures, and behold, one wheel upon the earth by the living creatures, to his four faces.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The appearance of the wheels and their works as the appearance of topaz: and one likeness to these four: and their appearance and their works as a wheel will be in the midst of the wheel.</verse>
  <verse number="17">In their going they will go upon their four sides: they will not turn in their going.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And their backs, and the height to them, and terror to them; and their backs full of eyes round about to them four.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And in the going of the living creatures, the wheels will go by them: and in the lifting up of the living creatures from the earth the wheels will be lifted up.</verse>
  <verse number="20">To where the spirit will be there to go they will go, there the spirit to go; and the wheels will be lifted up with them: for the spirit of life in the wheels.</verse>
  <verse number="21">In their going, they will go: and in their standing, they will stand; and in their being lifted up from the earth the wheels will be lifted up with them: for the spirit of life in the wheels.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the likeness upon the heads of the living creatures a firmament as the eye of the terrible crystal, stretched forth upon their heads from above.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And under the expansion their wings straight each to the other: to each, two, covering upon them, to each two covering to them their bodies.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And I shall hear the voice of their wings, as the voice of many waters, as the voice of the Almighty in their going, the voice of speech, as the voice of a camp: in their standing, their wings will slacken.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And a voice will be from above to the expansion which was over their head; in their standing their wings will slacken.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And from above to the expansion which was over their head as the appearance of a sapphire stone: the likeness of a throne, and over the likeness of a throne, the likeness as the appearance of a man upon it from above.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And I shall see as the appearance of burnished brass, as the appearance of fire within to it round about, from the appearance of his loins and above, and from the appearance of his loins to below, I saw as the appearance of fire, and a shining to it round about.</verse>
  <verse number="28">As the appearance of the bow which will be in the cloud in the day of rain, so the appearance of the shining round about This the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah. And I shall see it and I shall fall upon my face, and I shall hear the voice of him speaking.</verse>
