<div class="chapter" data-book="Ecclesiastes" data-chapter="6" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">There is another evil I have seen under the sun, and it weighs heavily upon mankind:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">God gives a man riches, wealth, and honor, so that he lacks nothing his heart desires; but God does not allow him to enjoy them. Instead, a stranger will enjoy them. This is futile and a grievous affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A man may father a hundred children and live for many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he is unsatisfied with his prosperity and does not even receive a proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For a stillborn child enters in futility and departs in darkness, and his name is shrouded in obscurity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The child, though neither seeing the sun nor knowing anything, has more rest than that man,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All a man’s labor is for his mouth, yet his appetite is never satisfied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">What advantage, then, has the wise man over the fool? What gain comes to the poor man who knows how to conduct himself before others?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Better what the eye can see than the wandering of desire. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Whatever exists was named long ago, and it is known what man is; but he cannot contend with one stronger than he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the more words, the more futility—and how does that profit anyone?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For who knows what is good for a man during the few days in which he passes through his fleeting life like a shadow? Who can tell a man what will come after him under the sun?</p>
