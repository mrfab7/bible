<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, servant of God, and sent of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the chosen of God, and the acknowledgment of the truth according to devotion;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">In hope of eternal life, (which God, not false, promised before eternal times;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And manifested his word in his own times, in the proclamation, which I was entrusted with according to the command of the Saviour our God;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To Titus, genuine child according to the common faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For this I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldest rectify things left behind, and set elders in the city, as I directed thee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If any be irreproachable, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not in accusation of licentiousness, or disorderly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For a bishop must be irreproachable, as steward of God; not self-sufficient, not prone to anger, not intemperate, not a striker, not occupied in sordid gain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But hospitable, a lover of good, of sound mind, just, holy, holding firm;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Holding firmly the faithful word according to instruction, that he may be able also to beseech in sound doctrine, and to refute those opposing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For many also are disorderly, vain talkers and infatuates, especially they of the circumcision:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Who must be restrained, who subvert whole houses, teaching what they ought not, for the sake of sordid gain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A certain of them said, their own prophet, The Cretians always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">This testimony is true. For this cause reprove them severely, that they may be sound in the faith;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Not holding to Jewish fictions, and commands of men, having turned away from the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All things truly pure to the pure: and to the defiled and unbelieving nothing pure; but also their mind and consciousness are defiled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">They confess to know God; and in works they deny, being abominable, and disobedient, and to every good work not tried.</p>
