<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Come near, ye nations, to hear, And attend, ye peoples; Let the earth hear, and the fulness thereof, The world, and all things that come forth of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For the LORD hath indignation against all the nations, And fury against all their host; He hath utterly destroyed them, He hath delivered them to the slaughter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Their slain also shall be cast out, And the stench of their carcasses shall come up, And the mountains shall be melted with their blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And all the host of heaven shall moulder away, And the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll; And all their host shall fall down, As the leaf falleth off from the vine, And as a falling fig from the fig-tree.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For My sword hath drunk its fill in heaven; Behold, it shall come down upon Edom, And upon the people of My ban, to judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, It is made fat with fatness, With the blood of lambs and goats, With the fat of the kidneys of rams; For the LORD hath a sacrifice in Bozrah, And a great slaughter in the land of Edom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the wild-oxen shall come down with them, And the bullocks with the bulls; And their land shall be drunken with blood, And their dust made fat with fatness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For the LORD hath a day of vengeance, A year of recompense for the controversy of Zion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, And the dust thereof into brimstone, And the land thereof shall become burning pitch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">It shall not be quenched night nor day, The smoke thereof shall go up for ever; From generation to generation it shall lie waste: None shall pass through it for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But the pelican and the bittern shall possess it, And the owl and the raven shall dwell therein; And He shall stretch over it The line of confusion, and the plummet of emptiness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">As for her nobles, none shall be there to be called to the kingdom; And all her princes shall be nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And thorns shall come up in her palaces, Nettles and thistles in the fortresses thereof; And it shall be a habitation of wild-dogs, An enclosure for ostriches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And the wild-cats shall meet with the jackals, And the satyr shall cry to his fellow; Yea, the night-monster shall repose there, And shall find her a place of rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">There shall the arrowsnake make her nest, and lay, And hatch, and brood under her shadow; Yea, there shall the kites be gathered, Every one with her mate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read; No one of these shall be missing, None shall want her mate; For My mouth it hath commanded, And the breath thereof it hath gathered them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And He hath cast the lot for them, And His hand hath divided it unto them by line; They shall possess it for ever, From generation to generation shall they dwell therein.</p>
