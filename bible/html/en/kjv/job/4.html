<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">[If] we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">[Is] not [this] thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Remember, I pray thee, who [ever] perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lionâ€™s whelps are scattered abroad.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image [was] before mine eyes, [there was] silence, and I heard a voice, [saying],</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">How much less [in] them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation [is] in the dust, [which] are crushed before the moth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding [it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Doth not their excellency [which is] in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.</p>
