<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan [by] Jericho.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they [were] many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all [that are] round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor [was] king of the Moabites at that time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which [is] by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they [are] too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, [that] we may smite them, and [that] I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest [is] blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men [are] these with thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, [saying],</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Behold, [there is] a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they [are] blessed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, [and] go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants [were] with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall [being] on this side, and a wall on that side.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where [was] no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And the ass said unto Balaam, [Am] not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since [I was] thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because [thy] way is perverse before me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which [is] in the border of Arnon, which [is] in the utmost coast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that [were] with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost [part] of the people.</p>
