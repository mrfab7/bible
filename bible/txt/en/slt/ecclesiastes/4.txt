1	And I turned back, and I shall see all the oppressions which are doing under the sun: and behold, the tears of the oppressed, and none comforting to them; and from the hand of those oppressing them was power, and none comforting to them.
2	And I praise the dead already dead more than the living they yet living.
3	And good above them two which were not yet, which saw not the evil work which was done under the sun.
4	And I saw all the labor and all the success of the work, for this the jealousy of a man from his neighbor. Also this is vanity and striving of spirit.
5	The foolish one folded his hands together, and ate his flesh.
6	Good a hand filled with rest, above two hands full of labor and striving of spirit.
7	And I turned back, and I shall see vanity under the sun.
8	There is one, and not a second; also a son and brother not to him: and no end to all his labor; also his eye shall not be satisfied with riches: and for whom do I labor and diminish my soul from good? Also this is vanity, and it is an evil labor.
9	Two are good above one, because there is to them a good reward in their labor.
10	For if they shall fall, the one will raise up his companion: and wo to him, the one that shall fall, and not a second to raise him up.
11	Also if two shall lie down, and heat to them: and to the one it shall not be warm.
12	And if one shall become strong against him, two shall stand before him; and a three-fold thread shall not be quickly broken.
13	Good a poor and wise child above an old and foolish king, who knew not more to receive instruction.
14	For from the house of those turning away he came forth to reign; for also he being born in his kingdom became poor.
15	I saw all the living going under the sun, with the second child which shall stand in his stead.
16	No end to all the people, to all which were before them: also the last ones shall not rejoice in him. For also this is vanity and striving of the spirit.
