<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me? men in whom ripe age is perished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They are gaunt with want and famine; they gnaw the dry ground; in the gloom of wasteness and desolation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They pluck salt-wort by the bushes; and the roots of the broom are their meat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">They are driven forth from the midst of men; they cry after them as after a thief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In the clefts of the valleys must they dwell, in holes of the earth and of the rocks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Among the bushes they bray; under the nettles they are gathered together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They are children of fools, yea, children of base men; they were scourged out of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And now I am become their song, yea, I am a byword unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, and spare not to spit in my face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For he hath loosed his cord, and afflicted me, and they have cast off the bridle before me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Upon my right hand rise the rabble; they thrust aside my feet, and they cast up against me their ways of destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, even men that have no helper.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">As through a wide breach they come: in the midst of the ruin they roll themselves upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Terrors are turned upon me, they chase mine honour as the wind; and my welfare is passed away as a cloud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And now my soul is poured out within me; days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">In the night season my bones are pierced in me, and the pains that gnaw me take no rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">By the great force of my disease is my garment disfigured: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I cry unto thee, and thou dost not answer me: I stand up, and thou lookest at me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Thou art turned to be cruel to me: with the might of thy hand thou persecutest me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Thou liftest me up to the wind, thou causest me to ride upon it; and thou dissolvest me in the storm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Surely against a ruinous heap he will not put forth his hand; though it be in his destruction, one may utter a cry because of these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the needy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">When I looked for good, then evil came; and when I waited for light, there came darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">My bowels boil, and rest not; days of affliction are come upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">I go mourning without the sun: I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">I am a brother to jackals, and a companion to ostriches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">My skin is black, and falleth from me, and my bones are burned with heat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Therefore is my harp turned to mourning, and my pipe into the voice of them that weep.</p>
