<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the salvation in that day will be turned to mourning to all the people: for the people heard in that day, saying the king was grieved for his son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the people will steal away in that day to go to the city, as people will steal away being ashamed in fleeing in battle.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="6">To love those hating thee, and hating those loving thee, for thou announcedst this day that not to the chiefs and servants: for I knew this day that if Absalom lived and all we this day died, that then it was straight in thine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And now arise, go forth, and speak to the heart of thy servants: for in Jehovah I swore if thou wilt not go forth, if a man shall lodge with thee this night: and this evil to thee above all the evil which came upon thee from thy youth till now.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And king David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak ye to the old men of Judah, saying, Wherefore will ye be the last to turn back the king to his house? And the word of all Israel came to the king to his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Ye my brethren; my bone and flesh are ye: and wherefore will ye be last to turn back the king?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And to Amasa ye shall say, Art thou not my bone and my flesh? thus will God do to me and thus will he add, if thou shalt not be chief of the army before me all the days, instead of Joab.</p>
