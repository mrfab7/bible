<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now the LORD had said to Abram, Depart from thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, to a land that I will show thee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken to him, and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed from Haran.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went to go forth into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To thy seed will I give this land: and there he erected an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he removed from thence to a mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he erected an altar to the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Abram journeyed, going on still towards the south.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to dwell there; for the famine was grievous in the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And it came to pass, when he had come near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Therefore it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And it came to pass, that when Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he treated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues, because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done to me? why didst thou not tell me that she is thy wife?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me for a wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.</p>
