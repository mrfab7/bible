  <verse number="1">The Elder to the elect lady and her children. Truly I love you all, and not I alone, but also all who know the truth,</verse>
  <verse number="2">for the sake of the truth which is continually in our hearts and will be with us for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Grace, mercy and peace will be with us from God the Father, and from Jesus Christ the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</verse>
  <verse number="4">It is an intense joy to me to have found some of your children living true Christian lives, in obedience to the command which we have received from the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And now, dear lady, I pray you—writing to you, as I do, not a new command, but the one which we have had from the very beginning—let us love one another.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The love of which I am speaking consists in our living in obedience to God’s commands. God’s command is that you should live in obedience to what you all heard from the very beginning.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For many deceivers have gone out into the world—men who do not acknowledge Jesus as Christ who has come in human nature. Such a one is ‘the deceiver’ and ‘the anti-Christ.’</verse>
  <verse number="8">Keep guard over yourselves, so that you may not lose the results of your good deeds, but may receive back a full reward.</verse>
  <verse number="9">No one has God, who instead of remaining true to the teaching of Christ, presses on in advance: but he who remains true to that teaching has both the Father and the Son.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If any one who comes to you does not bring this teaching, do not receive him under your roof nor bid him Farewell.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He who bids him Farewell is a sharer in his evil deeds.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I have a great deal to say to you all, but will not write it with paper and ink. Yet I hope to come to see you and speak face to face, so that your happiness may be complete.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The children of your elect sister send greetings to you.</verse>
