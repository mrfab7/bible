<chapter book="Job" number="32" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But these three men ceased to answer Job, because he considered himself justified.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram, was angry and indignant. But he was angry against Job because he described himself to be just in the presence of God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Moreover, he was indignant with his friends because they had not found a reasonable response, except in so far as they condemned Job.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Therefore, Eliu waited while Job was talking, for these were his elders that were speaking.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But when he saw that these three were not able to respond, he was extremely angry.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And so Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite responded by saying: I am younger in years, and you are more ancient; therefore, I kept my head low, for I was afraid to reveal to you my opinion.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For I had hoped that greater age would speak, and that a multitude of years would teach wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But I see now that there is only breath in men, and that it is the inspiration of the Almighty that gives understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The wise are not the aged, nor do the elders understand judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore, I will speak. Listen to me, and so I will show you my wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For I have endured your words; I have paid attention to your deliberations, while you were being argumentative with words.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And as long as I supposed that you were saying something, I considered; but now I see that there is none of you that is able to argue with Job and to respond to his words.</verse>
  <verse number="13">So that you will not say, “We have found wisdom,” God has thrown him down, not man.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He has said nothing to me, and I will not respond to him according to your words.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then they were filled with dread, and so they no longer responded, and they withdrew from their speechmaking.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore, because I have waited and they have not been speaking, for they stood firm and did not respond at all,</verse>
  <verse number="17">I also will answer in my turn, and I will reveal my knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For I am full of words, and the feeling in my gut inspires me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Yes, my stomach is like fermenting wine without a vent, which bursts the new containers.</verse>
  <verse number="20">I should speak, but I will also breathe a little; I will open my lips, and I will answer.</verse>
  <verse number="21">I will not esteem the reputation of a man, and I will not equate God with man.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For I do not know how long I will continue, and whether, after a while, my Maker might take me away.</verse>
