<chapter book="Hebrews" number="6" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And this will we do, if God permit.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</verse>
  <verse number="5">And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</verse>
  <verse number="6">If they shall fall away, to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For the earth which drinks in the rain that comes oft on it, and brings forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receives blessing from God:</verse>
  <verse number="8">But that which bears thorns and briers is rejected, and is near to cursing; whose end is to be burned.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love, which you have showed toward his name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope to the end:</verse>
  <verse number="12">That you be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,</verse>
  <verse number="14">Saying, Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For men truly swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Wherein God, willing more abundantly to show to the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath:</verse>
  <verse number="18">That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us:</verse>
  <verse number="19">Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters into that within the veil;</verse>
  <verse number="20">Where the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
