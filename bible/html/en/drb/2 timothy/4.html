<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I charge thee, before God and Jesus Christ, who shall judge the living and the dead, by his coming, and his kingdom:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Preach the word: be instant in season, out of season: reprove, entreat, rebuke in all patience and doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For there shall be a time, when they will not endure sound doctrine; but, according to their own desires, they will heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And will indeed turn away their hearing from the truth, but will be turned unto fables.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But be thou vigilant, labour in all things, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry. Be sober.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For I am even now ready to be sacrificed: and the time of my dissolution is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice, which the Lord the just judge will render to me in that day: and not only to me, but to them also that love his coming. Make haste to come to me quickly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For Demas hath left me, loving this world, and is gone to Thessalonica:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Crescens into Galatia, Titus into Dalmatia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The cloak that I left at Troas, with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, especially the parchments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Alexander the coppersmith hath done me much evil: the Lord will reward him according to his works:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Whom do thou also avoid, for he hath greatly withstood our words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">At my first answer no man stood with me, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their charge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that by me the preaching may be accomplished, and that all the Gentiles may hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The Lord hath delivered me from every evil work: and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Erastus remained at Corinth. And Trophimus I left sick at Miletus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Make haste to come before winter Eubulus and Pudens, and Linus and Claudia, and all the brethren, salute thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>
