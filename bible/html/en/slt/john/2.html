<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the third day was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Jesus was also called, and his disciples, to the wedding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And wine having failed, the mother of Jesus says to him, They have no wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Jesus says to her, What to me and thee, woman mine hour comes not yet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">His mother says to the servants, Whatever he says to you, do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And six stone water buckets were placed there, according to the purification of the Jews, containing each two or three measures.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Jesus says to them, Fill the water buckets with water. And they filled them even up over.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he says to them, Draw now, and carry to the superintendent of the feast. And they carried.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And when the superintendent of the feast tasted the wine having been water, and knew not whence it is: (and the servants knew, having drawn the water;) the superintendent calls the bridegroom,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And says to him, Every man sets good wine first; and when they be intoxicated, then inferior: thou hast kept the good wine till now.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they remained there not many days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the pascha of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And found in the temple those selling oxen and sheep and doves, and money-changers sitting;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And having made a scourge of ropes, he cast all out of the temple, also sheep, and oxen; and poured out the small coin of money-changers, and overturned the tables;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he said to those selling doves, Take away these things hence; make not the house of my Father a house of merchandise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And his disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thine house has eaten me up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then answered the Jews and said to him, What sign shewest thou, that thou doest these things?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Jesus answered and said to them, Loose this temple, and in three days will I raise it up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Then said the Jews, In forty-six years was this temple built, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But he spake concerning the temple of his body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this to them; and they believed the writing, and the word which Jesus spake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And when he was in Jerusalem at the pascha, in the festival, many believed in his name, beholding his signs which he did.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Jesus himself trusted not himself to them, for he knew all,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For also he had no need that any should testify concerning man: for he knew what was in man.</p>
