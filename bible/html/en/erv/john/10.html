<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">When he hath put forth all his own, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Jesus therefore said unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">All that came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and go out, and shall find pasture.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The thief cometh not, but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd layeth down his life for the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He that is a hireling, and not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, beholdeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, and the wolf snatcheth them, and scattereth them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">he fleeth because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I am the good shepherd; and I know mine own, and mine own know me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">even as the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and they shall become one flock, one shepherd.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Therefore doth the Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">No one taketh it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment received I from my Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">There arose a division again among the Jews because of these words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Others said, These are not the sayings of one possessed with a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem: it was winter;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">and Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon’s porch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The Jews therefore came round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou hold us in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believe not: the works that I do in my Father’s name, these bear witness of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">My Father, which hath given them unto me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">I and the Father are one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The Jews took up stones again to stone him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from the Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">say ye of him, whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">But if I do them, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">They sought again to take him: and he went forth out of their hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And he went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John was at the first baptizing; and there he abode.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And many came unto him; and they said, John indeed did no sign: but all things whatsoever John spake of this man were true.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And many believed on him there.</p>
