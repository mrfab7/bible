  <verse number="1">Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,</verse>
  <verse number="5">That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Though his excellence shall mount up to the heavens, and his head reach to the clouds;</verse>
  <verse number="7">Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they who have seen him shall say, Where is he?</verse>
  <verse number="8">He shall fly away as a dream, and will not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.</verse>
  <verse number="11">His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Though wickedness may be sweet in his mouth, though he may hide it under his tongue;</verse>
  <verse number="13">Though he may spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:</verse>
  <verse number="14">Yet his food in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.</verse>
  <verse number="16">He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper’s tongue shall slay him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He shall not see the river, the floods, the brooks of honey and buttermilk.</verse>
  <verse number="18">That which he labored for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice in it.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away a house which he did not build.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.</verse>
  <verse number="21">There shall none of his food be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.</verse>
  <verse number="22">In the fullness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.</verse>
  <verse number="25">It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yes, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="26">All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="27">The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.</verse>
  <verse number="29">This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed to him by God.</verse>
