<p class="verse" data-verse="1">This is the word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch son of Neriah when he wrote these words on a scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">You have said, ‘Woe is me because the LORD has added sorrow to my pain! I am worn out with groaning and have found no rest.’”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thus Jeremiah was to say to Baruch: “This is what the LORD says: Throughout the land I will demolish what I have built and uproot what I have planted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But as for you, do you seek great things for yourself? Stop seeking! For I will bring disaster on every living creature, declares the LORD, but wherever you go, I will grant your life as a spoil of war.”</p>
