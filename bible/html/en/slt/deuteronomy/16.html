<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Watch the month of Abib, and do the passover to Jehovah thy God: for in the month of Abib Jehovah thy God brought thee out of Egypt by night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And sacrifice the passover to Jehovah thy God, of the sheep, and the oxen in the place which Jehovah shall choose to cause his name to dwell there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thou shalt not eat upon it leavened; seven days thou shalt eat upon it unleavened, the bread of affliction; (for in hasty flight thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt) so that thou shalt remember the day of thy coming forth from the land of Egypt all the days of thy life,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And leaven shall not be seen to thee in all thy boundary seven days; and there shall not remain over night from the flesh which thou shalt sacrifice in the evening, in the first day to the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thou shalt not be able to sacrifice the passover in one of thy gates which Jehovah thy God gave to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But at the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there, thou shalt sacrifice the passover in the evening, as the sun went down, the appointment of thy coming out of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And boil thou and eat in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose in it: and turn in the morning and go to thy tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Six days shalt thou eat unleavened, and in the seventh day an enclosing to Jehovah thy God: thou shalt not do work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Seven weeks shalt thou number to thee: from the beginning of the sickle upon the standing grain, thou shalt begin to number seven weeks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And do thou the festival of weeks to Jehovah thy God according to the willingness of thy hand which thou shalt give as Jehovah thy God shall bless thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And rejoice before Jehovah thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy servant, and thy maid, and the Levite that is in thy gates, and the stranger, and the orphan and the widow, which are in the midst of thee in the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And remember that thou wert a servant in Egypt: and watch thou and do these laws.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The festival of booths thou shalt do to thee seven days, in thy gathering of thy threshing floor and of thy wine press.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And rejoice in thy festival, thou and thy son and thy daughter, and thy servant, and thy maid, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow, which are in thy gates:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Seven days shalt thou keep a festival to Jehovah thy God in the place which Jehovah shall choose; for Jehovah thy God shall bless thee in all thy produce and in all the work of thy hands, and thou shalt surely be joyful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Three times in a year shall every one of thy males be seen before Jehovah thy God in the place which he shall choose in the festival of unleavened, and in the festival of weeks, and in the festival of booths: and he shall not be seen before Jehovah empty:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Each according to the gift of his hand, according to the blessing of Jehovah thy God which he gave to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Judges and scribes shall thou give to thee in all thy gates which Jehovah thy God gave to thee according to thy tribes: and they judged the people just judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thou shalt not turn away Judgment; thou shalt not look upon and thou shalt not take a gift, for the gift will blind the eyes of the wise and will pervert the words of the just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Justice, justice shalt thou follow, so that thou live and inherit the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Thou shalt not plant to thee a grove of any wood near the altar of Jehovah thy God which thou shalt make to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And thou shalt not set up to thee a pillar, which Jehovah thy God hates.</p>
