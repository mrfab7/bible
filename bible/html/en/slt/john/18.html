<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Jesus having said these, went out with his disciples beyond the torrent Kedron, where was a garden, into which he came, he and his disciples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Judas also knew the place, he delivering him up: for Jesus was many times gathered there with his disciples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then Judas, having taken a band and attendants from the chief priests and Pharisees, comes there with lights and torches and weapons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Jesus then, knowing all coming upon him, having come out, said to them, Whom seek ye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">They answered him, Jesus the Nazarite. Jesus says to them, I am. And Judas also, he delivering up, was standing with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then, when he said to them, That I am, they went away backward, and fell to the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Then asked he them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus the Nazarite.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Jesus answered, I said to you, that I am: if then ye seek me, leave these to retire:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">That the word might be completed which he spake, That whom thou hast given me, I lost none of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and struck the chief priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. And the name to the servant was Malchus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Then said Jesus to Peter, Put thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Then the band and captain of a thousand and attendants of the Jews took Jesus, and bound him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And led him away to Annas first; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the chief priest that year.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Caiaphas was he having counselled the Jews, that it is profitable for one man to be destroyed for the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and another disciple: and that disciple was known to the chief priest, and came together with Jesus to the hall of the chief priest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Peter stood before the door without. Then went out the other disciple who was known to the chief priest, and spake to her guarding the door, and brought in Peter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Then says the young girl guarding the door to Peter, Art not thou also of this man’s disciples? He says, I am not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the servants and attendants stood, having made a heap of burning coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and Peter was standing with them, and warming himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Then the chief priest asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his teaching.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Jesus answered him, I spake with freedom of speech to the world: I always taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews were always come together; and I spake nothing in secret.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Why askest thou me? ask those having heard, what I said to them: see, they know what I said.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And he having said these things, one of the attendants standing by gave Jesus a blow with a rod, having said, Answerest thou the chief priest so?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Jesus answered him, If I spake badly, testify of evil: and if well, why strikest thou me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">(Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the chief priest.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Simon Peter was standing, and warming himself. Then said they to him, Art thou not also of his disciples he denied, and said, I am not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Says one of the chief priest’s servants, being of his family whose ear Peter cut off, Saw I not thee in the garden with him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Then Peter again denied: and quickly the cock uttered a sound.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the pretorium: and it was early morning; and they came not into the pretorium, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the pascha.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Then went Pilate out to them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">They answered and said to him, If he were not injurious, we had not delivered him to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Then said Pilate to them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. Then said the Jews to him, It is not lawful for us to kill any one:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">That the word of Jesus might be completed which he spake, giving a sign by what death he was about to die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Then came Pilate again into the pretorium, and asked Jesus, and said to him, Art thou the King of the Jews?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Jesus answered him, of thyself sayest thou this, or did others tell thee of me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Pilate answered, Much less am I a Jew; thy nation and the chief priests have delivered thee to me: What didst thou?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, my servants had contended, that I be not delivered to the Jews; and now my kingdom is not hence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Then said Pilate to him, Art thou not then king? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am king. For this was I born, and for this came I into the world, that I testify to the truth. Every one being of the truth hears my voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">Pilate says to him, What is truth? And having said this, again went he out to the Jews, and says to them, I find no fault in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">But a custom is to you, that I loose one to you in the pascha: will ye therefore I should loose to you the King of the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Then cried they all again, saying, Not this, but Barabbas: and Barabbas was a robber.</p>
