<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And it was in the last of the days the mountain of the house of Jehovah will be prepared upon the head of the mountains, and it was lifted up above the hills, and peoples flowed to it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And many nations went and said, Come, and we will go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us from his ways, and we will go in his paths: from Zion will instruction go forth, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he judged between many peoples, and he admonished to strong nations even to far off; and they beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning-knives: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, and they shall no more learn war.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree, and none terrifying: for the mouth of Jehovah of armies spake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For all peoples shall go each in the name of his God, and will go in the name of Jehovah our God for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In that day, says Jehovah, I will assemble her halting, and I will gather her thrust out, and whom I broke in pieces.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I set her halting for a remnant, and her far removed, for a strong nation: and Jehovah reigning over them in mount Zion from now and even to forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And thou, O tower of the flock, hill of the daughter of Zion, even to thee shall it come, and the first dominion: came the kingdom to the daughter of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Now wherefore wilt thou cry out with an outcry? is no king in thee? or thy counselor perished? for pain laid hold of thee as she bringing forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Be in pain and bring forth, O daughter of Zion, as she bringing forth: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and dwell in the field, and going even to Babel; there shalt thou be delivered; there Jehovah will redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And now many nations were gathered against thee, saying, She shall be defiled, and our eyes shall look upon Zion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And they knew not the purposes of Jehovah, and they understood not his counsel for he gathered them as sheaves of the threshing-floor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will set thy horn iron, and thy hoofs of brass: and thou didst crush many peoples: and I devoted their plunder to Jehovah, and their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.</p>
