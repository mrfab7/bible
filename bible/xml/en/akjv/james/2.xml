  <verse number="1">My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For if there come to your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</verse>
  <verse number="3">And you have respect to him that wears the gay clothing, and say to him, Sit you here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand you there, or sit here under my footstool:</verse>
  <verse number="4">Are you not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Listen, my beloved brothers, Has not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them that love him?</verse>
  <verse number="6">But you have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which you are called?</verse>
  <verse number="8">If you fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, You shall love your neighbor as yourself, you do well:</verse>
  <verse number="9">But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if you commit no adultery, yet if you kill, you are become a transgressor of the law.</verse>
  <verse number="12">So speak you, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For he shall have judgment without mercy, that has showed no mercy; and mercy rejoices against judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="14">What does it profit, my brothers, though a man say he has faith, and have not works? can faith save him?</verse>
  <verse number="15">If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</verse>
  <verse number="16">And one of you say to them, Depart in peace, be you warmed and filled; notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body; what does it profit?</verse>
  <verse number="17">Even so faith, if it has not works, is dead, being alone.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Yes, a man may say, You have faith, and I have works: show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.</verse>
  <verse number="19">You believe that there is one God; you do well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But will you know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son on the altar?</verse>
  <verse number="22">See you how faith worked with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</verse>
  <verse number="23">And the scripture was fulfilled which said, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</verse>
  <verse number="24">You see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</verse>
  <verse number="26">For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</verse>
