<chapter book="Job" number="21" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But Job answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.</verse>
  <verse number="4">As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand on your mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling takes hold on my flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Why do the wicked live, become old, yes, are mighty in power?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God on them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Their bull engenders, and fails not; their cow calves, and casts not her calf.</verse>
  <verse number="11">They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.</verse>
  <verse number="12">They take the tambourine and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Therefore they say to God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of your ways.</verse>
  <verse number="15">What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray to him?</verse>
  <verse number="16">See, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft comes their destruction on them! God distributes sorrows in his anger.</verse>
  <verse number="18">They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carries away.</verse>
  <verse number="19">God lays up his iniquity for his children: he rewards him, and he shall know it.</verse>
  <verse number="20">His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For what pleasure has he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the middle?</verse>
  <verse number="22">Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judges those that are high.</verse>
  <verse number="23">One dies in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.</verse>
  <verse number="24">His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And another dies in the bitterness of his soul, and never eats with pleasure.</verse>
  <verse number="26">They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which you wrongfully imagine against me.</verse>
  <verse number="28">For you say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?</verse>
  <verse number="29">Have you not asked them that go by the way? and do you not know their tokens,</verse>
  <verse number="30">That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he has done?</verse>
  <verse number="32">Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.</verse>
  <verse number="33">The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.</verse>
  <verse number="34">How then comfort you me in vain, seeing in your answers there remains falsehood?</verse>
