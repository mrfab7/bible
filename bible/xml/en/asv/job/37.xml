  <verse number="1">Yea, at this my heart trembleth, And is moved out of its place.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice, And the sound that goeth out of his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven, And his lightning unto the ends of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">After it a voice roareth; He thundereth with the voice of his majesty; And he restraineth not the lightnings when his voice is heard</verse>
  <verse number="5">God thundereth marvellously with his voice; Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For he saith to the snow, Fall thou on the earth; Likewise to the shower of rain, And to the showers of his mighty rain.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He sealeth up the hand of every man, That all men whom he hath made may know it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then the beasts go into coverts, And remain in their dens.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Out of the chamber of the south cometh the storm, And cold out of the north.</verse>
  <verse number="10">By the breath of God ice is given; And the breadth of the waters is straitened.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture; He spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning:</verse>
  <verse number="12">And it is turned round about by his guidance, That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them Upon the face of the habitable world,</verse>
  <verse number="13">Whether it be for correction, or for his land, Or for lovingkindness, that he cause it to come.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Hearken unto this, O Job: Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Dost thou know how God layeth his charge upon them, And causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine?</verse>
  <verse number="16">Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, The wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?</verse>
  <verse number="17">How thy garments are warm, When the earth is still by reason of the south wind?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Canst thou with him spread out the sky, Which is strong as a molten mirror?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Teach us what we shall say unto him; For we cannot set our speech in order by reason of darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Shall it be told him that I would speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?</verse>
  <verse number="21">And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies; But the wind passeth, and cleareth them.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Out of the north cometh golden splendor: God hath upon him terrible majesty.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: He is excellent in power; And in justice and plenteous righteousness he will not afflict.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Men do therefore fear him: He regardeth not any that are wise of heart.</verse>
