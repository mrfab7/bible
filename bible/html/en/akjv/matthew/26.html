<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">You know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, to the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">When Jesus understood it, he said to them, Why trouble you the woman? for she has worked a good work on me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For you have the poor always with you; but me you have not always.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For in that she has poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman has done, be told for a memorial of her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And said to them, What will you give me, and I will deliver him to you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, Where will you that we prepare for you to eat the passover?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Master said, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at your house with my disciples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And as they did eat, he said, Truly I say to you, that one of you shall betray me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say to him, Lord, is it I?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he answered and said, He that dips his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The Son of man goes as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said to him, You have said.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink you all of it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">But I say to you, I will not drink from now on of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Then said Jesus to them, All you shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Peter answered and said to him, Though all men shall be offended because of you, yet will I never be offended.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, That this night, before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Peter said to him, Though I should die with you, yet will I not deny you. Likewise also said all the disciples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Then comes Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, Sit you here, while I go and pray yonder.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">Then said he to them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even to death: tarry you here, and watch with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as you will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And he comes to the disciples, and finds them asleep, and said to Peter, What, could you not watch with me one hour?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, your will be done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Then comes he to his disciples, and said to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that does betray me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">And while he yet spoke, see, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">And immediately he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">And Jesus said to him, Friend, why are you come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s, and smote off his ear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">Then said Jesus to him, Put up again your sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">Think you that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are you come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and you laid no hold on me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="57">And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="58">But Peter followed him afar off to the high priest’s palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="59">Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="60">But found none: yes, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="61">And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="62">And the high priest arose, and said to him, Answer you nothing? what is it which these witness against you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="63">But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you be the Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="64">Jesus said to him, You have said: nevertheless I say to you, Hereafter shall you see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="65">Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="66">What think you? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="67">Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="68">Saying, Prophesy to us, you Christ, Who is he that smote you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="69">Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came to him, saying, You also were with Jesus of Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="70">But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what you say.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="71">And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said to them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="72">And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="73">And after a while came to him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely you also are one of them; for your speech denudes you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="74">Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="75">And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said to him, Before the cock crow, you shall deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.</p>
