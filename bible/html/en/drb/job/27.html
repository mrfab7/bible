<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Job also added, taking up his parable, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment, and the Almighty, who hath brought my soul to bitterness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">As long as breath remaineth in me, and the spirit of God in my nostrils,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">My lips shall not speak iniquity, neither shall my tongue contrive lying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">God forbid that I should judge you to be just: till I die I will not depart from my innocence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">My justification, which I have begun to hold, I will not forsake: for my heart doth not reprehend me in all my life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Let my enemy be as the ungodly, and my adversary as the wicked one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For what is the hope of the hypocrite if through covetousness he take by violence, and God deliver not his soul?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Will God hear his cry, when distress shall come upon him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Or can he delight himself in the Almighty, and call upon God at all times?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I will teach you by the hand of God, what the Almighty hath, and I will not conceal it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Behold you all know it, and why do you speak vain things without cause?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the inheritance of the violent, which they shall receive of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If his sons be multiplied, they shall be for the sword, and his grandsons shall not be filled with bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">They that shall remain of him, shall be buried in death, and his widows shall not weep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If he shall heap together silver as earth, and prepare raiment as clay,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He shall prepare indeed, but the just man shall be clothed with it: and the innocent shall divide the silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He hath built his house as a moth, and as a keeper he hath made a booth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The rich man when he shall sleep shall take away nothing with him: he shall open his eyes and find nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Poverty like water shall take hold on him, a tempest shall oppress him in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">A burning wind shall take him up, and carry him away, and as a whirlwind shall snatch him from his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And he shall cast upon him, and shall not spare: out of his hand he would willingly flee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He shall clasp his hands upon him, and shall hiss at him, beholding his place.</p>
