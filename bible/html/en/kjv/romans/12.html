<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, [which is] your reasonable service.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what [is] that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think [of himself] more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">So we, [being] many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, [let us prophesy] according to the proportion of faith;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Or ministry, [let us wait] on [our] ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, [let him do it] with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">[Let] love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">[Be] kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">[Be] of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but [rather] give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance [is] mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</p>
