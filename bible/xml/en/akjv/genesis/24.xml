  <verse number="1">And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Abraham said to his oldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray you, your hand under my thigh:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:</verse>
  <verse number="4">But you shall go to my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife to my son Isaac.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the servant said to him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me to this land: must I needs bring your son again to the land from from where you came?</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Abraham said to him, Beware you that you bring not my son thither again.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father’s house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spoke to me, and that swore to me, saying, To your seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife to my son from there.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And if the woman will not be willing to follow you, then you shall be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning that matter.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray you, send me good speed this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water:</verse>
  <verse number="14">And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down your pitcher, I pray you, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give your camels drink also: let the same be she that you have appointed for your servant Isaac; and thereby shall I know that you have showed kindness to my master.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother, with her pitcher on her shoulder.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the damsel was very fair to look on, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray you, drink a little water of your pitcher.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hurried, and let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him drink.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for your camels also, until they have done drinking.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And she hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again to the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;</verse>
  <verse number="23">And said, Whose daughter are you? tell me, I pray you: is there room in your father’s house for us to lodge in?</verse>
  <verse number="24">And she said to him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, which she bore to Nahor.</verse>
  <verse number="25">She said moreover to him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who has not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master’s brothers.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother’s house these things.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban ran out to the man, to the well.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets on his sister’s hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spoke the man to me; that he came to the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And he said, Come in, you blessed of the LORD; why stand you without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men’s feet that were with him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told my errand. And he said, Speak on.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And he said, I am Abraham’s servant.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the LORD has blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he has given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master when she was old: and to him has he given all that he has.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And my master made me swear, saying, You shall not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell:</verse>
  <verse number="38">But you shall go to my father’s house, and to my kindred, and take a wife to my son.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And I said to my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And he said to me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with you, and prosper your way; and you shall take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father’s house:</verse>
  <verse number="41">Then shall you be clear from this my oath, when you come to my kindred; and if they give not you one, you shall be clear from my oath.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And I came this day to the well, and said, O LORD God of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go:</verse>
  <verse number="43">Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin comes forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray you, a little water of your pitcher to drink;</verse>
  <verse number="44">And she say to me, Both drink you, and I will also draw for your camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD has appointed out for my master’s son.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down to the well, and drew water: and I said to her, Let me drink, I pray you.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give your camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter are you? And she said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him: and I put the earring on her face, and the bracelets on her hands.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the right way to take my master’s brother’s daughter to his son.</verse>
  <verse number="49">And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.</verse>
  <verse number="50">Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceeds from the LORD: we cannot speak to you bad or good.</verse>
  <verse number="51">Behold, Rebekah is before you, take her, and go, and let her be your master’s son’s wife, as the LORD has spoken.</verse>
  <verse number="52">And it came to pass, that, when Abraham’s servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="53">And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things.</verse>
  <verse number="54">And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away to my master.</verse>
  <verse number="55">And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.</verse>
  <verse number="56">And he said to them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD has prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.</verse>
  <verse number="57">And they said, We will call the damsel, and inquire at her mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="58">And they called Rebekah, and said to her, Will you go with this man? And she said, I will go.</verse>
  <verse number="59">And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and Abraham’s servant, and his men.</verse>
  <verse number="60">And they blessed Rebekah, and said to her, You are our sister, be you the mother of thousands of millions, and let your seed possess the gate of those which hate them.</verse>
  <verse number="61">And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode on the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah, and went his way.</verse>
  <verse number="62">And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelled in the south country.</verse>
  <verse number="63">And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.</verse>
  <verse number="64">And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.</verse>
  <verse number="65">For she had said to the servant, What man is this that walks in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a veil, and covered herself.</verse>
  <verse number="66">And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.</verse>
  <verse number="67">And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.</verse>
