<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Solomon, the son of David, was strengthened in his reign, and the Lord his God was with him, and he magnified him on high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Solomon instructed the whole of Israel, the tribunes, and the centurions, and the rulers, and the judges over all of Israel, and the leaders of the families.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he went away with the entire multitude to the high place of Gibeon, where the tabernacle of the covenant of the Lord was, which Moses, the servant of God, made in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For David had brought the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim, to the place that he had prepared for it, and where he had pitched a tabernacle for it, that is, in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Also, the altar of brass, which Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had constructed, was there before the tabernacle of the Lord. And so Solomon sought it, with the entire assembly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Solomon ascended to the bronze altar, before the tabernacle of the covenant of the Lord, and he offered upon it one thousand victims.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But behold, during that night God appeared to him, saying, “Request what you wish, so that I may give it to you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Solomon said to God: “You have shown great mercy to my father David. And you have appointed me as king in his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Now therefore, O Lord God, let your word be fulfilled, which you promised to my father David. For you have made me king over your great people, who are as innumerable as the dust of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Give to me wisdom and understanding, so that I may enter and depart before your people. For who is able worthily to judge this, your people, who are so great?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Then God said to Solomon: “Since this is the choice that pleased your heart, and you did not request wealth and substance and glory, nor the lives of those who hate you, nor even many days of life, since instead you requested wisdom and knowledge so that you may be able to judge my people, over whom I have appointed you as king:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">wisdom and knowledge are granted to you. And I will give to you wealth and substance and glory, so that none of the kings either before you or after you will be similar to you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Then Solomon went from the high place of Gibeon to Jerusalem, before the tabernacle of the covenant, and he reigned over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he gathered to himself chariots and horsemen. And they brought to him one thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen. And he caused them to be in the cities of the chariots, and with the king in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the king offered silver and gold in Jerusalem as if they were stones, and cedar trees as if they were sycamores, which grow in the plains in a great multitude.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Then horses were brought to him from Egypt and from Kue, by the negotiators of the king, who went and bought for a price:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">a four-horse chariot for six hundred pieces of silver, and a horse for one hundred fifty. A similar offer to purchase was made known among all the kingdoms of the Hittites, and among the kings of Syria.</p>
