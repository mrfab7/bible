  <verse number="1">Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? Whither hath thy beloved turned him, That we may seek him with thee?’</verse>
  <verse number="2">My beloved is gone down into his garden, To the beds of spices, To feed in the gardens, And to gather lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine, That feedeth among the lilies.’</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, Comely as Jerusalem, Terrible as an army with banners.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Turn away thine eyes from me, For they have overcome me. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, That trail down from Gilead.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes, Which are come up from the washing; Whereof all are paired, And none faileth among them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thy temples are like a pomegranate split open Behind thy veil.</verse>
  <verse number="8">There are threescore queens, And fourscore concubines, And maidens without number.</verse>
  <verse number="9">My dove, my undefiled, is but one; She is the only one of her mother; She is the choice one of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and called her happy; Yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Who is she that looketh forth as the dawn, Fair as the moon, Clear as the sun, Terrible as an army with banners?</verse>
  <verse number="11">I went down into the garden of nuts, To look at the green plants of the valley, To see whether the vine budded, And the pomegranates were in flower.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Before I was aware, my soul set me Upon the chariots of my princely people.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Return, return, O Shulammite; Return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulammite? As it were a dance of two companies.</verse>
