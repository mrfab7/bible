  <verse number="1">Then all Israel gathered themselves to David to Hebron, saying, Behold, we are your bone and your flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, you were he that led out and brought in Israel: and the LORD your God said to you, You shall feed my people Israel, and you shall be ruler over my people Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus; where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, You shall not come here. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which is the city of David.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And David said, Whoever smites the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And David dwelled in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.</verse>
  <verse number="9">So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was with him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighty men.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And they set themselves in the middle of that parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved them by a great deliverance.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines’ garrison was then at Bethlehem.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the three broke through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them, and had a name among the three.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Of the three, he was more honorable than the two; for he was their captain: however, he attained not to the first three.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lion like men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.</verse>
  <verse number="24">These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighty men.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Behold, he was honorable among the thirty, but attained not to the first three: and David set him over his guard.</verse>
