  <verse number="1">“Then the kingdom of heaven shall be like ten virgins, who, taking their lamps, went out to meet the groom and the bride.</verse>
  <verse number="2">But five of them were foolish, and five were prudent.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the five foolish, having brought their lamps, did not take oil with them.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Yet truly, the prudent ones brought the oil, in their containers, with the lamps.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Since the bridegroom was delayed, they all fell asleep, and they were sleeping.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But in the middle of the night, a cry went out: ‘Behold, the groom is arriving. Go out to meet him.’</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then all those virgins rose up and trimmed their lamps.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But the foolish ones said to the wise, ‘Give to us from your oil, for our lamps are being extinguished.’</verse>
  <verse number="9">The prudent responded by saying, ‘Lest perhaps there may not be enough for us and for you, it would be better for you to go to the vendors and buy some for yourselves.’</verse>
  <verse number="10">But while they were going to buy it, the groom arrived. And those who were prepared entered with him to the wedding, and the door was closed.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Yet truly, at the very end, the remaining virgins also arrived, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open to us.’</verse>
  <verse number="12">But he responded by saying, ‘Amen I say to you, I do not know you.’</verse>
  <verse number="13">And so you must be vigilant, because you do not know the day or the hour.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For it is like a man setting out on a long journey, who called his servants and delivered to them his goods.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And to one he gave five talents, and to another two, yet to another he gave one, to each according to his own ability. And promptly, he set out.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then he who had received five talents went out, and he made use of these, and he gained another five.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And similarly, he who had received two gained another two.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But he who had received one, going out, dug into the earth, and he hid the money of his lord.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Yet truly, after a long time, the lord of those servants returned and he settled accounts with them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And when he who had received five talents approached, he brought another five talents, saying: ‘Lord, you delivered five talents to me. Behold, I have increased it by another five.’</verse>
  <verse number="21">His lord said to him: ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. Since you have been faithful over a few things, I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the gladness of your lord.’</verse>
  <verse number="22">Then he who had received two talents also approached, and he said: ‘Lord, you delivered two talents to me. Behold, I have gained another two.’</verse>
  <verse number="23">His lord said to him: ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. Since you have been faithful over a few things, I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the gladness of your lord.’</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then he who had received one talent, approaching, said: ‘Lord, I know that you are a hard man. You reap where you have not sown, and gather where you have not scattered.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And so, being afraid, I went out and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.’</verse>
  <verse number="26">But his lord said to him in response: ‘You evil and lazy servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not scattered.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Therefore, you should have deposited my money with the bankers, and then, at my arrival, at least I would have received what is mine with interest.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And so, take the talent away from him and give it the one who has ten talents.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For to everyone who has, more shall be given, and he shall have in abundance. But from him who has not, even what he seems to have, shall be taken away.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And cast that useless servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’</verse>
  <verse number="31">But when the Son of man will have arrived in his majesty, and all the Angels with him, then he will sit upon the seat of his majesty.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And all the nations shall be gathered together before him. And he shall separate them from one another, just as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And he shall station the sheep, indeed, on his right, but the goats on his left.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Then the King shall say to those who will be on his right: ‘Come, you blessed of my Father. Possess the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="35">For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in;</verse>
  <verse number="36">naked, and you covered me; sick, and you visited me; I was in prison, and you came to me.’</verse>
  <verse number="37">Then the just will answer him, saying: ‘Lord, when have we see you hungry, and fed you; thirsty, and given you drink?</verse>
  <verse number="38">And when have we seen you a stranger, and taken you in? Or naked, and covered you?</verse>
  <verse number="39">Or when did we see you sick, or in prison, and visit to you?’</verse>
  <verse number="40">And in response, the King shall say to them, ‘Amen I say to you, whenever you did this for one of these, the least of my brothers, you did it for me.’</verse>
  <verse number="41">Then he shall also say, to those who will be on his left: ‘Depart from me, you accursed ones, into the eternal fire, which was prepared for the devil and his angels.</verse>
  <verse number="42">For I was hungry, and you did not give me to eat; I was thirsty, and you did not give me to drink;</verse>
  <verse number="43">I was a stranger and you did not take me in; naked, and you did not cover me; sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.’</verse>
  <verse number="44">Then they will also answer him, saying: ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to you?’</verse>
  <verse number="45">Then he shall respond to them by saying: ‘Amen I say to you, whenever you did not do it to one of these least, neither did you do it to me.’</verse>
  <verse number="46">And these shall go into eternal punishment, but the just shall go into eternal life.”</verse>
