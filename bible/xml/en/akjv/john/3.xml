<chapter book="John" number="3" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</verse>
  <verse number="2">The same came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that you do, except God be with him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Nicodemus said to him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="6">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Marvel not that I said to you, You must be born again.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The wind blows where it wants, and you hear the sound thereof, but can not tell from where it comes, and where it goes: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Jesus answered and said to him, Are you a master of Israel, and know not these things?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Truly, truly, I say to you, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and you receive not our witness.</verse>
  <verse number="12">If I have told you earthly things, and you believe not, how shall you believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?</verse>
  <verse number="13">And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</verse>
  <verse number="15">That whoever believes in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He that believes on him is not condemned: but he that believes not is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For every one that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are worked in God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For John was not yet cast into prison.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bore witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him.</verse>
  <verse number="27">John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="28">You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</verse>
  <verse number="29">He that has the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</verse>
  <verse number="30">He must increase, but I must decrease.</verse>
  <verse number="31">He that comes from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaks of the earth: he that comes from heaven is above all.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies; and no man receives his testimony.</verse>
  <verse number="33">He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God: for God gives not the Spirit by measure to him.</verse>
  <verse number="35">The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="36">He that believes on the Son has everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God stays on him.</verse>
