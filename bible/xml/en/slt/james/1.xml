  <verse number="1">James, servant of God and the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes in the dispersion, health.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Deem all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into various trials;</verse>
  <verse number="3">Knowing that the proof of your faith works patience.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And let patience have a perfect work, that ye be perfect and entire, being left behind in nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="5">If any of you is forsaken of wisdom, let him ask of God, giving to all plainly, blaming not; and it shall be given him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And let him ask in faith, being at variance in nothing. For he being at variance is like the surge of the sea being moved by the wind and put in motion.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="8">A man divided in opinion unsteady in all his ways.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And let the humble brother boast in his elevation:</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the rich, in his humiliation: for as the flower of the grass he shall pass by.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the sun sprang up with heat, and dried up the grass, and its flower fell out, and the decorum of its face was destroyed: so also shall the rich be dried up in his goings.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Happy the man who endures temptation: for being tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to them loving him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Let none say being tempted, that I am tempted of God: for God is not tempted of evils, and he tempts none:</verse>
  <verse number="14">And each is tempted from his own lust, being drawn out, and decoyed.</verse>
  <verse number="15">So then lust conceiving, brings forth sin: and sin performed, produces death.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Be not led astray, my dearly beloved brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Every good donation and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom not one change, or shadow of turning.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Having willed he brought forth by the word of truth, for us to be some first fruit of his creatures.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Wherefore, my dearly beloved brethren, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger:</verse>
  <verse number="20">For man’s anger works not the justice of God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Wherefore having put away all sordid avarice, and excess of wickedness, in meekness receive the implanted word, able to save your souls.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For if any is a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like a man observing the face of his creation in a mirror:</verse>
  <verse number="24">For he observed himself, and went away, and straightway forgot of what kind he was.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he having stooped into the perfect law of liberty, and remained, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of work, he shall be happy in his doing.</verse>
  <verse number="26">If any among you seem to be religious, bridling not his tongue, but deceiving his heart, the religion of this one vain.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Religion pure and unpolluted before God and the Father is this, To take a view of the orphans and widows in their pressure, to keep himself free from stain from the world.</verse>
