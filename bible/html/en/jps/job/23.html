<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Even to-day is my complaint bitter; My hand is become heavy because of my groaning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Oh that I knew where I might find Him, That I might come even to His seat!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I would order my cause before Him, And fill my mouth with arguments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I would know the words which He would answer me, And understand what He would say unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Would He contend with me in His great power? Nay; but He would give heed unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">There the upright might reason with Him; So should I be delivered for ever from my Judge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Behold, I go forward, but He is not there, And backward, but I cannot perceive Him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">On the left hand, when He doth work, but I cannot behold Him, He turneth Himself to the right hand, but I cannot see Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For He knoweth the way that I take; When He hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My foot hath held fast to His steps, His way have I kept, and turned not aside.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I have not gone back from the commandment of His lips; I have treasured up the words of His mouth more than my necessary food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But He is at one with Himself, and who can turn Him? And what His soul desireth, even that He doeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For He will perform that which is appointed for me; And many such things are with Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Therefore am I affrighted at His presence; When I consider, I am afraid of Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Yea, God hath made my heart faint, And the Almighty hath affrighted me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Because I was not cut off before the darkness, Neither did He cover the thick darkness from my face.</p>
