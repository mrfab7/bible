  <verse number="1">Judge not, that ye be not judged.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me cast out the mote out of thine eye; and lo, the beam is in thine own eye?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast your pearls before the swine, lest haply they trample them under their feet, and turn and rend you.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:</verse>
  <verse number="8">for every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Or what man is there of you, who, if his son shall ask him for a loaf, will give him a stone;</verse>
  <verse number="10">or if he shall ask for a fish, will give him a serpent?</verse>
  <verse number="11">If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</verse>
  <verse number="12">All things therefore whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even so do ye also unto them: for this is the law and the prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Enter ye in by the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many be they that enter in thereby.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For narrow is the gate, and straitened the way, that leadeth unto life, and few be they that find it.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravening wolves.</verse>
  <verse number="16">By their fruits ye shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</verse>
  <verse number="17">Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but the corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="18">A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Therefore by their fruits ye shall know them.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy by thy name, and by thy name cast out devils, and by thy name do many mighty works?</verse>
  <verse number="23">And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Every one therefore which heareth these words of mine, and doeth them, shall be likened unto a wise man, which built his house upon the rock:</verse>
  <verse number="25">and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon the rock.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And every one that heareth these words of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:</verse>
  <verse number="27">and the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and smote upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And it came to pass, when Jesus ended these words, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching:</verse>
  <verse number="29">for he taught them as one having authority, and not as their scribes.</verse>
