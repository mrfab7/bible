<div class="chapter" data-book="Deuteronomy" data-chapter="8" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">All the commands which I command thee this day ye shall watch to do, so that ye shall live and multiply and go in and possess the land which Jehovah sware to your fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And remember thou all the way which Jehovah thy God caused thee to go this forty years in the desert in order to humble thee, to try thee, to know what is in thy heart, whether thou shalt watch his commands or not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he will humble thee, and cause thee to hunger, and will give thee to eat manna which thou knewest not, and thy fathers knew not; so that he caused thee to know that upon bread only man shall not live, but upon all going out of the mouth of Jehovah shall man live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thy garments decayed not from thee, and thy feet swelled not this forty years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And know thou with thy heart that as a man will chastise his son, Jehovah thy God chastises thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And watch thou the commands of Jehovah thy God, to go in his ways and to fear him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For Jehovah thy God brings thee to a good land, a land of torrents of water, fountains, and depths going forth in the valley and in the mountain;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">A land of wheat and barley and the vine and the fig tree and the pomegranate, a land of the olive tree, of oil and honey;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A land where thou shalt eat bread in it not with poverty; thou shalt not want any thing in it; a land whose stones, iron, and out of its mountains thou shalt hew out brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And thou atest and wert satisfied, and didst bless Jehovah thy God for the good land which he gave to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Watch to thyself lest thou shalt forget Jehovah thy God, not watching his commands and his judgments and his laws which I command thee this day:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Lest thou shalt eat and thou wert satisfied, and thou wilt build good houses and thou dwelt;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And thy cattle and thy sheep shall multiply, and thy silver and thy gold shall multiply to thee, and all which is in thee shall multiply;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And thy heart was lifted up and thou didst forget Jehovah thy God bringing thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He causing thee to go in the great and fearful desert, the fiery serpent and the scorpion, and a thirsty land, where is no water: he bringing forth to thee water from the rock of flint;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He giving thee to eat manna in the desert which thy fathers knew not, in order to humble thee, and in order to try thee to do thee good in thy lost state:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And thou saidst in thy heart, My strength and the bone of my handmade for me this wealth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And remember Jehovah thy God; for he gave to thee strength to make wealth in order to set up his covenant, which he sware to our fathers, as this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And it was, if forgetting, thou shalt forget Jehovah thy God, and thou wentest after other gods, and served them and worshipped to them, I testified against you this day, that perishing, ye shall perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">As the nations which Jehovah destroys before you, so shall ye be destroyed, because ye will not hear to the voice of Jehovah your God.</p>
