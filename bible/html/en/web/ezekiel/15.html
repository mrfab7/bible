<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Shall wood be taken of it to make any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire has devoured both its ends, and its midst is burned: is it profitable for any work?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be meet for any work!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I will set my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire, but the fire shall devour them; and you shall know that I am Yahweh, when I set my face against them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, says the Lord Yahweh.</p>
