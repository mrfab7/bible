  <verse number="1">And it cometh to pass, at the time of the turn of the year—at the time of the going out of the messengers—that Joab leadeth out the force of the host, and destroyeth the land of the sons of Ammon, and cometh in and beseigeth Rabbah—David is abiding in Jerusalem—and Joab smiteth Rabbah, and breaketh it down.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And David taketh the crown of their king from off his head, and findeth it in weight a talent of gold, and in it a precious stone, and it is on the head of David: and spoil of the city he hath brought out very much,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and the people who are in it he hath brought out, and setteth to the saw, and to cutting instruments of iron, and to axes; and thus doth David to all cities of the sons of Ammon, and David turneth back, and all the people, to Jerusalem.</verse>
