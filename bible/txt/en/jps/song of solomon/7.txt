1	How beautiful are thy steps in sandals, O prince’s daughter! The roundings of thy thighs are like the links of a chain, The work of the hands of a skilled workman.
2	Thy navel is like a round goblet, Wherein no mingled wine is wanting; Thy belly is like a heap of wheat Set about with lilies.
3	Thy two breasts are like two fawns That are twins of a gazelle.
4	Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; Thine eyes as the pools in Heshbon, By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon Which looketh toward Damascus.
5	Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, And the hair of thy head like purple; The king is held captive in the tresses thereof.
6	How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!
7	This thy stature is like to a palm-tree, And thy breasts to clusters of grapes.
8	I said: ‘I will climb up into the palm-tree, I will take hold of the branches thereof; And let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, And the smell of thy countenance like apples;
9	And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine, That glideth down smoothly for my beloved, Moving gently the lips of those that are asleep.’
10	I am my beloved’s, And his desire is toward me.
11	Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; Let us lodge in the villages.
12	Let us get up early to the vineyards; Let us see whether the vine hath budded, Whether the vine-blossom be opened, And the pomegranates be in flower; There will I give thee my love.
13	The mandrakes give forth fragrance, And at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, New and old, Which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
