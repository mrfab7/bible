<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whoever thou art, that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest, doest the same things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">But we are sure that the judgment of God is according to truth, against them who commit such things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and forbearance, and long-suffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But after thy hardness and impenitent heart, treasurest up to thyself wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Who will render to every man according to his deeds:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">To them who by patient continuance in well-doing, seek for glory, and honor, and immortality; eternal life:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But to them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness; indignation and wrath:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But glory, honor, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For there is no respect of persons with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For as many as have sinned without law, shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, these having not the law, are a law to themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing testimony, and their thoughts the mean while accusing, or else excusing one another)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And knowest his will, and approvest the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them who are in darkness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, who hast the form of knowledge, and of the truth in the law:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Thou therefore who teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonorest thou God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles, through you, as it is written.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For circumcision verily profiteth, if thou keepest the law; but if thou art a breaker of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Therefore, if the uncircumcision keepeth the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfilleth the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision dost transgress the law?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For he is not a Jew, who is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.</p>
