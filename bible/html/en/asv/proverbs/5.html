<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, attend unto my wisdom; Incline thine ear to my understanding:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">That thou mayest preserve discretion, And that thy lips may keep knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And her mouth is smoother than oil:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But in the end she is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Her feet go down to death; Her steps take hold on Sheol;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">So that she findeth not the level path of life: Her ways are unstable, and she knoweth it not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me, And depart not from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Remove thy way far from her, And come not nigh the door of her house;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Lest thou give thine honor unto others, And thy years unto the cruel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, And thy labors be in the house of an alien,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And thou mourn at thy latter end, When thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And say, How have I hated instruction, And my heart despised reproof;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I was well-nigh in all evil In the midst of the assembly and congregation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Drink waters out of thine own cistern, And running waters out of thine own well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Should thy springs be dispersed abroad, And streams of water in the streets?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Let them be for thyself alone, And not for strangers with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Let thy fountain be blessed; And rejoice in the wife of thy youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">As a loving hind and a pleasant doe, Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; And be thou ravished always with her love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, And embrace the bosom of a foreigner?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah; And he maketh level all his paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">His own iniquities shall take the wicked, And he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He shall die for lack of instruction; And in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</p>
