<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the earth was of one tongue, and of the same speech.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And when they removed from the east, they found a plain in the land of Sennaar, and dwelt in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And each one said to his neighbour: Come, let us make brick, and bake them of stones, and slime instead of mortar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they said: Come, let us make a city and a tower, the top whereof may reach to heaven: and let us make our name famous before we be scattered abroad into all lands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the Lord came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of Adam were building.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he said: Behold, it is one people, and all have one tongue: and they have begun to do this, neither will they leave off from their designs, till they accomplish them in deed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Come ye, therefore, let us go down, and there may not understand one another’s speech.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And so the Lord scattered them from that place into all lands, and they ceased to build the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And therefore the name thereof was called Babel, because there the language of the whole earth was confounded: and from thence the Lord scattered them abroad upon the face of all countries.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And Aran died before Thare his father, in the land of his nativity in Ur of the Chaldees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Abram and Nachor married wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai: and the name of Nachor’s wife, Melcha, the daughter of Aran, father of Melcha, and father of Jescha.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And Sarai was barren, and had no children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And Thare took Abram, his son, and Lot the son of Aran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, the wife of Abram his son, and brought them out of Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Chanaan: and they came as far as Haran, and dwelt there.</p>
