<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="5" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">It is universally reported [that there is] fornication among you, and such fornication as [is] not even among the nations, so that one should have his father’s wife.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And ye are puffed up, and ye have not rather mourned, in order that he that has done this deed might be taken away out of the midst of you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For I, [as] absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged as present,</verse>
  <verse number="4">[to deliver,] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ (ye and my spirit being gathered together, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ), him that has so wrought this:</verse>
  <verse number="5">to deliver him, [I say,] [being] such, to Satan for destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Your boasting [is] not good. Do ye not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, according as ye are unleavened. For also our passover, Christ, has been sacrificed;</verse>
  <verse number="8">so that let us celebrate the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and wickedness, but with unleavened [bread] of sincerity and truth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I have written to you in the epistle not to mix with fornicators;</verse>
  <verse number="10">not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the avaricious and rapacious, or idolaters, since [then] ye should go out of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But now I have written to you, if any one called brother be fornicator, or avaricious, or idolater, or abusive, or a drunkard, or rapacious, not to mix with [him]; with such a one not even to eat.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For what have I [to do] with judging those outside also? ye, do not ye judge them that are within?</verse>
  <verse number="13">But those without God judges. Remove the wicked person from amongst yourselves.</verse>
