<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Samuel" data-chapter="12" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Samuel said to all Israel, Behold, I have listened to your voice in all that you said to me, and have made a king over you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And now, behold, the king walks before you: and I am old and gray headed; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have walked before you from my childhood to this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind my eyes therewith? and I will restore it you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they said, You have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us, neither have you taken ought of any man’s hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And he said to them, The LORD is witness against you, and his anointed is witness this day, that you have not found ought in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Samuel said to the people, It is the LORD that advanced Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did to you and to your fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And when they forgot the LORD their God, he sold them into the hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And they cried to the LORD, and said, We have sinned, because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side, and you dwelled safe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And when you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came against you, you said to me, No; but a king shall reign over us: when the LORD your God was your king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Now therefore behold the king whom you have chosen, and whom you have desired! and, behold, the LORD has set a king over you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If you will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice, and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both you and also the king that reigns over you continue following the LORD your God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But if you will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD will do before your eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call to the LORD, and he shall send thunder and rain; that you may perceive and see that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight of the LORD, in asking you a king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">So Samuel called to the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for your servants to the LORD your God, that we die not: for we have added to all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Samuel said to the people, Fear not: you have done all this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And turn you not aside: for then should you go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name’s sake: because it has pleased the LORD to make you his people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good and the right way:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for consider how great things he has done for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But if you shall still do wickedly, you shall be consumed, both you and your king.</p>
