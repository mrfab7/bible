<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: The appointed seasons of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are My appointed seasons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of work; it is a sabbath unto the LORD in all your dwellings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">These are the appointed seasons of the LORD, even holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their appointed season.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at dusk, is the LORDâ€™S passover.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD; seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In the first day ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days; in the seventh day is a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the LORD spoke unto Moses saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye are come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you; on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And in the day when ye wave the sheaf, ye shall offer a he-lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt-offering unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the meal-offering thereof shall be two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD for a sweet savour; and the drink-offering thereof shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears, until this selfsame day, until ye have brought the offering of your God; it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the day of rest, from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the waving; seven weeks shall there be complete;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">even unto the morrow after the seventh week shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall present a new meal-offering unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Ye shall bring out of your dwellings two wave-loaves of two tenth parts of an ephah; they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baked with leaven, for first-fruits unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And ye shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams; they shall be a burnt-offering unto the LORD, with their meal-offering, and their drink-offerings, even an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And ye shall offer one he-goat for a sin-offering, and two he-lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace-offerings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the first-fruits for a wave-offering before the LORD, with the two lambs; they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And ye shall make proclamation on the selfsame day; there shall be a holy convocation unto you; ye shall do no manner of servile work; it is a statute for ever in all your dwellings throughout your generations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corner of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest; thou shalt leave them for the poor, and for the stranger: I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: In the seventh month, in the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest unto you, a memorial proclaimed with the blast of horns, a holy convocation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Ye shall do no manner of servile work; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Howbeit on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day of atonement; there shall be a holy convocation unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And ye shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day of atonement, to make atonement for you before the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that same day, he shall be cut off from his people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any manner of work in that same day, that soul will I destroy from among his people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Ye shall do no manner of work; it is a statute for ever throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">It shall be unto you a sabbath of solemn rest, and ye shall afflict your souls; in the ninth day of the month at even, from even unto even, shall ye keep your sabbath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Speak unto the children of Israel, saying: On the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the feast of tabernacles for seven days unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">On the first day shall be a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Seven days ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD; on the eighth day shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD; it is a day of solemn assembly; ye shall do no manner of servile work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">These are the appointed seasons of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to bring an offering made by fire unto the LORD, a burnt-offering, and a meal-offering, a sacrifice, and drink-offerings, each on its own day;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill-offerings, which ye give unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Howbeit on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruits of the land, ye shall keep the feast of the LORD seven days; on the first day shall be a solemn rest, and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And ye shall take you on the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm-trees, and boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook, and ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God seven days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the year; it is a statute for ever in your generations; ye shall keep it in the seventh month.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are home-born in Israel shall dwell in booths;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the appointed seasons of the LORD.</p>
