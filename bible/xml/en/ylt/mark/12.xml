  <verse number="1">And he began to speak to them in similes: ‘A man planted a vineyard, and put a hedge around, and digged an under-wine-vat, and built a tower, and gave it out to husbandmen, and went abroad;</verse>
  <verse number="2">and he sent unto the husbandmen at the due time a servant, that from the husbandmen he may receive from the fruit of the vineyard,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and they, having taken him, did severely beat him, and did send him away empty.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And again he sent unto them another servant, and at that one having cast stones, they wounded him in the head, and sent away—dishonoured.</verse>
  <verse number="5">‘And again he sent another, and that one they killed; and many others, some beating, and some killing.</verse>
  <verse number="6">‘Having yet therefore one son—his beloved—he sent also him unto them last, saying—They will reverence my son;</verse>
  <verse number="7">and those husbandmen said among themselves—This is the heir, come, we may kill him, and ours shall be the inheritance;</verse>
  <verse number="8">and having taken him, they did kill, and cast him forth without the vineyard.</verse>
  <verse number="9">‘What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And this Writing did ye not read: A stone that the builders rejected, it did become the head of a corner:</verse>
  <verse number="11">from the Lord was this, and it is wonderful in our eyes.’</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they were seeking to lay hold on him, and they feared the multitude, for they knew that against them he spake the simile, and having left him, they went away;</verse>
  <verse number="13">and they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, that they may ensnare him in discourse,</verse>
  <verse number="14">and they having come, say to him, ‘Teacher, we have known that thou art true, and thou art not caring for any one, for thou dost not look to the face of men, but in truth the way of God dost teach; is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not? may we give, or may we not give?’</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, ‘Why me do ye tempt? bring me a denary, that I may see;’</verse>
  <verse number="16">and they brought, and he saith to them, ‘Whose is this image, and the inscription?’ and they said to him, ‘Caesar’s;’</verse>
  <verse number="17">and Jesus answering said to them, ‘Give back the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God;’ and they did wonder at him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the Sadducees come unto him, who say there is not a rising again, and they questioned him, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="19">‘Teacher, Moses wrote to us, that if any one’s brother may die, and may leave a wife, and may leave no children, that his brother may take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="20">‘There were then seven brothers, and the first took a wife, and dying, he left no seed;</verse>
  <verse number="21">and the second took her, and died, neither left he seed, and the third in like manner,</verse>
  <verse number="22">and the seven took her, and left no seed, last of all died also the woman;</verse>
  <verse number="23">in the rising again, then, whenever they may rise, of which of them shall she be wife—for the seven had her as wife?’</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Jesus answering said to them, ‘Do ye not because of this go astray, not knowing the Writings, nor the power of God?</verse>
  <verse number="25">for when they may rise out of the dead, they neither marry nor are they given in marriage, but are as messengers who are in the heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And concerning the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the Book of Moses (at The Bush), how God spake to him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;</verse>
  <verse number="27">he is not the God of dead men, but a God of living men; ye then go greatly astray.’</verse>
  <verse number="28">And one of the scribes having come near, having heard them disputing, knowing that he answered them well, questioned him, ‘Which is the first command of all?’</verse>
  <verse number="29">and Jesus answered him—‘The first of all the commands is, Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is one;</verse>
  <verse number="30">and thou shalt love the Lord thy God out of all thy heart, and out of thy soul, and out of all thine understanding, and out of all thy strength—this is the first command;</verse>
  <verse number="31">and the second is like it, this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;—greater than these there is no other command.’</verse>
  <verse number="32">And the scribe said to him, ‘Well, Teacher, in truth thou hast spoken that there is one God, and there is none other but He;</verse>
  <verse number="33">and to love Him out of all the heart, and out of all the understanding, and out of all the soul, and out of all the strength, and to love one’s neighbour as one’s self, is more than all the whole burnt-offerings and the sacrifices.’</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Jesus, having seen him that he answered with understanding, said to him, ‘Thou art not far from the reign of God;’ and no one any more durst question him.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And Jesus answering said, teaching in the temple, ‘How say the scribes that the Christ is son of David?</verse>
  <verse number="36">for David himself said in the Holy Spirit, The Lord said to my lord, Sit thou on My right hand, till I place thine enemies—thy footstool;</verse>
  <verse number="37">therefore David himself saith of him Lord, and whence is he his son?’ And the great multitude were hearing him gladly,</verse>
  <verse number="38">and he was saying to them in his teaching, ‘Beware of the scribes, who will in long robes to walk, and love salutations in the market-places,</verse>
  <verse number="39">and first seats in the synagogues, and first couches in suppers,</verse>
  <verse number="40">who are devouring the widows’ houses, and for a pretence are making long prayers; these shall receive more abundant judgment.’</verse>
  <verse number="41">And Jesus having sat down over-against the treasury, was beholding how the multitude do put brass into the treasury, and many rich were putting in much,</verse>
  <verse number="42">and having come, a poor widow did put in two mites, which are a farthing.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And having called near his disciples, he saith to them, ‘Verily I say to you, that this poor widow hath put in more than all those putting into the treasury;</verse>
  <verse number="44">for all, out of their abundance, put in, but she, out of her want, all that she had put in—all her living.’</verse>
