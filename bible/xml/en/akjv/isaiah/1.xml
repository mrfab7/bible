<chapter book="Isaiah" number="1" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but Israel does not know, my people does not consider.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger, they are gone away backward.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Why should you be stricken any more? you will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</verse>
  <verse number="6">From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Except the LORD of hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrah.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.</verse>
  <verse number="11">To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.</verse>
  <verse number="12">When you come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination to me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates: they are a trouble to me; I am weary to bear them.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And when you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you: yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;</verse>
  <verse number="17">Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Come now, and let us reason together, said the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</verse>
  <verse number="19">If you be willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land:</verse>
  <verse number="20">But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD has spoken it.</verse>
  <verse number="21">How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Your silver is become dross, your wine mixed with water:</verse>
  <verse number="23">Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loves gifts, and follows after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come to them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore said the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries, and avenge me of my enemies:</verse>
  <verse number="25">And I will turn my hand on you, and purely purge away your dross, and take away all your tin:</verse>
  <verse number="26">And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counsellors as at the beginning: afterward you shall be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden that has no water.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the strong shall be as wick, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.</verse>
