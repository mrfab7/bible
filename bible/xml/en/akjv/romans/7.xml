<chapter book="Romans" number="7" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Know you not, brothers, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?</verse>
  <verse number="2">For the woman which has an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he lives; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.</verse>
  <verse number="3">So then if, while her husband lives, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Why, my brothers, you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit to death.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</verse>
  <verse number="7">What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, worked in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be to death.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Why the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Was then that which is good made death to me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If then I do that which I would not, I consent to the law that it is good.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwells no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</verse>
  <verse number="23">But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</verse>
  <verse number="24">O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</verse>
  <verse number="25">I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</verse>
