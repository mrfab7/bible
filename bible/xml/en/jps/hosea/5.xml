  <verse number="1">Hear this, O ye priests, And attend, ye house of Israel, And give ear, O house of the king, For unto you pertaineth the judgment; For ye have been a snare on Mizpah, And a net spread upon Tabor.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And they that fall away are gone deep in making slaughter; And I am rejected of them all.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I, even I, know Ephraim, And Israel is not hid from Me; For now, O Ephraim, thou hast committed harlotry, Israel is defiled.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Their doings will not suffer them To return unto their God; For the spirit of harlotry is within them, And they know not the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But the pride of Israel shall testify to his face; And Israel and Ephraim shall stumble in their iniquity, Judah also shall stumble with them.</verse>
  <verse number="6">With their flocks and with their herds they shall go To seek the LORD, but they shall not find Him; He hath withdrawn Himself from them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They have dealt treacherously against the LORD, For they have begotten strange children; Now shall the new moon devour them with their portions.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Blow ye the horn in Gibeah, And the trumpet in Ramah; Sound an alarm at Beth-aven: ‘Behind thee, O Benjamin!’</verse>
  <verse number="9">Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke; Among the tribes of Israel do I make known that which shall surely be.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark; I will pour out My wrath upon them like water.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Oppressed is Ephraim, crushed in his right; Because he willingly walked after filth.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Therefore am I unto Ephraim as a moth, And to the house of Judah as rottenness.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And when Ephraim saw his sickness, And Judah his wound, Ephraim went to Assyria, And sent to King Contentious; But he is not able to heal you, Neither shall he cure you of your wound.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, And as a young lion to the house of Judah; I, even I, will tear and go away, I will take away, and there shall be none to deliver.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I will go and return to My place, Till they acknowledge their guilt, and seek My face; In their trouble they will seek Me earnestly:</verse>
