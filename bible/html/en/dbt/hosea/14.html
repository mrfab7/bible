<p class="verse" data-verse="1">O Israel, return unto Jehovah thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Take with you words, and turn to Jehovah; say unto him, Forgive all iniquity, and receive [us] graciously; so will we render the calves of our lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Assyria shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, [Thou art] our God; because in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; for mine anger is turned away from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall blossom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">His shoots shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive-tree, and his smell as Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They shall return and sit under his shadow; they shall revive [as] corn, and blossom as the vine: the renown thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Ephraim [shall say], What have I to do any more with idols? (I answer [him], and I will observe him.) I am like a green fir-tree.â€”From me is thy fruit found.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? intelligent, and he shall know them? For the ways of Jehovah are right, and the just shall walk in them; but the transgressors shall fall therein.</p>
