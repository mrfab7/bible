<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Agrippa said unto Paul, ‘It is permitted to thee to speak for thyself;’ then Paul having stretched forth the hand, was making a defence:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">‘Concerning all things of which I am accused by Jews, king Agrippa, I have thought myself happy, being about to make a defence before thee to-day,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">especially knowing thee to be acquainted with all things—both customs and questions—among Jews; wherefore, I beseech thee, patiently to hear me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">‘The manner of my life then, indeed, from youth—which from the beginning was among my nation, in Jerusalem—know do all the Jews,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">knowing me before from the first, (if they may be willing to testify,) that after the most exact sect of our worship, I lived a Pharisee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and now for the hope of the promise made to the fathers by God, I have stood judged,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">to which our twelve tribes, intently night and day serving, do hope to come, concerning which hope I am accused, king Agrippa, by the Jews;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">why is it judged incredible with you, if God doth raise the dead?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I, indeed, therefore, thought with myself, that against the name of Jesus of Nazareth it behoved me many things to do,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">which also I did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I in prison did shut up, from the chief priests having received the authority; they also being put to death, I gave my vote against them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and in every synagogue, often punishing them, I was constraining them to speak evil, being also exceedingly mad against them, I was also persecuting them even unto strange cities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">‘In which things, also, going on to Damascus—with authority and commission from the chief priests—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">at mid-day, I saw in the way, O king, out of heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me a light—and those going on with me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and we all having fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why me dost thou persecute? hard for thee against pricks to kick!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">‘And I said, Who art thou, Lord? and he said, I am Jesus whom thou dost persecute;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">but rise, and stand upon thy feet, for for this I appeared to thee, to appoint thee an officer and a witness both of the things thou didst see, and of the things in which I will appear to thee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">delivering thee from the people, and the nations, to whom now I send thee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light, and from the authority of the Adversary unto God, for their receiving forgiveness of sins, and a lot among those having been sanctified, by faith that is toward me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">‘Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">but to those in Damascus first, and to those in Jerusalem, to all the region also of Judea, and to the nations, I was preaching to reform, and to turn back unto God, doing works worthy of reformation;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">because of these things the Jews—having caught me in the temple—were endeavouring to kill me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">‘Having obtained, therefore, help from God, till this day, I have stood witnessing both to small and to great, saying nothing besides the things that both the prophets and Moses spake of as about to come,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">that the Christ is to suffer, whether first by a rising from the dead, he is about to proclaim light to the people and to the nations.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And, he thus making a defence, Festus with a loud voice said, ‘Thou art mad, Paul; much learning doth turn thee mad;’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">and he saith, ‘I am not mad, most noble Festus, but of truth and soberness the sayings I speak forth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">for the king doth know concerning these things, before whom also I speak boldly, for none of these things, I am persuaded, are hidden from him; for this thing hath not been done in a corner;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">thou dost believe, king Agrippa, the prophets? I have known that thou dost believe!’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And Agrippa said unto Paul, ‘In a little thou dost persuade me to become a Christian!’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">and Paul said, ‘I would have wished to God, both in a little, and in much, not only thee, but also all those hearing me to-day, to become such as I also am—except these bonds.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And, he having spoken these things, the king rose up, and the governor, Bernice also, and those sitting with them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">and having withdrawn, they were speaking unto one another, saying—‘This man doth nothing worthy of death or of bonds;’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">and Agrippa said to Festus, ‘This man might have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.’</p>
