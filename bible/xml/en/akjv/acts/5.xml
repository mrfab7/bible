  <verse number="1">But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,</verse>
  <verse number="2">And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Whiles it remained, was it not your own? and after it was sold, was it not in your own power? why have you conceived this thing in your heart? you have not lied to men, but to God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and buried him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Peter answered to her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much? And she said, Yes, for so much.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then Peter said to her, How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have buried your husband are at the door, and shall carry you out.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And great fear came on all the church, and on as many as heard these things.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders worked among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And of the rest dared no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)</verse>
  <verse number="15">So that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">There came also a multitude out of the cities round about to Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,</verse>
  <verse number="18">And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="20">Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned and told,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this would grow.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And when they had brought them, they set them before the council: and the high priest asked them,</verse>
  <verse number="28">Saying, Did not we straightly command you that you should not teach in this name? and, behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this man’s blood on us.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to obey God rather than men.</verse>
  <verse number="30">The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you slew and hanged on a tree.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Him has God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God has given to them that obey him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took counsel to slay them.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;</verse>
  <verse number="35">And said to them, You men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you intend to do as touching these men.</verse>
  <verse number="36">For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="37">After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And now I say to you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nothing:</verse>
  <verse number="39">But if it be of God, you cannot overthrow it; lest haply you be found even to fight against God.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.</verse>
