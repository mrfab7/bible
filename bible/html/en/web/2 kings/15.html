<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem: and his mother’s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his father Amaziah had done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">However the high places were not taken away: the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Yahweh struck the king, so that he was a leper to the day of his death, and lived in a separate house. Jotham the king’s son was over the household, judging the people of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Now the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Then Menahem struck Tiphsah, and all who were therein, and its borders, from Tirzah: because they didn’t open to him, therefore he struck it; and all the women therein who were with child he ripped up.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="19">There came against the land Pul the king of Assyria; and Menahem gave Pul one thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and didn’t stay there in the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Now the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, aren’t they written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his place.</p>
