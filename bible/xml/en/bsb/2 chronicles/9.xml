<chapter book="2 Chronicles" number="9" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now when the queen of Sheba heard about the fame of Solomon, she came to test him with difficult questions. She arrived in Jerusalem with a very large caravan—with camels bearing spices, gold in abundance, and precious stones. And she came to Solomon and spoke with him about all that was on her mind.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too difficult for him to explain.</verse>
  <verse number="3">When the queen of Sheba saw the wisdom of Solomon, the palace he had built,</verse>
  <verse number="4">the food at his table, the seating of his servants, the service and attire of his attendants, the attire of his cupbearers, and the burnt offerings he presented at the house of the LORD, it took her breath away.</verse>
  <verse number="5">She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your words and wisdom is true.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But I did not believe the reports until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, not half of the greatness of your wisdom was told to me. You have far exceeded the report I heard.</verse>
  <verse number="7">How blessed are your men! How blessed are these servants of yours who stand continually before you and hear your wisdom!</verse>
  <verse number="8">Blessed be the LORD your God, who has delighted in you to set you on His throne to be king for the LORD your God. Because your God loved Israel enough to establish them forever, He has made you king over them to carry out justice and righteousness.”</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, a great quantity of spices, and precious stones. There had never been such spices as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.</verse>
  <verse number="10">(The servants of Hiram and of Solomon who brought gold from Ophir also brought algum wood and precious stones.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The king made the algum wood into steps for the house of the LORD and for the king’s palace, and into lyres and harps for the singers. Never before had anything like them been seen in the land of Judah.)</verse>
  <verse number="12">King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba all she desired—whatever she asked—far more than she had brought the king. Then she left and returned to her own country, along with her servants.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The weight of gold that came to Solomon each year was 666 talents,</verse>
  <verse number="14">not including the revenue from the merchants and traders. And all the Arabian kings and governors of the land also brought gold and silver to Solomon.</verse>
  <verse number="15">King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; six hundred shekels of hammered gold went into each shield.</verse>
  <verse number="16">He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold; three hundred shekels of gold went into each shield. And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Additionally, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The throne had six steps, and a footstool of gold was attached to it. There were armrests on both sides of the seat, with a lion standing beside each armrest.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step. Nothing like this had ever been made for any kingdom.</verse>
  <verse number="20">All King Solomon’s drinking cups were gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There was no silver, because it was accounted as nothing in the days of Solomon.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For the king had the ships of Tarshish that went with Hiram’s servants, and once every three years the ships of Tarshish would arrive bearing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.</verse>
  <verse number="22">So King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="23">All the kings of the earth sought an audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom that God had put in his heart.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Year after year, each visitor would bring his tribute: articles of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots, and 12,000 horses, which he stationed in the chariot cities and also with him in Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="26">He reigned over all the kings from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="27">The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar as abundant as sycamore in the foothills.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and from all the lands.</verse>
  <verse number="29">As for the rest of the acts of Solomon, from beginning to end, are they not written in the Records of Nathan the Prophet, in the Prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the Visions of Iddo the Seer concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat?</verse>
  <verse number="30">Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And Solomon rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David. And his son Rehoboam reigned in his place.</verse>
