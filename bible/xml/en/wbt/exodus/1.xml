<chapter book="Exodus" number="1" translation="Webster Bible Translation" translationID="wbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</verse>
  <verse number="3">Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And all the souls that descended from Jacob, were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and became exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Come, let us deal wisely with them: lest they multiply, and it shall come to pass, that when there falleth out any war, they will join with our enemies, and fight against us, and depart from the land.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Therefore they set over them task-masters, to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure-cities, Pithom, and Raamses.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service in which they made them serve, was with rigor.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives (of which the name of one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:)</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it shall be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it shall be a daughter, then she shall live.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male-children alive.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the male-children alive?</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women: for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in to them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and became very mighty.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</verse>
