  <verse number="1">And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the barbarous people showed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffers not to live.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</verse>
  <verse number="6">However, they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</verse>
  <verse number="7">In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Who also honored us with many honors; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And from there we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</verse>
  <verse number="14">Where we found brothers, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And from there, when the brothers heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said to them, Men and brothers, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they said to him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning you, neither any of the brothers that came showed or spoke any harm of you.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But we desire to hear of you what you think: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spoke the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet to our fathers,</verse>
  <verse number="26">Saying, Go to this people, and say, Hearing you shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing you shall see, and not perceive:</verse>
  <verse number="27">For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And Paul dwelled two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in to him,</verse>
  <verse number="31">Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</verse>
