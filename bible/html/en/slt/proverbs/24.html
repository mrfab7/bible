<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Thou shalt not envy against men of evil, thou shalt not desire to be with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For their heart will meditate destruction, and their lips will speak labor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">By wisdom a house will be built, and it will be prepared by understanding:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A wise man is in strength, and a man of knowledge strengthens power.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For by guidance thou shalt make to thee war, and in the multitude of counselors salvation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">High things to the foolish is wisdom: in the gate he will not open his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He purposing to do evil for himself shall be called the master of mischief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The purpose of folly is sin, and he mocking, an abomination to man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Wilt thou be discouraged in the day of straits thy strength is narrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If thou shalt refrain to deliver those being brought to death, and those going to be slain;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If thou shalt say, Behold, we knew not this; will not he trying hearts, understand? and he guarding thy soul, knew? and he turned back to man according to his work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">My son, eat honey, for it is good; and the dropping of honey being sweet to thy palate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">So the knowledge of wisdom to thy soul if thou shalt find: and there is a latter state and thine expectation shall not be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thou shalt not lay wait, O wicked one, against the dwelling of the just one; thou shalt not destroy his resting place:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For the just one shall fall seven times, and rise: and the unjust shall be weak in evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">In the falling of thine enemies thou shalt not rejoice, and in his stumbling thy heart shall not exult:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Lest Jehovah shall see and it be evil in his eyes, and he turn back from him his anger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thou shalt not be angry against the evil; thou shalt not envy against the unjust:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For there shall be no latter state to the evil one: the light of the unjust shall be extinguished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">My son, fear thou Jehovah and the king: thou shalt not intermingle with those changing:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For suddenly shall their calamity rise, and who shall make known the misfortune of them two?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Also these to the wise. To look upon the face in judgment is not good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He saying to the unjust, Thou art just; peoples shall curse him, and nations shall curse him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And it shall be pleasant to those reproving, and a blessing of good shall come upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He shall kiss the lips turning back right words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Prepare thy work without, and make it ready for thee in the field afterwards; and build thy house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Thou shalt not be a witness gratuitously against thy neighbor, and deceive not with thy lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Thou shalt not say, According to what he did to me, thus will I do to him: I will turn back to the man according to his work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">I passed upon the field of the slothful man, and upon the vineyard of the man wanting heart;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And behold, it came up all of it with thorns; brambles covered its face, and the wall of its stones was overthrown.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And I shall see and set my heart: I looked, I took instruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to lie down:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And thy poverty came going about, and thy want as a man of shield.</p>
