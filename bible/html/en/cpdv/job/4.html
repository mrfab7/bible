<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But Eliphaz the Themanite, answering, said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">If we start to speak to you, perhaps you will take it badly, but who can hold back the words he has conceived?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Behold, you have taught many, and you have strengthened weary hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Your words have reassured the wavering, and you have fortified the trembling knees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But now the scourge has overcome you, and you falter. It has touched you, and you are disturbed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Where is your reverence, your fortitude, your patience, and the perfection of your ways?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Consider this, I beg you: who ever perished being innocent? Or when have the righteous been destroyed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">In fact, I have instead seen those who work iniquity and who sow resentments, reap them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">perishing by the breath of God, and being consumed by the wrath of his spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the lioness, and the teeth of young lions have been worn away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The tiger has perished because it does not have prey, and the young lions have been scattered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Furthermore, a word was spoken to me in secret, and, as if by theft, my ears received the pulse of its whisper.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">In the horror of a vision by night, when men are accustomed to be overtaken by a deep sleep,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">fear and trembling seized me and all my bones were terrified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And when a spirit passed before me, the hair on my body stood up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">There appeared an image before my eyes, someone whose face I did not recognize, and I heard a voice like a gentle breeze.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Should man be justified in relation to God, or will a man be more pure than his Maker?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Behold, those who serve him are not steadfast, and in his angels he finds imperfection.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">How much more will those who live in houses of clay, which have an earthly foundation, be consumed like the moth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">From morning all the way to evening, they will be cut down, and because no one understands, they will be destroyed without ceasing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But those who are left behind will be taken away from them; they will die, and not in wisdom.</p>
