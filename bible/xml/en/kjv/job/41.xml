  <verse number="1">Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord [which] thou lettest down?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft [words] unto thee?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Wilt thou play with him as [with] a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not [one] be cast down even at the sight of him?</verse>
  <verse number="10">None [is so] fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Who hath prevented me, that I should repay [him? whatsoever is] under the whole heaven is mine.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who can discover the face of his garment? [or] who can come [to him] with his double bridle?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth [are] terrible round about.</verse>
  <verse number="15">[His] scales [are his] pride, shut up together [as with] a close seal.</verse>
  <verse number="16">One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.</verse>
  <verse number="18">By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes [are] like the eyelids of the morning.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Out of his mouth go burning lamps, [and] sparks of fire leap out.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as [out] of a seething pot or caldron.</verse>
  <verse number="21">His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="22">In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.</verse>
  <verse number="24">His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether [millstone].</verse>
  <verse number="25">When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="26">The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.</verse>
  <verse number="27">He esteemeth iron as straw, [and] brass as rotten wood.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Sharp stones [are] under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.</verse>
  <verse number="31">He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.</verse>
  <verse number="32">He maketh a path to shine after him; [one] would think the deep [to be] hoary.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</verse>
  <verse number="34">He beholdeth all high [things]: he [is] a king over all the children of pride.</verse>
