<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Send the lamb of the ruler of the land from the rock to the wilderness,—unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it shall be [that] as a wandering bird, [as] a scattered nest, so shall the daughters of Moab be at the fords of the Arnon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Bring in counsel, execute justice; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of noonday; hide the outcasts, discover not the fugitive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the face of the waster. For the extortioner is at an end, the wasting hath ceased, the oppressors are consumed out of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And a throne shall be established in mercy: and in the tent of David there shall sit upon it, in truth, one judging and seeking justice and hastening righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">We have heard of the arrogance of Moab,—[he is] very proud,—of his pride, and his arrogance, and his wrath: his pratings are vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab; every one of them shall howl. For the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn, verily afflicted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For the fields of Heshbon languish, the vine of Sibmah; the lords of the nations have broken down its choice plants: they reached unto Jaazer, they wandered [through] the wilderness; its shoots stretched out, they went beyond the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jaazer for the vine of Sibmah; with my tears will I water thee, Heshbon, and Elealeh, for a cry is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy harvest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And joy and gladness is taken away out of the fruitful field; and in the vineyards there is no singing, neither is there shouting: the treaders tread out no wine in the presses, I have made the cry [of the winepress] to cease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Therefore my bowels sound like a harp for Moab, and mine inward parts for Kirheres.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And it shall come to pass, when Moab shall appear, shall weary himself on the high place, and enter into his sanctuary to pray, that he shall not prevail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">This is the word which Jehovah hath spoken from of old concerning Moab.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And now Jehovah speaketh saying, Within three years, as the years of a hired servant, and the glory of Moab shall be brought to nothing, with all that great multitude; and the remnant shall be small, few, of no account.</p>
