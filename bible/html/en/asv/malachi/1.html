<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The burden of the word of Jehovah to Israel by Malachi.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I have loved you, saith Jehovah. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacobâ€™s brother, saith Jehovah: yet I loved Jacob;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">but Esau I hated, and made his mountains a desolation, and gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Whereas Edom saith, We are beaten down, but we will return and build the waste places; thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and men shall call them The border of wickedness, and The people against whom Jehovah hath indignation for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, Jehovah be magnified beyond the border of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">A son honoreth his father, and a servant his master: if then I am a father, where is mine honor? and if I am a master, where is my fear? saith Jehovah of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar. And ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of Jehovah is contemptible.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And when ye offer the blind for sacrifice, it is no evil! and when ye offer the lame and sick, it is no evil! Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee? or will he accept thy person? saith Jehovah of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And now, I pray you, entreat the favor of God, that he may be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he accept any of your persons? saith Jehovah of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Oh that there were one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle fire on mine altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, saith Jehovah of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the Gentiles, saith Jehovah of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But ye profane it, in that ye say, The table of Jehovah is polluted, and the fruit thereof, even its food, is contemptible.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Ye say also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith Jehovah of hosts; and ye have brought that which was taken by violence, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye bring the offering: should I accept this at your hand? saith Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But cursed be the deceiver, who hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a blemished thing; for I am a great King, saith Jehovah of hosts, and my name is terrible among the Gentiles.</p>
