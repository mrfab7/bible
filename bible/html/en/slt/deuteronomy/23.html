<p class="verse" data-verse="1">He wounded by crushing, and having the privy member cut off, shall not come in to the gathering of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The corrupted shall not come in to the gathering of Jehovah; also the tenth generation to him shall not come into the gathering of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not come into the gathering of Jehovah; also the tenth generation to them shall not come in to the gathering of Jehovah, even forever:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For the word that they met you not with bread and with water in the way in your coming out of Egypt, and who hired against thee Balaam, son of Beor of Pethor, of Arum of the two rivers, to curse thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Jehovah thy God willed not to hear to Balaam: and Jehovah thy God will turn to thee the curse to a blessing, for Jehovah thy God loved thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thou shalt not seek their peace and their good all thy days to forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, for he is thy brother: thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian for thou wert a stranger in his land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The sons which shall be begotten to them, the third generation to them shall come in to the gathering of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">When the camp shall go forth against thine enemies, and watch thyself from every evil word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If there shall be in thee a man that shall not be clean from chance of the night, and he shall go forth without the camp; he shall not come in to the midst of the camp:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And it was turning to evening, he shall wash in water: and as the sun went down he shall come into the midst of the camp.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And a hand shall be to thee from without the camp, and thou shalt go forth there without:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And a peg shall be to thee upon thy utensil: and it was in thy sitting down without, and digging with it, and turn thou back and cover thy excrement:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For Jehovah thy God goes in the midst of thy camp to deliver thee, and to give thine enemies before thy face; and thy camp was holy; and he will not see in thee the nakedness of a word and turn back from after thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thou shalt not deliver the servant to his lord who shall be delivered to thee from his lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">With thee he shall dwell in the midst of thee in the place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, in the good to him: thou shalt not oppress him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Thou shalt not be a harlot from the daughters of Israel, and a male prostitute from the sons of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot, and the price of a dog to the house of Jehovah thy God, for any vow: for these two are also an abomination to Jehovah thy God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thou shalt not lend upon interest to thy brother; interest of silver, interest of food, interest of any word which shall be lent on interest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">To a foreigner thou shalt lend on interest; and to thy brother thou shalt not lend on interest: so that Jehovah thy God shall bless thee in all the stretching forth of thy hand upon the land which thou goest there to possess it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">When thou shalt vow a vow to Jehovah thy God thou shalt not delay to complete it, for Jehovah thy God requiring, will require it from thee; and it was sin in thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And if thou shalt cease to vow, it shall not be sin in thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">That going out of thy lips, thou shalt watch and do according as thou didst vow to Jehovah thy God; a voluntary gift which thou spakest with thy mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">When thou shalt come into the vineyard of thy friend, and eat there grapes according to thy soul, to thy satisfying; and thou shalt not give into thy vessel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">When thou shalt come into thy friend’s standing grain, pluck off the ears with thine hand, and thou shalt not lift up a sickle upon thy friend’s standing grain.</p>
