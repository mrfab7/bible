<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“How have you helped him who is without power! How have you saved the arm that has no strength!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">How have you counseled him who has no wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To whom have you uttered words? Whose spirit came forth from you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">“Those who are deceased tremble, those beneath the waters and all that live in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He stretches out the north over empty space, and hangs the earth on nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not burst under them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He encloses the face of his throne, and spreads his cloud on it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He has described a boundary on the surface of the waters, and to the confines of light and darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his rebuke.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He stirs up the sea with his power, and by his understanding he strikes through Rahab.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">By his Spirit the heavens are garnished. His hand has pierced the swift serpent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways. How small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?”</p>
