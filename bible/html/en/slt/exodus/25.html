<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Speak to the sons of Israel, and they shall take for me an offering: from every man whose heart shall impel him, ye shall take my offerings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And this the offering which ye shall take from them; gold, and silver, and brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Cerulean purple, and reddish purple, and double scarlet and fine cotton, and goatsâ€™ hair,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And skins of rams made red, and tahash skins, and acacia wood;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Oil for a light, spices for the oil of the anointing, and for the incense of aromatics;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And stones of onyx, and stones filling up for the ephod and the breastplate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And make ye to me a holy place; and I will abide in the midst of you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">According to all which I having shewn to thee, the pattern of the tent and the pattern of all its vessels; and thus shall ye do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And make ye an ark of acacia wood: two cubits and a half its length, a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And thou shalt spread pure gold over it, from within and from without thou shalt spread over it; and make to it a wreath of gold round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And thou shalt cast to at four rings of gold, and give upon its four steps: and two rings upon its one side, and two rings upon its second side.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And make bars of acacia wood, and spread over them gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And bring the bars into the rings upon the sides of the ark, to lift up the ark with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The bars shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not remove from them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And give to the ark the testimony which I shall give to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And make a cover of pure gold: two cubits and a half its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And make two cherubs of gold; of turned work shalt thou make them, from the two ends of the cover.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And make the one cherub from this end, and one cherub from this end: thus of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubs upon its two ends.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the cherubs shall be spreading their wings on high, covering with their wings over the cover; and their faces each to the other; to the cover shall be the faces of the cherubs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And give the cover upon the ark from on high; and to the ark thou shalt give the testimony which I shall give to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And I was known to thee there, and I spake to thee from above the cover, from between the two cherubs which are upon the ark of the testimony, all which I shall command thee to the sons of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And make a table of acacia wood; two cubits its length, and a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And spread over it pure gold, and make to it a wreath of gold round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And thou shalt make to it a closing a hand breadth round about, and make a wreath of gold to its closing round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And make to it four gold rings, and give the rings upon the four parts which are to its four feet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And over against the closings shall be the rings for houses for the bars to lift up the table.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And make the bars of acacia wood, and spread over them gold, and lift up with them the table.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And make its dishes, and its censers, and its bowls, and its bowls for libation which to pour into them, pure gold shalt thou make them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Give upon the table the bread of the face before me continually.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And make a candlestick pure gold: turned work shalt thou make the candlestick: its thigh, its shaft, its cups, its chaplets, and flowers, shall be from it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And six stems coming out from its sides; three branches of the chandelier from the one side, and three stems of the chandelier from the second side.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Three bowls made like almonds, in one stem a chaplet and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in the one stem, a chaplet and a flower: thus to the six stems going forth from the chandelier.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And in the chandelier, four bowls made like almonds, its chaplets and its flowers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And a chaplet under two stems from it, and a chaplet under two stems from it, and a chaplet under two stems from it, to the six stems coming out of the chandelier.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Their chaplets and their stems shall be from it: all of it one turned work of pure gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And make its seven lights: and raise up its lights to give light over against its face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And its tongs and its fire pans, pure gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">A talent of pure gold he shall make it, with all these vessels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And see, and make in their pattern which thou wert seeing in the mountain.</p>
