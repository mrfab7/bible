  <verse number="1">And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Moreover let the children of Israel keep the passover in its appointed season.</verse>
  <verse number="3">In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in its appointed season: according to all the statutes of it, and according to all the ordinances thereof, shall ye keep it.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And they kept the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at even, in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And there were certain men, who were unclean by the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:</verse>
  <verse number="7">and those men said unto him, We are unclean by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer the oblation of the LORD in its appointed season among the children of Israel?</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Moses said unto them, Stay ye; that I may hear what the LORD will command concerning you.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="10">Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your generations shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD:</verse>
  <verse number="11">in the second month on the fourteenth day at even they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs:</verse>
  <verse number="12">they shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break a bone thereof: according to all the statute of the passover they shall keep it.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people: because he offered not the oblation of the LORD in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the statute of the passover, and according to the ordinance thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one statute, both for the stranger, and for him that is born in the land.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony: and at even it was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning.</verse>
  <verse number="16">So it was alway: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel encamped.</verse>
  <verse number="18">At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they remained encamped.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And when the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And sometimes the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of the LORD they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they journeyed: or if it continued by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, abiding thereon, the children of Israel remained encamped, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.</verse>
  <verse number="23">At the commandment of the LORD they encamped, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</verse>
