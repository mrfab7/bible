<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, if thou wilt receive my words, And lay up my commandments with thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">So that thou make thine ear attend unto wisdom, And thy heart incline to discernment;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Yea, if thou call for understanding, And lift up thy voice for discernment;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If thou seek her as silver, And search for her as for hid treasures;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, And find the knowledge of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For the LORD giveth wisdom, Out of His mouth cometh knowledge and discernment;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright, He is a shield to them that walk in integrity;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">That He may guard the paths of justice, And preserve the way of His godly ones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice, And equity, yea, every good path.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For wisdom shall enter into thy heart, And knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Discretion shall watch over thee, Discernment shall guard thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">To deliver thee from the way of evil, From the men that speak froward things;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who leave the paths of uprightness, To walk in the ways of darkness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Who rejoice to do evil, And delight in the frowardness of evil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Who are crooked in their ways, And perverse in their paths;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">To deliver thee from the strange woman, Even from the alien woman that maketh smooth her words;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">That forsaketh the lord of her youth, And forgetteth the covenant of her God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For her house sinketh down unto death, And her paths unto the shades;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">None that go unto her return, Neither do they attain unto the paths of life;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, And keep the paths of the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the upright shall dwell in the land, And the whole-hearted shall remain in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, And the faithless shall be plucked up out of it.</p>
