  <verse number="17">And they asked Baruch, saying, Announce now to us how thou didst write all these words from his mouth?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Baruch will say to them, From his mouth he will read to me all these words, and I will write upon the book with ink.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the chiefs will say to Baruch, Go hide, thou, and Jeremiah; and a man not knowing where ye are.</verse>

  <verse number="21">And the king will send Jehudi to take the roll: and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi will read in the ears of the king and in the ears of all the chiefs standing from about the king.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the king will sit in the winter house in the ninth month, and a furnace burning before him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And it will be as Jehudi read three columns and four, he will rend it with the knife of the scribe, and cast into the fire which was in the furnace, even till all the roll was consumed upon the fire which was upon the furnace.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And they trembled not, and they rent not their garments, the king and all his servants hearing all these words.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And also Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah supplicated to the king not to burn the roll: and he heard to them not.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the king commanded Jerahmeel, son of the king, and Seraiah, son of Azriel, and Shelemiah, son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; and Jehovah will hide them.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah after the king burnt the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="28">Turn back, take to thee another roll, and write upon it all the former words which were upon the first roll which Jehoiakim king of Judah, burnt.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And to Jehoiakim king of Judah thou shalt say, Thus said Jehovah, Thou didst burn this roll, saying, Wherefore didst thou write upon it, saying, Coining, the king of Babel shall come and destroy this land, and cause to cease from it man and cattle?</verse>
  <verse number="30">For this, thus said Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim, king of Judah, He sitting upon the throne of David shall not be to him, and his corpse shall be cast out to the heat in the day, and to the cold in the night.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And I reviewed upon him, and upon his seed, and upon his servants, their iniquity; and I brought upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah all the evil which I spake against them, and they heard not.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And Jeremiah took another roll, and he will give it to Baruch son of Neriah the scribe; and he will write upon it from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoialtim king of Judah burnt in the fire: and he added yet to them many words like them.</verse>
