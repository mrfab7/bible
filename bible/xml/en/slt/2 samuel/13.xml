  <verse number="1">And it will be after this, and to Absalom son of David a fair sister, and her name Tamar; and Amnon, son of David, loved her.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Amnon will be pressed to be sick for sake of Tamar his sister, for she was a virgin; and it will be hard in the eyes of Amnon to do anything to her.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And to Amnon a friend, and his name Jonadab, son of Shimeah, David’s brother: and Jonadab a man exceeding wise.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he will say to him, Wherefore thou so weak, son of the king, in morning by morning? wilt thou not announce to me? and Amnon will say to him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Jonadab will say to him, Lie upon thy bed and be sick, and thy father coming to see thee, and say to him, Now my sister Tamar shall come and give me to eat bread and make the food before mine eyes, so that I shall see and eat from her hand.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Amnon will lie down and be sick: and the king will come to see him, and Amnon will say to the king, Will Tamar my sister come now, and she shall make before mine eyes two cakes, and I will eat from her hand.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And David will send to Tamar, saying, Go now to the house of Amnon thy brother, and make food for him.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Tamar will go to the house of Amnon her brother, and he lay down. And she will take dough and knead, and make cakes before his eyes, and bake the cakes.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And she will take a frying-pan and pour out before him; and he will refuse to eat. And Amnon will say, Bring out every man from me. And they brought forth every man from him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Amnon will say to Tamar, Bring the cakes into the chamber, and I will eat from thine hand And Tamar will take the cakes which she made and bring to Amnon her brother into the chamber.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And she will bring near to him to eat, and he will lay hold upon her and say, Come lie with me, my sister.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And she will say to him, No, my brother, thou shalt not humble me; for so it shall not be done in Israel: thou shalt not do this folly.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And I, whither shall I cause my reproach to go? and thou wilt be as one of the foolish in Israel. And now, speak now, to the king, and he will not withhold me from thee.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he would not hear to her voice; and he will be strong above her, and he will humble her and lie with her.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Amnon will hate her with great hatred, greatly; for great the hatred which he hated her above the love which he loved her. And Amnon will say to her, Arise, go.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And she will say to him, No reasons: this evil great above the other which thou didst with me, to send me away. And he would not hear to her.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he will call his boy serving him, and say, Send away now this from me without, and fasten the door after her.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And upon her a tunic reaching to the soles of the feet; for thus will the king’s daughters, the virgins, be clothed with upper garments. And his attendant will bring her forth without, and he fastened the door after.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Tamar will take ashes upon her head, and she rent the tunic reaching to the feet which was upon her, and she will put her hand upon her head and will go, going and crying.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Absalom her brother will say to her Was Amnon thy brother with thee? and now my sister be silent, he is thy brother; thou shalt not set thy heart to this word. And Tamar will remain, and she was desolate in the house of Absalom her brother.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And king David heard all the words and it will kindle to him greatly.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Absalom spake not with Amnon, from evil and even to good: for Absalom hated Amnon for the word that he humbled Tamar his sister.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And it will be for two years of days, and shearers will be to Absalom in Baal-Hazor, which is with Ephraim: and Absalom will call for all the king’s sons.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Absalom will come to the king and say, Behold now, shearers to thy servant: now will the king go, and his servants, with thy servant?</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the king will say to Absalom, No, my son, not now will we all go, and we will not be heavy upon thee. And he will press upon him, and he would not go, and he will bless him.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And Absalom will say, And shall not Amnon my brother now go with us? And the king will say to him, Wherefore shall he go with thee?</verse>
  <verse number="27">And Absalom will press upon him, and he will send with him Amnon and all the king’s sons.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Absalom will command his boys, saying, See now, when the heart of Amnon is good with wine, and I said to you, Strike Amnon; and kill him; ye shall not be afraid, for I commanded you: be strong and be for sons of strength.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Absalom’s boys will do to Amnon as Absalom commanded. And all the king’s sons will rise up and ride each upon his mule and flee.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And it will be they in the way, and the report came to David saying, Absalom struck all the king’s sons and not one remaining of them.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the king will rise and rend his garments, and will lie down upon the earth; and all his servants standing by with their garments rent.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And Jonadab, son of Shimeah, David’s brother, will answer and say, My lord shall not say, All the boys, the king’s sons, were slain; for Amnon alone died; for by the mouth of Absalom it was set from the day he humbled Tamar his sister.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And now my lord the king shall not set to his heart the word, saying, All the king’s sons died; for only Amnon alone died.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Absalom will flee. And the boy watching will lift up his eyes and see, and behold, much people coming from the way behind him from the side of the mountain.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And Jonadab will say to the king, Behold, the king’s sons came; as thy servant spake, so it was.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And it will be as he finished to speak, and behold, the king’s sons came, and they will lift up their voice and weep: and the king and all his servants wept a very great weeping.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And Absalom fled and went to Talmai, son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And he will mourn for his son all the days.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and he will be there three years.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And David the king was fixed to go forth to Absalom: for he was comforted for Amnon, for he died.</verse>
