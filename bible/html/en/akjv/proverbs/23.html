<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="23" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When you sit to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And put a knife to your throat, if you be a man given to appetite.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Labor not to be rich: cease from your own wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Will you set your eyes on that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Eat you not the bread of him that has an evil eye, neither desire you his dainty meats:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For as he thinks in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, said he to you; but his heart is not with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The morsel which you have eaten shall you vomit up, and lose your sweet words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of your words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Apply your heart to instruction, and your ears to the words of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Withhold not correction from the child: for if you beat him with the rod, he shall not die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">You shall beat him with the rod, and shall deliver his soul from hell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">My son, if your heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Yes, my reins shall rejoice, when your lips speak right things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Let not your heart envy sinners: but be you in the fear of the LORD all the day long.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For surely there is an end; and your expectation shall not be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Hear you, my son, and be wise, and guide your heart in the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Listen to your father that begat you, and despise not your mother when she is old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begets a wise child shall have joy of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Your father and your mother shall be glad, and she that bore you shall rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">She also lies in wait as for a prey, and increases the transgressors among men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Who has woe? who has sorrow? who has contentions? who has babbling? who has wounds without cause? who has redness of eyes?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Look not you on the wine when it is red, when it gives his color in the cup, when it moves itself aright.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">At the last it bites like a serpent, and stings like an adder.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Your eyes shall behold strange women, and your heart shall utter perverse things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Yes, you shall be as he that lies down in the middle of the sea, or as he that lies on the top of a mast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">They have stricken me, shall you say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.</p>
