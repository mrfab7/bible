<chapter book="Ecclesiastes" number="2" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">I said in my heart, Go to now, I will prove you with mirth, therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What does it?</verse>
  <verse number="3">I sought in my heart to give myself to wine, yet acquainting my heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I made me great works; I built me houses; I planted me vineyards:</verse>
  <verse number="5">I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:</verse>
  <verse number="6">I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that brings forth trees:</verse>
  <verse number="7">I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in Jerusalem before me:</verse>
  <verse number="8">I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I got me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.</verse>
  <verse number="9">So I was great, and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And whatever my eyes desired I kept not from them, I withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in all my labor: and this was my portion of all my labor.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then I looked on all the works that my hands had worked, and on the labor that I had labored to do: and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that comes after the king? even that which has been already done.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then I saw that wisdom excels folly, as far as light excels darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The wise man’s eyes are in his head; but the fool walks in darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happens to them all.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then said I in my heart, As it happens to the fool, so it happens even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I said in my heart, that this also is vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And how dies the wise man? as the fool.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Therefore I hated life; because the work that is worked under the sun is grievous to me: for all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Yes, I hated all my labor which I had taken under the sun: because I should leave it to the man that shall be after me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And who knows whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun. This is also vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the labor which I took under the sun.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For there is a man whose labor is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that has not labored therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity and a great evil.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For what has man of all his labor, and of the vexation of his heart, wherein he has labored under the sun?</verse>
  <verse number="23">For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yes, his heart takes not rest in the night. This is also vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="24">There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labor. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?</verse>
  <verse number="26">For God gives to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
