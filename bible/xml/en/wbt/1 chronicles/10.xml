  <verse number="1">Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the battle prevailed against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded by the archers.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then said Saul to his armor-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was greatly afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.</verse>
  <verse number="6">So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armor, and sent into the land of the Philistines around, to carry tidings to their idols, and to the people.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they put his armor in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,</verse>
  <verse number="12">They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</verse>
  <verse number="13">So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar spirit, to inquire of it;</verse>
  <verse number="14">And inquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.</verse>
