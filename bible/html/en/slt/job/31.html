<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I cut out a covenant for mine eyes; and why shall I show myself attentive to a virgin?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And what the portion of God from above? and the inheritance of the Almighty from the heights?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is not destruction to the evil one? and strangeness to those working iniquity?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Will he not see my way, and number all my steps?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If I went with vanity, and my foot will haste upon deceit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He shall weigh me in balances of justice, and God will know mine integrity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If my going will incline from the way, and my heart went after mine eyes, and a blemish did cleave upon my hands:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I will sow and another shall eat; and my offspring shall be rooted up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">If my heart was seduced by woman, and I laid wait at the door of my neighbor;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">My wife shall grind for another, and others shall bow down upon her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For this is crime, and this is iniquity for the judges.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For it is a fire; it will devour even to destruction, and will root out upon all mine increase.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I shall despise the judgment of my servant and my maid in their contending with me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And what shall I do when God shall rise up? And when he shall review, what shall I turn back to him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Did not he making me in the womb, make him? And he will prepare us in one belly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If I shall withhold from the desire of the poor, and cause the eyes of the widow to fail;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And eating my morsel alone, and the orphan ate not from it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">(For from my youth he grew up to me as a father, and I shall guide her from my motherâ€™s womb;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If I shall see one perishing from not being clothed, and no covering to the needy;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">If his loins did not praise me, and he will be warmed from the fleece of my sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">If I lifted up my hand against the orphan when I shall see, my help in the gate:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">My shoulder shall fall from its shoulder-blade, and mine, arm shall be broken from the bone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For the destruction of God is a terror to me, and from his lifting up I shall not prevail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">If I set gold my hope, and said to gold, My trust;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If I shall rejoice because of the Multitude of my riches, and because my hand found much;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">If I shall see the light when it shall shine, and the moon going in splendor;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And my heart will be seduced in secret, and my hand shall kiss to my mouth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Also this an iniquity for the judges: for I lied to God from above.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">If I shall rejoice in the destruction of him hating me, and I exalted when evil found him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And I gave not my palate to sin to ask in cursing his soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">If the men of my tent said not, Who will give from his flesh? We shall not be satisfied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">The stranger shall not lodge without: I shall open my doors to the traveler.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If I covered my transgression, as man, to hide mine iniquity in my bosom:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">If I, shall fear a great multitude, and the contempt of families terrify me, and I will be silent and not go out of my door.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Who will give to me hearing to me? Behold, my sign, the Almighty will answer me, and the man contending with me wrote a book.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">If not, I shall lift it up upon my shoulder, I will bind it a crown to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">The number of my steps I shall announce to him: as a leader I shall draw near to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">If my land shall cry against me, and its, furrows shall weep together;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">If I ate its strength without silver, and caused its possessors to expire:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">The thorn shall come forth, instead of wheat, and the weed instead of barley. The words of Job were completed.</p>
