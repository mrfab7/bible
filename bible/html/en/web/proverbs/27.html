<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Don’t boast about tomorrow; for you don’t know what a day may bring forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A stone is heavy, and sand is a burden; but a fool’s provocation is heavier than both.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Wrath is cruel, and anger is overwhelming; but who is able to stand before jealousy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Better is open rebuke than hidden love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Faithful are the wounds of a friend; although the kisses of an enemy are profuse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">A full soul loathes a honeycomb; but to a hungry soul, every bitter thing is sweet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">As a bird that wanders from her nest, so is a man who wanders from his home.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Perfume and incense bring joy to the heart; so does earnest counsel from a man’s friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Don’t forsake your friend and your father’s friend. Don’t go to your brother’s house in the day of your disaster: better is a neighbor who is near than a distant brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Be wise, my son, and bring joy to my heart, then I can answer my tormentor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A prudent man sees danger and takes refuge; but the simple pass on, and suffer for it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Take his garment when he puts up collateral for a stranger. Hold it for a wayward woman!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He who blesses his neighbor with a loud voice early in the morning, it will be taken as a curse by him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">A continual dropping on a rainy day and a contentious wife are alike:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">restraining her is like restraining the wind, or like grasping oil in his right hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Iron sharpens iron; so a man sharpens his friend’s countenance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Whoever tends the fig tree shall eat its fruit. He who looks after his master shall be honored.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">As water reflects a face, so a man’s heart reflects the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied; and a man’s eyes are never satisfied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The crucible is for silver, and the furnace for gold; but man is refined by his praise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Though you grind a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with grain, yet his foolishness will not be removed from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Know well the state of your flocks, and pay attention to your herds:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">for riches are not forever, nor does even the crown endure to all generations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The hay is removed, and the new growth appears, the grasses of the hills are gathered in.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The lambs are for your clothing, and the goats are the price of a field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">There will be plenty of goats’ milk for your food, for your family’s food, and for the nourishment of your servant girls.</p>
