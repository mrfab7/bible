<chapter book="Ephesians" number="4" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Therefore I, the imprisoned in the Lord, beseech you to walk Worthy of the calling which ye were called,</verse>
  <verse number="2">With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, bearing one another in love;</verse>
  <verse number="3">Striving earnestly to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</verse>
  <verse number="4">One body, and one Spirit, as also ye were called in one hope of your calling;</verse>
  <verse number="5">One Lord, one faith, one immersion,</verse>
  <verse number="6">One God and Father of all, who over all, and through all, and in you all.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And to each one of us was grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Wherefore he says, Having ascended into height, he made captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.</verse>
  <verse number="9">(And so having ascended, what is it except that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="10">He having descended is the same having ascended above all the heavens, that he might fill up all things.)</verse>
  <verse number="11">And truly he gave the sent; and the prophets; and the bearers of good tidings; and the shepherds, and the teachers;</verse>
  <verse number="12">For the adjusting of the holy, for the work of the service, for the building up of the body of Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="13">Until we all arrive to the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to the perfect man, to the measure of age of the filling up of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="14">That we be no more babes, tossed about, and carried around by every wind of doctrine, in the playing at dice of men, in craft, with the artifice of deceit;</verse>
  <verse number="15">And speaking the truth in love, let us grow up into him in all things, who is the head, Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="16">From whom all the body fitted together and joined together by every touch of the expenditure, according to the energy in measure of one of each part, makes the increase of the body to the building up of itself in love.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Therefore this I say, and testify in the Lord, that ye no more walk as also the rest of the nations, in the vanity of their mind,</verse>
  <verse number="18">Being darkened in understanding, alienated from the life of God by ignorance being in them, by the hardness of their heart;</verse>
  <verse number="19">Who no longer having had feeling delivered themselves to licentiousness, to the work of all uncleanness in overreaching.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And ye have not so learned Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="21">If ye heard him, and were taught in him, as is the truth in Jesus:</verse>
  <verse number="22">For you to put away according to the former mode of life the old man, corrupted according to the eager desires of deceit;</verse>
  <verse number="23">And to be renewed in the spirit of your mind;</verse>
  <verse number="24">And to put on the new man, created according to God in justice and sanctity of truth.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Wherefore falsehood ye having put away, speak the truth each with his neighbor: for ye are members one of another.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your fit of anger:</verse>
  <verse number="27">Neither give place to the accuser.</verse>
  <verse number="28">He stealing let him steal no more: and rather let him be wearied from fatigue, working good with the hands, that he have to impart to him having need.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Let not any foul word go out of your mouth, but if any good to the building of necessity, that it might give grace to them hearing.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And grieve ye not the Holy Spirit of God in which ye were sealed to the day of redemption.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Let all harshness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and slander, be put away from you, with all badness:</verse>
  <verse number="32">And be ye kind one to another, having good bowels, favoring each other, as also God in Christ Jesus favored you.</verse>
