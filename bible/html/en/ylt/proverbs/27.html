<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Boast not thyself of to-morrow, For thou knowest not what a day bringeth forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Let another praise thee, and not thine own mouth, A stranger, and not thine own lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A stone is heavy, and the sand is heavy, And the anger of a fool Is heavier than they both.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Fury is fierce, and anger is overflowing, And who standeth before jealousy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Better is open reproof than hidden love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Faithful are the wounds of a lover, And abundant the kisses of an enemy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">A satiated soul treadeth down a honeycomb, And to a hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">As a bird wandering from her nest, So is a man wandering from his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart, And the sweetness of one’s friend—from counsel of the soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thine own friend, and the friend of thy father, forsake not, And the house of thy brother enter not In a day of thy calamity, Better is a near neighbour than a brother afar off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Be wise, my son, and rejoice my heart. And I return my reproacher a word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The prudent hath seen the evil, he is hidden, The simple have passed on, they are punished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Take his garment, when a stranger hath been surety, And for a strange woman pledge it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Whoso is saluting his friend with a loud voice, In the morning rising early, A light thing it is reckoned to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">A continual dropping in a day of rain, And a woman of contentions are alike,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Whoso is hiding her hath hidden the wind, And the ointment of his right hand calleth out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Iron by iron is sharpened, And a man sharpens the face of his friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The keeper of a fig-tree eateth its fruit, And the preserver of his master is honoured.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">As in water the face is to face, So the heart of man to man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Sheol and destruction are not satisfied, And the eyes of man are not satisfied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">A refining pot is for silver, and a furnace for gold, And a man according to his praise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">If thou dost beat the foolish in a mortar, Among washed things—with a pestle, His folly turneth not aside from off him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Know well the face of thy flock, Set thy heart to the droves,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For riches are not to the age, Nor a crown to generation and generation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Revealed was the hay, and seen the tender grass, And gathered the herbs of mountains.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Lambs are for thy clothing, And the price of the field are he-goats,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And a sufficiency of goats’ milk is for thy bread, For bread to thy house, and life to thy damsels!</p>
