<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Hear ye what the Lord saith: Arise, contend thou in judgment against the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Let the mountains hear the judgment of the Lord, and the strong foundations of the earth: for the Lord will enter into judgment with his people, and he will plead against Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">O my people, what have I done to thee, or in what have I molested thee? answer thou me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and delivered thee out of the house of slaves: and I sent before thy face Moses, and Aaron, and Mary.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">O my people, remember, I pray thee, what Balach the king of Moab purposed: and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, from Setim to Galgal, that thou mightest know the justices of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">What shall I offer to the Lord that is worthy? wherewith shall I kneel before the high God? shall I offer holocausts unto him, and calves of a year old?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">May the Lord be appeased with thousands of rams, or with many thousands of fat he goats? shall I give my firstborn for my wickedness, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I will shew thee, O man, what is good, and what the Lord requireth of thee: Verily, to do judgment, and to love mercy, and to walk solicitous with thy God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The voice of the Lord crieth to the city, and salvation shall be to them that fear thy name: hear, O ye tribes, and who shall approve it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">As yet there is a fire in the house of the wicked, the treasures of iniquity, and a scant measure full of wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Shall I justify wicked balances, and the deceitful weights of the bag?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">By which her rich men were filled with iniquity, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue was deceitful in their mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And I therefore began to strike thee with desolation for thy sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thou shalt eat, but shalt not be filled: and thy humiliation shall be in the midst of thee: and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not save: and those whom thou shalt save, I will give up to the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap: thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt not be anointed with the oil: and the new wine, but shalt not drink the wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For thou hast kept the statutes of Amri, and all the works of the house of Achab: and thou hast walked according to their wills, that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof a hissing, and you shall bear the reproach of my people.</p>
