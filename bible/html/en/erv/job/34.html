<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="34" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover Elihu answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear my words, ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the ear trieth words, as the palate tasteth meat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Let us choose for us that which is right: let us know among ourselves what is good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For Job hath said, I am righteous, and God hath taken away my right:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Notwithstanding my right I am accounted a liar; my wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For he hath said, it profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who gave him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Shall even one that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is just and mighty?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art vile? or to nobles, Ye are wicked?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">How much less to him that respecteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In a moment they die, even at midnight; the people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are taken away without hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For his eyes are upon the ways of a man, and he seeth all his goings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For he needeth not further to consider a man, that he should go before God in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He breaketh in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out, and setteth others in their stead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Therefore he taketh knowledge of their works; and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Because they turned aside from following him, and would not have regard to any of his ways:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">So that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heard the cry of the afflicted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">When he giveth quietness, who then can condemn? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done unto a nation, or unto a man, alike:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">That the godless man reign not, that there be none to ensnare the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For hath any said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Shall his recompence be as thou wilt, that thou refusest it? for thou must choose, and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Men of understanding will say unto me, yea, every wise man that heareth me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Job speaketh without knowledge, and his words are without wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Would that Job were tried unto the end, because of his answering like wicked men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</p>
