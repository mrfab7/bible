<chapter book="2 Timothy" number="1" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="2">To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and day;</verse>
  <verse number="4">Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;</verse>
  <verse number="5">When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in you, which dwelled first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in you also.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Why I put you in remembrance that you stir up the gift of God, which is in you by the putting on of my hands.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For God has not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Be not you therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be you partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;</verse>
  <verse number="9">Who has saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,</verse>
  <verse number="10">But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death, and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:</verse>
  <verse number="11">Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Hold fast the form of sound words, which you have heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="14">That good thing which was committed to you keep by the Holy Ghost which dwells in us.</verse>
  <verse number="15">This you know, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:</verse>
  <verse number="17">But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The Lord grant to him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered to me at Ephesus, you know very well.</verse>
