<chapter book="Hebrews" number="9" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And truly therefore the first had precepts of divine service for him, and a worldly holy place.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For the first tent was prepared; (in which was the chandelier, and table, and the setting up of the loaves;) which is called holy.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And after the second veil, the tent called Holy of Holies;</verse>
  <verse number="4">Having the golden censer, and ark of the covenant surrounded on all sides with gold, in which was the golden urn having the manna, and Aaron’s rod having budded, and the tables of the covenant;</verse>
  <verse number="5">And above it the cherubs of glory overshadowing the propitiatory; of which it is not now to speak in turn.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And these thus prepared, truly to the first tent the priests always came in, to complete the divine services.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And into the second the chief priest alone once a year, not without blood, which he brings near for himself, and the errors of the people:</verse>
  <verse number="8">This the Holy Spirit designating, the way of the holies had not yet been made manifest, the first tent yet having a standing:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Which a parable for the time placed in, according to which both gifts and sacrifices are brought near, not being able for consciousness to perfect him serving;</verse>
  <verse number="10">Only in food and drinks, and different immersions, and precepts of the flesh, being placed till the time of amendment.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Christ being present, a chief priest of good things about to be, by a greater and more perfect tent, not made with hands, that is; not of this creation;</verse>
  <verse number="12">Neither by the blood of he-goats and calves, and by his own blood he went in once for all to the holies, having found eternal deliverance.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For if the blood of bulls and he-goats, and the ashes of a heifer besprinkling the polluted, consecrates to the purity of the flesh:</verse>
  <verse number="14">How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself blameless to God, purify your consciousness from dead works to serve the living God?</verse>
  <verse number="15">And for this he is mediator of a new covenant, that death having been, for redemption of the transgressions for the first covenant, the called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For where a will, the necessity for the death of him having willed to be brought forward.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For a will is firm by the dead: since it has no power when he having willed lives.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Wherefore neither was the first consecrated without blood.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For every command spoken according to law by Moses, to all the people, having taken the blood of calves and he-goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and also the book, and he sprinkled all the people,</verse>
  <verse number="20">Saying, This the blood of the covenant which God enjoined to you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And also the tent, and all the vessels of the service, he poured all over likewise with blood.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And almost all things are purified according to the law with blood; and without blood-letting there is no remission.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Therefore truly a necessity for the patterns of things in the heavens to be purified with these; and the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For Christ came not into the holy places made with hands, the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to be shown clearly to the face of God for us:</verse>
  <verse number="25">Neither that he should offer himself many times, as the chief priest comes in to the holy places yearly with blood pertaining to others;</verse>
  <verse number="26">(Since he must have suffered many times from the foundation of the world:) but now once at the termination of the times for the annulling of sin by the sacrifice of himself has he been shown clearly.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And inasmuch as it is reserved to men once to die, and after this the judgment:</verse>
  <verse number="28">So Christ, once offered to have borne the sins of many, of the second time, without sin, shall be seen to them expecting him for salvation.</verse>
