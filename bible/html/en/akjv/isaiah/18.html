<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="18" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">That sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes on the waters, saying, Go, you swift messengers, to a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their beginning till now; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">All you inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth, see you, when he lifts up an ensign on the mountains; and when he blows a trumpet, hear you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For so the LORD said to me, I will take my rest, and I will consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat on herbs, and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For before the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the branches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">They shall be left together to the fowls of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer on them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter on them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In that time shall the present be brought to the LORD of hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people terrible from their beginning till now; a nation meted out and trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.</p>
