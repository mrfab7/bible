<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Having put aside, then, all evil, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envyings, and all evil speakings,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">as new-born babes the word’s pure milk desire ye, that in it ye may grow,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">if so be ye did taste that the Lord is gracious,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">to whom coming—a living stone—by men, indeed, having been disapproved of, but with God choice, precious,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and ye yourselves, as living stones, are built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Wherefore, also, it is contained in the Writing: ‘Lo, I lay in Zion a chief corner-stone, choice, precious, and he who is believing on him may not be put to shame;’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">to you, then, who are believing is the preciousness; and to the unbelieving, a stone that the builders disapproved of, this one did become for the head of a corner,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence—who are stumbling at the word, being unbelieving,—to which also they were set;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and ye are a choice race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired, that the excellences ye may shew forth of Him who out of darkness did call you to His wondrous light;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">who were once not a people, and are now the people of God; who had not found kindness, and now have found kindness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Beloved, I call upon you, as strangers and sojourners, to keep from the fleshly desires, that war against the soul,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">having your behaviour among the nations right, that in that which they speak against you as evil-doers, of the good works having beheld, they may glorify God in a day of inspection.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Be subject, then, to every human creation, because of the Lord, whether to a king, as the highest,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">whether to governors, as to those sent through him, for punishment, indeed, of evil-doers, and a praise of those doing good;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">because, so is the will of God, doing good, to put to silence the ignorance of the foolish men;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">as free, and not having the freedom as the cloak of the evil, but as servants of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">to all give ye honour; the brotherhood love ye; God fear ye; the king honour ye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The domestics! be subjecting yourselves in all fear to the masters, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the cross;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">for this is gracious, if because of conscience toward God any one doth endure sorrows, suffering unrighteously;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">for what renown is it, if sinning and being buffeted, ye do endure it? but if, doing good and suffering for it, ye do endure, this is gracious with God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">for to this ye were called, because Christ also did suffer for you, leaving to you an example, that ye may follow his steps,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">who did not commit sin, nor was guile found in his mouth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">who being reviled—was not reviling again, suffering—was not threatening, and was committing himself to Him who is judging righteously,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">who our sins himself did bear in his body, upon the tree, that to the sins having died, to the righteousness we may live; by whose stripes ye were healed,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">for ye were as sheep going astray, but ye turned back now to the shepherd and overseer of your souls.</p>
