<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they commanded the people, saying, When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then you shall remove from your place, and go after it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near to it, that you may know the way by which you must go: for you have not passed this way heretofore.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the LORD said to Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And you shall command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When you are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, you shall stand still in Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come here, and hear the words of the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Joshua said, Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth passes over before you into Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand on an heap.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And as they that bore the ark were come to Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overflows all his banks all the time of harvest,)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up on an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the middle of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.</p>
