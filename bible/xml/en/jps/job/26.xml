  <verse number="1">Then Job answered and said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">How hast thou helped him that is without power! How hast thou saved the arm that hath no strength!</verse>
  <verse number="3">How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom, And plentifully declared sound knowledge!</verse>
  <verse number="4">With whose help hast thou uttered words? And whose spirit came forth from thee?</verse>
  <verse number="5">The shades tremble Beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The nether-world is naked before Him, And Destruction hath no covering.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He stretcheth out the north over the empty space, And hangeth the earth over nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He bindeth up the waters in His thick clouds; And the cloud is not rent under them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He closeth in the face of His throne, And spreadeth His cloud upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters, Unto the confines of light and darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The pillars of heaven tremble And are astonished at His rebuke.</verse>
  <verse number="12">He stirreth up the sea with His power, And by His understanding He smiteth through Rahab.</verse>
  <verse number="13">By His breath the heavens are serene; His hand hath pierced the slant serpent.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Lo, these are but the outskirts of His ways; And how small a whisper is heard of Him! But the thunder of His mighty deeds who can understand?</verse>
