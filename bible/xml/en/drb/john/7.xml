  <verse number="1">AFTER these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And his brethren said to him: Pass from hence, and go into Judea; that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou dost.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For there is no man that doth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, manifest thyself to the world.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For neither did his brethren believe in him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then Jesus said to them: My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth: because I give testimony of it, that the works thereof are evil.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Go you up to this festival day, but I go not up to this festival day: because my time is not accomplished.</verse>
  <verse number="9">When he had said these things, he himself stayed in Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But after his brethren were gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but, as it were, in secret.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The Jews therefore sought him on the festival day, and said: Where is he?</verse>
  <verse number="12">And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him. For some said: He is a good man. And others said: No, but he seduceth the people.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Yet no man spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the Jews wondered, saying: How doth this man know letters, having never learned?</verse>
  <verse number="16">Jesus answered them, and said: My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">If any man do the will of him; he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He that speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, he is true, and there is no injustice in him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Did Moses not give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Why seek you to kill me? The multitude answered, and said: Thou hast a devil; who seeketh to kill thee?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Jesus answered, and said to them: One work I have done; and you all wonder:</verse>
  <verse number="22">Therefore, Moses gave you circumcision (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and on the sabbath day you circumcise a man.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath day, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are you angry at me because I have healed the whole man on the sabbath day?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Judge not according to the appearance, but judge just judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Some therefore of Jerusalem said: Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</verse>
  <verse number="26">And behold, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing to him. Have the rulers known for a truth, that this is the Christ?</verse>
  <verse number="27">But we know this man, whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching, and saying: You both know me, and you know whence I am: and I am not come of myself; but he that sent me, is true, whom you know not.</verse>
  <verse number="29">I know him, because I am from him, and he hath sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="30">They sought therefore to apprehend him: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</verse>
  <verse number="31">But of the people many believed in him, and said: When the Christ cometh, shall he do more miracles, than these which this man doth?</verse>
  <verse number="32">The Pharisees heard the people murmuring these things concerning him: and the rulers and Pharisees sent ministers to apprehend him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while I am with you: and then I go to him that sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="34">You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come.</verse>
  <verse number="35">The Jews therefore said among themselves: Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</verse>
  <verse number="36">What is this saying that he hath said: You shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, you cannot come?</verse>
  <verse number="37">And on the last, and great day of the festivity, Jesus stood and cried, saying: If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.</verse>
  <verse number="38">He that believeth in me, as the scripture saith, Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</verse>
  <verse number="39">Now this he said of the Spirit which they should receive, who believed in him: for as yet the Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</verse>
  <verse number="40">Of that multitude therefore, when they had heard these words of his, some said: This is the prophet indeed.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Others said: This is the Christ. But some said: Doth the Christ come out of Galilee?</verse>
  <verse number="42">Doth not the scripture say: That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem the town where David was?</verse>
  <verse number="43">So there arose a dissension among the people because of him.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And some of them would have apprehended him: but no man laid hands on him.</verse>
  <verse number="45">The ministers therefore came to the chief priests and the Pharisees. And they said to them: Why have you not brought him?</verse>
  <verse number="46">The ministers answered: Never did man speak like this man.</verse>
  <verse number="47">The Pharisees therefore answered them: Are you also seduced?</verse>
  <verse number="48">Hath any one of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?</verse>
  <verse number="49">But this multitude, that knoweth not the law, are accursed.</verse>
  <verse number="50">Nicodemus said to them, (he that came to him by night, who was one of them:)</verse>
  <verse number="51">Doth our law judge any man, unless it first hear him, and know what he doth?</verse>
  <verse number="52">They answered, and said to him: Art thou also a Galilean? Search the scriptures, and see, that out of Galilee a prophet riseth not.</verse>
  <verse number="53">And every man returned to his own house.</verse>
