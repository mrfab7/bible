<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Behold, a king shall reign for justice, and for chiefs they shall rule for judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And a man was as a hiding of the spirit, and a covering of the tempest; as brooks of water in Zion, as the shadow of a weighty rock in a weary land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the eyes of those seeing shall not be blinded, and the ears of those hearing shall attend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the heart of the hasty shall understand to know, and the tongue of those stammering shall hasten to speak plain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Liberal shall no more be called to the foolish, and noble shall not be said to the deceiver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For the foolish will speak folly, and his heart will do vanity to do profaneness and to speak error to Jehovah, to empty the soul of the hungry; and he will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the implements of the deceiver are evil: he will meditate counsels to destroy the humble with words of falsehood, and in the needyâ€™s speaking judgments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the liberal will counsel liberal things, and upon liberal things shall he stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Rise up, ye careless women; hear my voice, ye confident daughters; give ear to my word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Days over a year shall ye being confident, be disturbed; for the vintage being finished, the ingathering shall not come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Tremble, ye careless be disturbed, ye, confident: strip and be naked, gird upon the loins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Smiting upon the breasts for the fields of desire, for the fruitful vine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Upon the land of my people shall come up the thorn of the sharp point; so upon the houses of rejoicing of the exulting city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For the fortress was left, the multitude of the city was forsaken; the hill and the watch-tower for caves even forever; the rejoicing of the wild asses a pasture of the flocks;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Until the spirit shall be poured upon us from on high, and the desert be for Carmel, and Carmel be reckoned for a forest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And judgment dwelling in the desert, and justice shall sit in Carmel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the work of justice was peace, and the service of justice, rest and confidence, even to forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And my people shall sit in a dwelling of peace, and in habitations of trust and in quiet resting places.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the hail hailing upon the forest; and the city shall be made low in lowness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Happy ye sowing upon all waters, sending the foot of the ox and the ass.</p>
