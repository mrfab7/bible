<p class="verse" data-verse="1">So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram; against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Now Elihu had waited to speak unto Job, because they were older than he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said: I am young, and ye are very old; Wherefore I held back, and durst not declare you mine opinion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I said: ‘Days should speak, And multitude of years should teach wisdom.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But it is a spirit in man, And the breath of the Almighty, that giveth them understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">It is not the great that are wise, Nor the aged that discern judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore I say: ‘Hearken to me; I also will declare mine opinion.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your reasons, Whilst ye searched out what to say.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Yea, I attended unto you, And, behold, there was none that convinced Job, Or that answered his words, among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Beware lest ye say: ‘We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not man!’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For he hath not directed his words against me; Neither will I answer him with your speeches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">They are amazed, they answer no more; Words are departed from them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And shall I wait, because they speak not, Because they stand still, and answer no more?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I also will answer my part, I also will declare mine opinion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For I am full of words; The spirit within me constraineth me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Behold, mine inwards are as wine which hath no vent; Like new wine-skins which are ready to burst.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I will speak, that I may find relief; I will open my lips and answer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Let me not, I pray you, respect any man’s person; Neither will I give flattering titles unto any man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For I know not to give flattering titles; Else would my Maker soon take me away</p>
