  <verse number="1">Just at this time an edict was issued by Caesar Augustus for the registration of the whole Empire.</verse>
  <verse number="2">It was the first registration made during the governorship of Quirinius in Syria;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and all went to be registered—every one to the town to which he belonged.</verse>
  <verse number="4">So Joseph went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judaea, to David’s town of Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David,</verse>
  <verse number="5">to have himself registered together with Mary, who was betrothed to him and was with child.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But while they were there, her full time came,</verse>
  <verse number="7">and she gave birth to her first-born son, and wrapped Him round, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now there were shepherds in the same part of the country, keeping watch over their sheep by night in the open fields,</verse>
  <verse number="9">when suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the glory of the Lord shone round them; and they were filled with terror.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But the angel said to them, “Put away all fear; for I am bringing you good news of great joy—joy for all the People.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For a Saviour who is the Anointed Lord is born to you to-day, in the town of David.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And this is the token for you: you will find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">And immediately there was with the angel a multitude of the army of Heaven praising God and saying,</verse>
  <verse number="14">“Glory be to God in the highest Heavens, And on earth peace among men who please Him!”</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then, as soon as the angels had left them and returned to Heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us now go over as far as Bethlehem and see this that has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.”</verse>
  <verse number="16">So they made haste and came and found Mary and Joseph, with the babe lying in the manger.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And when they saw the child, they told what had been said to them about Him;</verse>
  <verse number="18">and all who listened were astonished at what the shepherds told them.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But Mary treasured up all these things, often dwelling on them in her mind.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen in accordance with the announcement made to them.</verse>
  <verse number="21">When eight days had passed and the time for circumcising Him had come, He was called JESUS, the name given Him by the angel before His conception in the womb.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And when the days for their purification appointed by the Law of Moses had passed, they took Him up to Jerusalem to present Him to the Lord—</verse>
  <verse number="23">as it is written in the Law of the Lord: “Every first-born male shall be called holy to the Lord.”</verse>
  <verse number="24">And they also offered a sacrifice as commanded in the Law of the Lord, “a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">Now there was a man in Jerusalem of the name of Symeon, an upright and God-fearing man, who was waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="26">To him it had been revealed by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death until he had seen the Lord’s Anointed One.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Led by the Spirit he came to the Temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do with regard to Him according to the custom of the Law,</verse>
  <verse number="28">he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said,</verse>
  <verse number="29">“Now, O Sovereign Lord, Thou dost send Thy servant away in peace, in fulfilment of Thy word,</verse>
  <verse number="30">Because mine eyes have seen Thy salvation,</verse>
  <verse number="31">Which Thou hast made ready in the sight of all nations—</verse>
  <verse number="32">A light to shine upon the Gentiles, And the glory of Thy people Israel.”</verse>
  <verse number="33">And while the child’s father and mother were wondering at the words of Symeon concerning Him,</verse>
  <verse number="34">Symeon blessed them and said to Mary the mother, “This child is appointed for the falling and the uprising of many in Israel and for a token to be spoken against;</verse>
  <verse number="35">and a sword will pierce through your own soul also; that the reasonings in many hearts may be revealed.”</verse>
  <verse number="36">There was also Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, belonging to the tribe of Asher. She was of a very great age, having had after her maidenhood seven years of married life,</verse>
  <verse number="37">and then being a widow of eighty-four years. She was never absent from the Temple, but worshipped, by day and by night, with fasting and prayer.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And coming up just at that moment, she gave thanks to God, and spoke about the child to all who were expecting the deliverance of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="39">Then, as soon as they had accomplished all that the Law required, they returned to Galilee to their own town of Nazareth.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And the child grew and became strong and full of wisdom, and the favour of God rested upon Him.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Now His parents used to go up year by year to Jerusalem at the Feast of the Passover.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And when He was twelve years old they went up as was customary at the time of the Feast, and,</verse>
  <verse number="43">after staying the full number of days, when they started back home the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not discover this,</verse>
  <verse number="44">but supposing Him to be in the travelling company, they proceeded a day’s journey. Then they searched up and down for Him among their relatives and acquaintances;</verse>
  <verse number="45">but being unable to find Him they returned to Jerusalem, making anxious inquiry for Him.</verse>
  <verse number="46">On the third day they found Him in the Temple sitting among the Rabbis, both listening to them and asking them questions,</verse>
  <verse number="47">while all who heard Him were astonished at His intelligence and at the answers He gave.</verse>
  <verse number="48">When they saw Him, they were smitten with amazement, and His mother said to Him, “My child, why have you behaved thus to us? Your father and I have been searching for you in anguish.”</verse>
  <verse number="49">“Why is it that you have been searching for me?” He replied; “did you not know that it is my duty to be engaged upon my Father’s business?”</verse>
  <verse number="50">But they did not understand the significance of these words.</verse>
  <verse number="51">Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was always obedient to them; but His mother carefully treasured up all these incidents in her memory.</verse>
  <verse number="52">And as Jesus grew older He gained in both wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man.</verse>
