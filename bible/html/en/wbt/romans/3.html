<p class="verse" data-verse="1">What advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Much every way: chiefly, because that to them were committed the oracles of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For what if some did not believe? will their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">By no means: verily let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mayest be justified in thy sayings, and mayest overcome when thou art judged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But if our unrighteousness commendeth the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">By no means: for then how shall God judge the world?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie to his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And not rather (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Their throat is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Their feet are swift to shed blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Destruction and misery are in their ways:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the way of peace have they not known.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">There is no fear of God before their eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Now we know that whatever things the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Therefore by the deeds of the law, there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being testified by the law and the prophets;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all, and upon all them that believe; for there is no difference:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he may be just, and the justifier of him who believeth in Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No; but by the law of faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Therefore we conclude, that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Seeing it is one God who will justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Do we then make void the law through faith? By no means: but we establish the law.</p>
