<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="6" data-translation="Darby Bible Translation" data-translation-id="dbt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas; therefore my words are vehement.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, their poison drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of +God are arrayed against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Doth the wild ass bray by the grass? loweth an ox over his fodder?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Shall that which is insipid be eaten without salt? Is there any taste in the white of an egg?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">What my soul refuseth to touch, that is as my loathsome food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Oh that I might have my request, and that +God would grant my desire!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And that it would please +God to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then should I yet have comfort; and in the pain which spareth not I would rejoice that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should have patience?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Is my strength the strength of stones? is my flesh of brass?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Is it not that there is no help in me, and soundness is driven away from me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For him that is fainting kindness [is meet] from his friend; or he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a stream, as the channel of streams which pass away,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Which are turbid by reason of the ice, in which the snow hideth itself:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">At the time they diminish, they are dried up; when heat affecteth them, they vanish from their place:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">They wind about in the paths of their course, they go off into the waste and perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The caravans of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba counted on them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">They are ashamed at their hope; they come thither, and are confounded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">So now ye are nothing; ye see a terrible object and are afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Did I say, Bring unto me, and make me a present from your substance?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Or, rescue me from the hand of the oppressor, and redeem me from the hand of the violent?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Teach me, and I will hold my tongue; and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">How forcible are right words! but what doth your upbraiding reprove?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Do ye imagine to reprove words? The speeches of one that is desperate are indeed for the wind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and dig [a pit] for your friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Now therefore if ye will, look upon me; and it shall be to your face if I lie.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Return, I pray you, let there be no wrong; yea, return again, my righteousness shall be in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Is there wrong in my tongue? cannot my taste discern mischievous things?</p>
