<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Brethren, even if a man be overtaken in any trespass, ye which are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of meekness; looking to thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Bear ye one anotherâ€™s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For if a man thinketh himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But let each man prove his own work, and then shall he have his glorying in regard of himself alone, and not of his neighbour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For each man shall bear his own burden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">So then, as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward them that are of the household of the faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">See with how large letters I have written unto you with mine own hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For not even they who receive circumcision do themselves keep the law; but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But far be it from me to glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world hath been crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace be upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.</p>
