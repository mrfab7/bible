<chapter book="Song of Solomon" number="2" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.</verse>
  <verse number="2">As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.</verse>
  <verse number="3">As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.</verse>
  <verse number="6">His left hand is under my head, and his right hand does embrace me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I charge you, O you daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that you stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The voice of my beloved! behold, he comes leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills.</verse>
  <verse number="9">My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he stands behind our wall, he looks forth at the windows, showing himself through the lattice.</verse>
  <verse number="10">My beloved spoke, and said to me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For, see, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;</verse>
  <verse number="12">The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;</verse>
  <verse number="13">The fig tree puts forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</verse>
  <verse number="14">O my dove, that are in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see your countenance, let me hear your voice; for sweet is your voice, and your countenance is comely.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.</verse>
  <verse number="16">My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feeds among the lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be you like a roe or a young hart on the mountains of Bether.</verse>
