<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The word that Jeremiah the prophet hath spoken unto Baruch son of Neriah, in his writing these words on a book from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">‘Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, concerning thee, O Baruch:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">‘Thou hast said, Woe to me, now, for Jehovah hath added sorrow to my pain, I have been wearied with my sighing, and rest I have not found.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thus dost thou say unto him: Thus said Jehovah: Lo, that which I have built I am throwing down, and that which I have planted I am plucking up, even the whole land itself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And thou—thou seekest for thee great things—do not seek, for lo, I am bringing in evil on all flesh—an affirmation of Jehovah—and I have given to thee thy life for a spoil, in all places whither thou goest.’</p>
