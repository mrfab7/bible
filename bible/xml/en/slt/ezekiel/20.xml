  <verse number="1">And it will be in the seventh year, in the fifth, in the tenth to the month, men from the old men of Israel came to seek Jehovah, and they sat before my face.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="3">Son of man, speak to the old men of Israel, and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Come ye to seek me? I live, if I will be sought for you, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Wilt thou judge them, wilt thou judge, son of man? Cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:</verse>
  <verse number="5">And say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In the day of my choosing upon Israel, and I will lift up my hand to the seed of the house of Jacob, and I will be known to them in the land of Egypt, and I will lift up my hand to them, saying, I am Jehovah your God;</verse>
  <verse number="6">In that day I lifted up my hand to them to bring them forth out of the land of Egypt to the land which I spied out for them flowing milk and honey; this the glory to all lands:</verse>
  <verse number="7">And saying to them, Cast ye away each the abominations of his eyes, an ye shall not be defiled with the blocks of Egypt: I am Jehovah your God.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And they will rebel against me, and they would not hear to me: they cast not away each the abominations of their eyes, and they forsook not the blocks of Egypt: and saying, To pour out my wrath upon them, to complete mine anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And I will do for sake of my name, that it was not profaned before the eyes of the nations which they were in the midst of them, which I was made known to them before their eyes to bring them forth from the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And I shall cause, them to go forth from the land of Egypt, and I shall bring them to the desert.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And I shall give to them my laws, and my judgments I caused them to know, which a man shall do them and he lived in them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And also my Sabbaths I gave to them to be for a sign between me and between them, to know that I am Jehovah consecrating them.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the house of Israel will rebel against me fit the desert: in my laws they went not, and my judgments they rejected, which a man shall do them and he lived in them: and my Sabbaths they profaned greatly and saying, To pour out my wrath upon them in the desert to finish them.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And I shall do for sake of my name, that it was not polluted before the eyes of the nations which I brought them forth before their eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And also I lifted up my hand to them in the desert, not to bring them in to the land which I gave flowing milk and honey; this the glory to all lands.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Because they rejected upon my judgments, and my laws they went not in them, and my Sabbaths they profaned: for their heart went after their blocks.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And mine eye will spare for them from destroying them, and I made not a completion with them in the desert.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And saying to their sons in the desert Ye shall not go in the laws of your fathers, and their judgments ye shall not watch, and with their blocks ye shall not be defiled.</verse>
  <verse number="19">I am Jehovah your God; go ye in my: laws, and watch ye my judgments and do them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And consecrate my Sabbaths; and they were for a sign between me and between you to know that I am Jehovah your God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And their sons will rebel against me: they went not in my laws, and my judgments they watched not to do them, which a man shall do them and live in them: my Sabbaths they profaned: and saying, To pour out my wrath upon them to complete mine anger against them in the desert.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And I turned back my hand; and I will do for sake of my name, that it was not profaned before the eyes of the nations which I brought them forth before their eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Also I lifted up my hand to them in the desert, to scatter them in the nations, to disperse them is the lands.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Because they did not my judgments, and my laws they rejected, and my Sabbaths they profaned, and their eyes were after their fathers blocks.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And also I gave to them laws not good, and judgments they shall not live in them.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And I will defile them in their gifts in causing to pass through all bursting open the womb, so that I shall make them desolate, that they shall know that I am Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For this, speak to the house of Israel, son of man, and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Yet in this your fathers reviled me, in their transgressing a transgression against me.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And I shall bring them to the land which I lifted up my hand to give, it to them, and they will see every high hill and every thick tree, and they will sacrifice there their sacrifices, and they will give there the provocation of their oblation, and they will set there the odor of their sweetnesses, and they will pour out there their libations:</verse>
  <verse number="29">And saying to them, What the height where ye go there? And its name will be called Height, even to this day.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For this, say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Are ye defiled in the way of your fathers? and commit ye fornication after their abominations?</verse>
  <verse number="31">And in lifting up your gifts, in causing your sons to pass into the fire ye are defiled for all your blocks, even to this day: and shall I be sought for you, O house of Israel? I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if I will be sought by you.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And the things were coming up upon your spirit which will not be which ye say, We will be as the nations, as the families of the lands to serve wood and stone.</verse>
  <verse number="33">I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if not with a strong hand and with an arm stretched out, and with wrath poured out, will I reign over you.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And I brought you forth from the peoples, and I gathered you from the lands where ye were scattered in them, with a strong hand and with an arm stretched out, and with wrath panted out.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And I brought you into the desert of the peoples, and I judged you there face to face.</verse>
  <verse number="36">As I contended with your fathers in the desert of the land of Egypt, so will I contend with you, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And I caused you to pass under the rod I brought you into the bond of the covenant.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And I separated from you the rebellious and those transgressing against me: I will bring them forth from the land of their sojournings, and to the land of Israel they shall not come in: and ye knew that I am Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And ye, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord Jehovah: Go serve ye each his blocks, and afterward if ye bear not to me and ye shall not profane my holy name yet with your gifts and with your blocks.</verse>
  <verse number="40">For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah, there shall all the house of Israel serve me, all in the land: there I will receive them into favor, and there I will seek your offerings and the chief of your liftings up, with all your holy things.</verse>
  <verse number="41">With the odor of sweetness I will receive you into favor in my bringing you forth from the peoples, and I gathered you from the lands where ye were scattered in them; and I was consecrated in you before the eyes of the nations.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And ye knew that I am Jehovah in my bringing you into the land of Israel, to the land which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And ye remembered there your ways, and all your works which ye were defiled in them; and ye shall be wearied in your faces for all your evils which ye did.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And ye knew that I am Jehovah in my doing with you for sake of my name, not according to your evil ways and your corrupt deeds, O house of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="46">Son of man, set thy face the way of the south, and drop to the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And say to the forest of the south, Hear thou the word of Jehovah; thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me kindling a fire in thee, and it consumed in thee every green tree and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north were burned in it.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And all flesh saw that I Jehovah kindled it: it shall not be quenched.</verse>
  <verse number="49">And saying, Ah, Lord Jehovah, they say to me, Does he not use parables?</verse>
