<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But [as] fellow-workmen, we also beseech that ye receive not the grace of God in vain:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">(for he says, I have listened to thee in an accepted time, and I have helped thee in a day of salvation: behold, now [is the] well-accepted time; behold, now [the] day of salvation:)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">giving no manner of offence in anything, that the ministry be not blamed;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">but in everything commending ourselves as God’s ministers, in much endurance, in afflictions, in necessities, in straits,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">in stripes, in prisons, in riots, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in [the] Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">in [the] word of truth, in [the] power of God; through the arms of righteousness on the right hand and left,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">through glory and dishonour, through evil report and good report: as deceivers, and true;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">as unknown, and well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as disciplined, and not put to death;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">as grieved, but always rejoicing; as poor, but enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Our mouth is opened to you, Corinthians, our heart is expanded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your affections;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">but for an answering recompense, (I speak as to children,) let your heart also expand itself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Be not diversely yoked with unbelievers; for what participation [is there] between righteousness and lawlessness? or what fellowship of light with darkness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and what consent of Christ with Beliar, or what part for a believer along with an unbeliever?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">and what agreement of God’s temple with idols? for ye are [the] living God’s temple; according as God has said, I will dwell among them, and walk among [them]; and I will be their God, and they shall be to me a people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Wherefore come out from the midst of them, and be separated, saith [the] Lord, and touch not [what is] unclean, and I will receive you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">and I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, saith [the] Lord Almighty.</p>
