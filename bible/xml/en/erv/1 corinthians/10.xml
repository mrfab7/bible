<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="10" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, how that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;</verse>
  <verse number="2">and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and did all eat the same spiritual meat;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Howbeit with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Neither let us tempt the Lord, as some of them tempted, and perished by the serpents.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Now these things happened unto them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.</verse>
  <verse number="13">There hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ?</verse>
  <verse number="17">seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we all partake of the one bread.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they which eat the sacrifices communion with the altar?</verse>
  <verse number="19">What say I then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?</verse>
  <verse number="20">But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have communion with devils.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of devils.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?</verse>
  <verse number="23">All things are lawful; but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful; but all things edify not.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Let no man seek his own, but each his neighbour’s good.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience sake;</verse>
  <verse number="26">for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="27">If one of them that believe not biddeth you to a feast, and ye are disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But if any man say unto you, This hath been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake:</verse>
  <verse number="29">conscience, I say, not thine own, but the other’s; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience?</verse>
  <verse number="30">If I by grace partake, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?</verse>
  <verse number="31">Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Give no occasion of stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God:</verse>
  <verse number="33">even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved.</verse>
