<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I will say to God, Do not condemn me; show me why thou contendest with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is it good to thee that thou shouldst oppress, that thou shouldst despise the work of thy hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as manâ€™s days,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">That thou inquirest after my iniquity, and searchest after my sin?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thy hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Thy hands have made me and fashioned me in all my parts; yet thou dost destroy me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Thou hast granted me life and favor, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And these things hast thou hid in thy heart: I know that this is with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from my iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If I be wicked, woe to me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou my affliction;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou showest thyself wonderful upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thy indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Why then hast thou brought me forth from the womb? O that I had expired, and no eye had seen me!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness, and the shades of death;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shades of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.</p>
