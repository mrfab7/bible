  <verse number="1">After this, Jesus crossed to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (that is, the Sea of Tiberias).</verse>
  <verse number="2">A large crowd followed Him because they saw the signs He was performing on the sick.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then Jesus went up on the mountain and sat down with His disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Now the Jewish Feast of the Passover was near.</verse>
  <verse number="5">When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward Him, He said to Philip, “Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?”</verse>
  <verse number="6">But He was asking this to test him, for He knew what He was about to do.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Philip answered, “Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each of them to have a small piece.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to Him,</verse>
  <verse number="9">“Here is a boy with five barley loaves and two small fish. But what difference will these make among so many?”</verse>
  <verse number="10">“Have the people sit down,” Jesus said. Now there was plenty of grass in that place, so the men sat down, about five thousand of them.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then Jesus took the loaves and the fish, gave thanks, and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And when everyone was full, He said to His disciples, “Gather the pieces that are left over, so that nothing will be wasted.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">So they collected them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.</verse>
  <verse number="14">When the people saw the sign that Jesus had performed, they began to say, “Truly this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then Jesus, realizing that they were about to come and make Him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by Himself.</verse>
  <verse number="16">When evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,</verse>
  <verse number="17">got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was already dark, and Jesus had not yet gone out to them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">A strong wind was blowing, and the sea grew agitated.</verse>
  <verse number="19">When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus approaching the boat, walking on the sea—and they were terrified.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But Jesus spoke up: “It is I; do not be afraid.”</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then they were willing to take Him into the boat, and at once the boat reached the shore where they were heading.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The next day, the crowd that had remained on the other side of the sea realized that only one boat had been there, and that Jesus had not boarded it with His disciples, but they had gone away alone.</verse>
  <verse number="23">However, some boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</verse>
  <verse number="24">So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum to look for Him.</verse>
  <verse number="25">When they found Him on the other side of the sea, they asked Him, “Rabbi, when did You get here?”</verse>
  <verse number="26">Jesus replied, “Truly, truly, I tell you, it is not because you saw these signs that you are looking for Me, but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Do not work for food that perishes, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. For on Him God the Father has placed His seal of approval.”</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then they inquired, “What must we do to perform the works of God?”</verse>
  <verse number="29">Jesus replied, “The work of God is this: to believe in the One He has sent.”</verse>
  <verse number="30">So they asked Him, “What sign then will You perform, so that we may see it and believe You? What will You do?</verse>
  <verse number="31">Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, as it is written: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”</verse>
  <verse number="32">Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I tell you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="33">For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”</verse>
  <verse number="34">“Sir,” they said, “give us this bread at all times.”</verse>
  <verse number="35">Jesus answered, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to Me will never hunger, and whoever believes in Me will never thirst.</verse>
  <verse number="36">But as I stated, you have seen Me and still you do not believe.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Everyone the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will never drive away.</verse>
  <verse number="38">For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but to do the will of Him who sent Me.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that I shall lose none of those He has given Me, but raise them up at the last day.</verse>
  <verse number="40">For it is My Father’s will that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in Him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.”</verse>
  <verse number="41">At this, the Jews began to grumble about Jesus because He had said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.”</verse>
  <verse number="42">They were asking, “Is this not Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then can He say, ‘I have come down from heaven?’”</verse>
  <verse number="43">“Stop grumbling among yourselves,” Jesus replied.</verse>
  <verse number="44">“No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him, and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
  <verse number="45">It is written in the Prophets: ‘And they will all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard the Father and learned from Him comes to Me—</verse>
  <verse number="46">not that anyone has seen the Father except the One who is from God; only He has seen the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="47">Truly, truly, I tell you, he who believes has eternal life.</verse>
  <verse number="48">I am the bread of life.</verse>
  <verse number="49">Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, yet they died.</verse>
  <verse number="50">This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that anyone may eat of it and not die.</verse>
  <verse number="51">I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever. And this bread, which I will give for the life of the world, is My flesh.”</verse>
  <verse number="52">At this, the Jews began to argue among themselves, “How can this man give us His flesh to eat?”</verse>
  <verse number="53">So Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh and drink the blood of the Son of Man, you have no life in you.</verse>
  <verse number="54">Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
  <verse number="55">For My flesh is real food, and My blood is real drink.</verse>
  <verse number="56">Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood remains in Me, and I in him.</verse>
  <verse number="57">Just as the living Father sent Me and I live because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on Me will live because of Me.</verse>
  <verse number="58">This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your fathers, who ate the manna and died, the one who eats this bread will live forever.”</verse>
  <verse number="59">Jesus said this while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.</verse>
  <verse number="60">On hearing it, many of His disciples said, “This is a difficult teaching. Who can accept it?”</verse>
  <verse number="61">Aware that His disciples were grumbling about this teaching, Jesus asked them, “Does this offend you?</verse>
  <verse number="62">Then what will happen if you see the Son of Man ascend to where He was before?</verse>
  <verse number="63">The Spirit gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and they are life.</verse>
  <verse number="64">However, there are some of you who do not believe.” (For Jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray Him.)</verse>
  <verse number="65">Then Jesus said, “This is why I told you that no one can come to Me unless the Father has granted it to him.”</verse>
  <verse number="66">From that time on many of His disciples turned back and no longer walked with Him.</verse>
  <verse number="67">So Jesus asked the Twelve, “Do you want to leave too?”</verse>
  <verse number="68">Simon Peter replied, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.</verse>
  <verse number="69">We believe and know that You are the Holy One of God.”</verse>
  <verse number="70">Jesus answered them, “Have I not chosen you, the Twelve? Yet one of you is a devil!”</verse>
  <verse number="71">He was speaking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. For although Judas was one of the Twelve, he was later to betray Jesus.</verse>
