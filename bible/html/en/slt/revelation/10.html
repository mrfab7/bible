<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And I saw another strong angel coming down from heaven, surrounded with a cloud: and a rainbow upon the head, and his face as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he had in his hand a small book opened: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and the left upon the earth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he cried with a great voice, as a lion roars: and when he cried, the seven thunders spake their voices.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And when the seven thunders spake their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying to me, Seal what the seven thunders spake, and thou mayest not write these.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the angel which I saw standing upon the sea and upon earth lifted up his hand to heaven,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And sware by him living for ever and ever, who created the heaven, and all in it, and earth, and all things in it, and the sea, and all in it, that time shall be no more:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he should be about to sound the trumpet, and the mystery of God should be finished, as he announced the good news to his servants the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the voice which I heard from heaven again speaking with me, and saying, Go, take the little book opened in the hand of the angel having stood upon the sea and upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And I came forth to the angel, saying to him, Give me the little book. And he said to me, Take, and eat it up; and it shall render thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth shall it be sweet as honey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I took the small book from the angelâ€™s hand, and I was eating it; and in my mouth was as honey, sweet: and when I ate it, my belly was bitter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And he says to me, Thou must again prophesy to peoples, and nations, and tongues, and many kings.</p>
