<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“No doubt, but you are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Yes, who doesn’t know such things as these?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor, I, who called on God, and he answered. The just, the blameless man is a joke.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune. It is ready for them whose foot slips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The tents of robbers prosper. Those who provoke God are secure, who carry their God in their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">“But ask the animals, now, and they shall teach you; the birds of the sky, and they shall tell you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach you. The fish of the sea shall declare to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who doesn’t know that in all these, the hand of Yahweh has done this,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">in whose hand is the life of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Doesn’t the ear try words, even as the palate tastes its food?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">With aged men is wisdom, in length of days understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">“With God is wisdom and might. He has counsel and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Behold, he breaks down, and it can’t be built again. He imprisons a man, and there can be no release.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up. Again, he sends them out, and they overturn the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">With him is strength and wisdom. The deceived and the deceiver are his.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He leads counselors away stripped. He makes judges fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He loosens the bond of kings. He binds their waist with a belt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He leads priests away stripped, and overthrows the mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He removes the speech of those who are trusted, and takes away the understanding of the elders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He pours contempt on princes, and loosens the belt of the strong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He uncovers deep things out of darkness, and brings out to light the shadow of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He increases the nations, and he destroys them. He enlarges the nations, and he leads them captive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth, and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">They grope in the dark without light. He makes them stagger like a drunken man.</p>
