  <verse number="1">“Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went out to meet the bridegroom.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them,</verse>
  <verse number="4">but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But at midnight there was a cry, ‘Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!’</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’</verse>
  <verse number="9">But the wise answered, saying, ‘What if there isn’t enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.’</verse>
  <verse number="10">While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, ‘Lord, Lord, open to us.’</verse>
  <verse number="12">But he answered, ‘Most certainly I tell you, I don’t know you.’</verse>
  <verse number="13">Watch therefore, for you don’t know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.</verse>
  <verse number="14">“For it is like a man, going into another country, who called his own servants, and entrusted his goods to them.</verse>
  <verse number="15">To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one; to each according to his own ability. Then he went on his journey.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Immediately he who received the five talents went and traded with them, and made another five talents.</verse>
  <verse number="17">In the same way, he also who got the two gained another two.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But he who received the one went away and dug in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.</verse>
  <verse number="19">“Now after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reconciled accounts with them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">He who received the five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, ‘Lord, you delivered to me five talents. Behold, I have gained another five talents besides them.’</verse>
  <verse number="21">“His lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.’</verse>
  <verse number="22">“He also who got the two talents came and said, ‘Lord, you delivered to me two talents. Behold, I have gained another two talents besides them.’</verse>
  <verse number="23">“His lord said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a few things, I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord.’</verse>
  <verse number="24">“He also who had received the one talent came and said, ‘Lord, I knew you that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.</verse>
  <verse number="25">I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth. Behold, you have what is yours.’</verse>
  <verse number="26">“But his lord answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant. You knew that I reap where I didn’t sow, and gather where I didn’t scatter.</verse>
  <verse number="27">You ought therefore to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received back my own with interest.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Take away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who has the ten talents.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance, but from him who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’</verse>
  <verse number="31">“But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Before him all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.</verse>
  <verse number="33">He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Then the King will tell those on his right hand, ‘Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;</verse>
  <verse number="35">for I was hungry, and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you took me in.</verse>
  <verse number="36">I was naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and you visited me. I was in prison, and you came to me.’</verse>
  <verse number="37">“Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty, and give you a drink?</verse>
  <verse number="38">When did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you?</verse>
  <verse number="39">When did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?’</verse>
  <verse number="40">“The King will answer them, ‘Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’</verse>
  <verse number="41">Then he will say also to those on the left hand, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels;</verse>
  <verse number="42">for I was hungry, and you didn’t give me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;</verse>
  <verse number="43">I was a stranger, and you didn’t take me in; naked, and you didn’t clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you didn’t visit me.’</verse>
  <verse number="44">“Then they will also answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and didn’t help you?’</verse>
  <verse number="45">“Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Most certainly I tell you, inasmuch as you didn’t do it to one of the least of these, you didn’t do it to me.’</verse>
  <verse number="46">These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”</verse>
