1	Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fishâ€™s belly.
2	And he said, I called by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he answered me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice.
3	For thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, and the flood was round about me; all thy waves and thy billows passed over me.
4	And I said, am cast out from before thine eyes; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.
5	The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; the deep was round about me; the weeds were wrapped about my head.
6	I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars closed upon me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God.
7	When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.
8	They that regard lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
9	But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.
10	And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
