<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“If one ventures a word with you, will you be wearied? Yet who can keep from speaking?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Surely you have instructed many, and have strengthened their feeble hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Your words have steadied those who stumbled; you have braced the knees that were buckling.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But now trouble has come upon you, and you are weary. It strikes you, and you are dismayed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Is your reverence not your confidence, and the uprightness of your ways your hope?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Consider now, I plead: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Or where have the upright been destroyed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">As I have observed, those who plow iniquity and those who sow trouble reap the same.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of His anger they are consumed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The lion may roar, and the fierce lion may growl, yet the teeth of the young lions are broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now a word came to me secretly; my ears caught a whisper of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">In disquieting visions in the night, when deep sleep falls on men,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">fear and trembling came over me and made all my bones shudder.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Then a spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body bristled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance; a form loomed before my eyes, and I heard a whispering voice:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">‘Can a mortal be more righteous than God, or a man more pure than his Maker?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If God puts no trust in His servants, and He charges His angels with error,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">how much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who can be crushed like a moth!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">They are smashed to pieces from dawn to dusk; unnoticed, they perish forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Are not their tent cords pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?’</p>
