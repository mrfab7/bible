<chapter book="2 Timothy" number="3" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And this know thou, that in the last days there shall come perilous times,</verse>
  <verse number="2">for men shall be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, evil-speakers, to parents disobedient, unthankful, unkind,</verse>
  <verse number="3">without natural affection, implacable, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, not lovers of those who are good,</verse>
  <verse number="4">traitors, heady, lofty, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God,</verse>
  <verse number="5">having a form of piety, and its power having denied; and from these be turning away,</verse>
  <verse number="6">for of these there are those coming into the houses and leading captive the silly women, laden with sins, led away with desires manifold,</verse>
  <verse number="7">always learning, and never to a knowledge of truth able to come,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and, even as Jannes and Jambres stood against Moses, so also these do stand against the truth, men corrupted in mind, disapproved concerning the faith;</verse>
  <verse number="9">but they shall not advance any further, for their folly shall be manifest to all, as theirs also did become.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And thou—thou hast followed after my teaching, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, love, endurance,</verse>
  <verse number="11">the persecutions, the afflictions, that befell me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of all the Lord did deliver me,</verse>
  <verse number="12">and all also who will to live piously in Christ Jesus shall be persecuted,</verse>
  <verse number="13">and evil men and impostors shall advance to the worse, leading astray and being led astray.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And thou—be remaining in the things which thou didst learn and wast entrusted with, having known from whom thou didst learn,</verse>
  <verse number="15">and because from a babe the Holy Writings thou hast known, which are able to make thee wise—to salvation, through faith that is in Christ Jesus;</verse>
  <verse number="16">every Writing is God-breathed, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for setting aright, for instruction that is in righteousness,</verse>
  <verse number="17">that the man of God may be fitted—for every good work having been completed.</verse>
