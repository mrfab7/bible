<p class="verse" data-verse="1">WHAT advantage then hath the Jew, or what is the profit of circumcision?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Much every way. First indeed, because the words of God were committed to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For what if some of them have not believed? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But God is true; and every man a liar, as it is written, That thou mayest be justified in thy words, and mayest overcome when thou art judged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But if our injustice commend the justice of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust, who executeth wrath?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">(I speak according to man.) God forbid: otherwise how shall God judge this world?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie, unto his glory, why am I also yet judged as a sinner?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And not rather (as we are slandered, and as some affirm that we say) let us do evil, that there may come good? whose damnation is just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What then? Do we excel them? No, not so. For we have charged both Jews, and Greeks, that they are all under sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">As it is written: There is not any man just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">All have turned out of the way; they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, there is not so much as one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have dealt deceitfully. The venom of asps is under their lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Their feet swift to shed blood:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Destruction and misery in their ways:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the way of peace they have not known:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">There is no fear of God before their eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Now we know, that what things soever the law speaketh, it speaketh to them that are in the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be made subject to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before him. For by the law is the knowledge of sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But now without the law the justice of God is made manifest, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Even the justice of God, by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all them that believe in him: for there is no distinction:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For all have sinned, and do need the glory of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption, that is in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to the shewing of his justice, for the remission of former sins,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Through the forbearance of God, for the shewing of his justice in this time; that he himself may be just, and the justifier of him, who is of the faith of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Where is then thy boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For we account a man to be justified by faith, without the works of the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">For it is one God, that justifieth circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Do we, then, destroy the law through faith? God forbid: but we establish the law.</p>
