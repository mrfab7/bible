  <verse number="1">Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Who [is] this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;</verse>
  <verse number="7">When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Or [who] shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, [as if] it had issued out of the womb?</verse>
  <verse number="9">When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,</verse>
  <verse number="10">And brake up for it my decreed [place], and set bars and doors,</verse>
  <verse number="11">And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; [and] caused the dayspring to know his place;</verse>
  <verse number="13">That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?</verse>
  <verse number="14">It is turned as clay [to] the seal; and they stand as a garment.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?</verse>
  <verse number="17">Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Where [is] the way [where] light dwelleth? and [as for] darkness, where [is] the place thereof,</verse>
  <verse number="20">That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths [to] the house thereof?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Knowest thou [it], because thou wast then born? or [because] the number of thy days [is] great?</verse>
  <verse number="22">Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?</verse>
  <verse number="24">By what way is the light parted, [which] scattereth the east wind upon the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="25">Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;</verse>
  <verse number="26">To cause it to rain on the earth, [where] no man [is; on] the wilderness, wherein [there is] no man;</verse>
  <verse number="27">To satisfy the desolate and waste [ground]; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?</verse>
  <verse number="28">Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?</verse>
  <verse number="29">Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?</verse>
  <verse number="30">The waters are hid as [with] a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?</verse>
  <verse number="32">Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?</verse>
  <verse number="33">Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="34">Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?</verse>
  <verse number="35">Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we [are]?</verse>
  <verse number="36">Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?</verse>
  <verse number="37">Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,</verse>
  <verse number="38">When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?</verse>
  <verse number="39">Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,</verse>
  <verse number="40">When they couch in [their] dens, [and] abide in the covert to lie in wait?</verse>
  <verse number="41">Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.</verse>
