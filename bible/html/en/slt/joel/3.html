<p class="verse" data-verse="1">For behold, in those days and in that time when I shall turn hack the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And I gathered all nations, and I brought them down to the valley of Jehoshophat, and I contended with them there for my people and mine inheritance Israel whom they scattered among the nations, and they divided the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And for my people they cast the lot: and they will give the boy for a harlot, and they sold the girl for wine; and they will drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And also what are ye to me, O Tyre and Sidon, and all the circuits of Philistia? do ye requite to me a recompense? and if ye recompense to me, swiftly and speedily I will turn back your recompense upon your head;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For ye took my silver and my gold, and my delights of good things ye brought to your temples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem ye sold to the sons of the Grecians, in order to remove them far off from their border.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold me raising them up from the place where ye sold them there, and I turned back your recompense upon your head:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And I sold your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they sold them to the Sabeans to a nation far off: for Jehovah spake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Call ye this among the nations: Consecrate war; rouse up the strong ones, they shall draw near, all the men of war shall come up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Beat your plough-shares into swords, and your pruning-knives into spears: the weak shall say, I am strong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Hasten and come all ye nations from round about, and be ye gathered together: there lead down, O Jehovah, thy strong ones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The nations shall be roused and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there I will sit to judge all the nations from round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Send ye forth the sickle, for the harvest was ripened: come ye, go down, for the wine press was filled, the vats, overflowed; for their evil is great.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of judgment: for the day of Jehovah is near in the valley of judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The sun and the moon were darkened, and the stars took away their shining.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Jehovah shall cry out from Zion, and from Jerusalem he shall give his voice; and the heavens and the earth trembled: and Jehovah the refuge to his people, and the fortress to the sons of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And ye knew that I am Jehovah your God dwelling in Zion my holy mountain: and Jerusalem was holy, and strangers shall no more pass through her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And it was in that day the mountains shall drop new wine, and the hills shall flow milk, and all the channels of Judah shall flow waters, and a fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah, and it watered the valley of acacias.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Egypt shall be for a desolation, and Edom shall be for a desert of desolation from violence to the sons of Judah, because they poured out innocent blood in their land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Judah shall dwell forever, and Jerusalem to generation and generation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And I cleansed their blood I cleansed not: and Jehovah dwelt in Zion.</p>
