<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Proverbs of Solomon. A wise son will gladden a father: and a son of the foolish will grieve his mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Treasures of injustice shall not profit, and justice shall deliver from death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Jehovah will not cause the soul of the just one to hunger: and he will thrust away the desire of the unjust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A slothful hand makes poverty, and the hand of the active will make rich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He gathering in summer, is a prudent son: he lying in deep sleep in harvest, a son causing shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Blessings upon the head of the just one: and violence shall cover the mouth of the unjust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The memory of the just one for blessing: and the name of the wicked shall be rotten.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The wise of heart will receive commands: and the foolish of lips shall fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He going in integrity shall go confidently: and he perverting his ways shall be known.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He pinching the eye shall give pain: and the foolish of lips shall fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">A fountain of life the mouth of the just one: and violence shall cover the mouth of the unjust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Hatred will excite strifes: and love will cover over all transgressions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">In the lips of him understanding, wisdom shall be found: and a rod for the back of him wanting heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The wise shall hide knowledge: and the mouth of the foolish drew near destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The wealth of the rich his strong city: the destruction of the poor their poverty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The labors of the just one, to life: the increase of the unjust to sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The path to life is watching instruction: and he forsaking reproof goes astray.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He covering hatred with lips of falsehood, and he bringing forth slander, is foolish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">In the multitude of words transgression shall not cease: and he withholding his lips is prudent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The tongue of the just is choice silver: the heart of the unjust is as little.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The lips of the just one shall feed many: and fools in wanting heart, shall die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The blessing of Jehovah it will make rich, and it will not add pain with it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">As laughter to the foolish one, to do mischief: and wisdom is to the man of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The fear of the unjust one it shall come to him: and the desire of the just shall be given.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">As the whirlwind passing away the unjust one is not: and the just one a foundation forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">As vinegar to the teeth and as smoke to the eyes, so is the slothful one to those sending him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The fear of Jehovah will add days, and the years of the unjust shall be diminished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The hope of the just is gladness: and the expectation of the unjust shall perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">The way of Jehovah is a fortress to the upright one: and destruction to those doing iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The just one shall not be moved forever: and the unjust shall not inhabit the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The mouth of the just one shall germinate wisdom: and the tongue of perverseness shall be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">The lips of the just one shall know acceptance: and the mouth of the unjust, perverseness.</p>
