  <verse number="1">AND I, brethren, could not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. As unto little ones in Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I gave you milk to drink, not meat; for you were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now able; for you are yet carnal.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For, whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal, and walk according to man ?</verse>
  <verse number="4">For while one saith, I indeed am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollo; are you not men ? What then is Apollo, and what is Paul?</verse>
  <verse number="5">The ministers of him whom you have believed; and to every one as the Lord hath given.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I have planted, Apollo watered, but God gave the increase.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore, neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now he that planteth, and he that watereth, are one. And every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For we are God’s coadjutors: you are God’s husbandry; you are God’s building.</verse>
  <verse number="10">According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid; which is Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now if any man build upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble:</verse>
  <verse number="13">Every man’s work shall be manifest; for the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work, of what sort it is.</verse>
  <verse number="14">If any man’s work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</verse>
  <verse number="15">If any man’s work burn, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Know you not, that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you ?</verse>
  <verse number="17">But if any man violate the temple of God, him shall God destroy. For the temple of God is holy, which you are.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Let no man deceive himself: if any man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written: I will catch the wise in their own craftiness.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And again: The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Let no man therefore glory in men.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For all things are yours, whether it be Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to some; for all are yours;</verse>
  <verse number="23">And you are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.</verse>
