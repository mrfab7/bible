  <verse number="1">And Jehovah answereth Job out of the whirlwind, and saith:—</verse>
  <verse number="2">Who is this—darkening counsel, By words without knowledge?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Gird, I pray thee, as a man, thy loins, And I ask thee, and cause thou Me to know.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Where wast thou when I founded earth? Declare, if thou hast known understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Who placed its measures—if thou knowest? Or who hath stretched out upon it a line?</verse>
  <verse number="6">On what have its sockets been sunk? Or who hath cast its corner-stone?</verse>
  <verse number="7">In the singing together of stars of morning, And all sons of God shout for joy,</verse>
  <verse number="8">And He shutteth up with doors the sea, In its coming forth, from the womb it goeth out.</verse>
  <verse number="9">In My making a cloud its clothing, And thick darkness its swaddling band,</verse>
  <verse number="10">And I measure over it My statute, And place bar and doors,</verse>
  <verse number="11">And say, ‘Hitherto come thou, and add not, And a command is placed On the pride of thy billows.’</verse>
  <verse number="12">Hast thou commanded morning since thy days? Causest thou the dawn to know its place?</verse>
  <verse number="13">To take hold on the skirts of the earth, And the wicked are shaken out of it,</verse>
  <verse number="14">It turneth itself as clay of a seal And they station themselves as clothed.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And withheld from the wicked is their light, And the arm lifted up is broken.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Hast thou come in to springs of the sea? And in searching the deep Hast thou walked up and down?</verse>
  <verse number="17">Revealed to thee were the gates of death? And the gates of death-shade dost thou see?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Thou hast understanding, Even unto the broad places of earth! Declare—if thou hast known it all.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Where is this—the way light dwelleth? And darkness, where is this—its place?</verse>
  <verse number="20">That thou dost take it unto its boundary, And that thou dost understand The paths of its house.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Thou hast known—for then thou art born And the number of thy days are many!</verse>
  <verse number="22">Hast thou come in unto the treasure of snow? Yea, the treasures of hail dost thou see?</verse>
  <verse number="23">That I have kept back for a time of distress, For a day of conflict and battle.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Where is this, the way light is apportioned? It scattereth an east wind over the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Who hath divided for the flood a conduit? And a way for the lightning of the voices?</verse>
  <verse number="26">To cause it to rain on a land—no man, A wilderness—no man in it.</verse>
  <verse number="27">To satisfy a desolate and waste place, And to cause to shoot up The produce of the tender grass?</verse>
  <verse number="28">Hath the rain a father? Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?</verse>
  <verse number="29">From whose belly came forth the ice? And the hoar-frost of the heavens, Who hath begotten it?</verse>
  <verse number="30">As a stone waters are hidden, And the face of the deep is captured.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Dost thou bind sweet influences of Kimah? Or the attractions of Kesil dost thou open?</verse>
  <verse number="32">Dost thou bring out Mazzaroth in its season? And Aysh for her sons dost thou comfort?</verse>
  <verse number="33">Hast thou known the statutes of heaven? Or dost thou appoint Its dominion in the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="34">Dost thou lift up to the cloud thy voice, And abundance of water doth cover thee?</verse>
  <verse number="35">Dost thou send out lightnings, and they go And say unto thee, ‘Behold us?’</verse>
  <verse number="36">Who hath put in the inward parts wisdom? Or who hath given To the covered part understanding?</verse>
  <verse number="37">Who doth number the clouds by wisdom? And the bottles of the heavens, Who doth cause to lie down,</verse>
  <verse number="38">In the hardening of dust into hardness, And clods cleave together?</verse>
  <verse number="39">Dost thou hunt for a lion prey? And the desire of young lions fulfil?</verse>
  <verse number="40">When they bow down in dens—Abide in a thicket for a covert?</verse>
  <verse number="41">Who doth prepare for a raven his provision, When his young ones cry unto God? They wander without food.</verse>
