<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And when any one will present an oblation to Jehovah, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense thereon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons, the priests; and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial thereof on the altar, an offering by fire to Jehovah of a sweet odour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the remainder of the oblation shall be Aaron’s and his sons’: [it is] most holy of Jehovah’s offerings by fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And if thou present an offering of an oblation baken in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And if thine offering be an oblation [baken] on the pan, it shall be fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is an oblation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And if thine offering be an oblation [prepared] in the cauldron, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And thou shalt bring the oblation that is made of these things to Jehovah; and it shall be presented to the priest, and he shall bring it to the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the priest shall take from the oblation a memorial thereof, and shall burn it on the altar, an offering by fire to Jehovah of a sweet odour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the remainder of the oblation [shall be] Aaron’s and his sons’: [it is] most holy of Jehovah’s offerings by fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">No oblation which ye shall present to Jehovah shall be made with leaven; for no leaven and no honey shall ye burn [in] any fire-offering to Jehovah.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And if thou present an oblation of thy first-fruits to Jehovah, thou shalt present as the oblation of thy first-fruits green ears of corn roasted in fire, corn beaten out of full ears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And thou shalt put oil on it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is an oblation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the priest shall burn the memorial thereof, [part] of the beaten corn thereof, and [part] of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: [it is] an offering by fire to Jehovah.</p>
