<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="38" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah will answer Job from the whirlwind, and he will say,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Who this darkening counsel in words without knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Gird now thy loins as a man; and I will ask thee, and make thou known to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Where wert thou in my founding the earth? Announce, if thou knewest understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who set its measures, if thou shalt know? or who stretched the line upon it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Upon what were its bases impressed? or who placed its corner-stone?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In the rejoicing together of the stars of morning, and all the sons of God will shout for joy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he will hedge in the sea with doors in its breaking forth, going forth from the womb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">In my making the cloud its garment, and darkness its bandage:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I shall break upon it my law, and I shall set bars and doors;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And saying, Even to this shalt thou come, and thou shalt not add: and here in the pride of thy waves, stand thou.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">In thy days didst thou command the morning? and didst thou make the dawning know its place?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">To take hold upon the wings of the earth, and the unjust shall be shaken out of it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">It shall be turned as clay to the seal; and they shall stand as clothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And their light shall be withheld from the unjust, and the high arm shall be broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Didst thou go even to the fountains of the sea? and didst thou go about in searching the depth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Were the gates of death uncovered to thee? and shalt thou see the gates of the shadow of death?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Wilt thou consider even to the breadth of the earth? Announce if thou knewest all of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Where the way light shall dwell? and darkness, where its place?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">That thou shalt take it to its bound, and that thou shalt understand the beaten paths of its house?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Knewest thou? for shalt thou then be born, and the number of thy days great?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Didst thou come into the treasures of snow? and shalt thou see the treasures of hail,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Which I kept back for the time of straits, for the day of encounter and war?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Where that way the light will divide, it will scatter the east wind upon the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Who divided a channel for the overflowing, and a way for the lightning of the voices?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">To cause it to rain upon the earth, not a man; the wilderness not a man in it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">To satisfy the desolation and burning, and to cause the springing up of the finding of the tender grass?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Is there a father to the rain? or who begat the reservoirs of the dew?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">From whose womb came forth the ice? and the hoarfrost of the heavens, who brought it forth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The waters shall be hid as a stone, and the face of the depth will be taken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Wilt thou bind the bands of the cluster, or wilt thou open the cords of Orion?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Wilt thou bring forth the twelve signs in its time? and the great bear and his sons, wilt thou guide them?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Knewest thou the laws of the heavens? or wilt thou set up its dominion in the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Wilt thou lift up thy voice to the cloud, and abundance of waters shall cover thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Shalt thou send lightnings, and shall they go and shall they say to thee, Behold us?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Who put wisdom in the reins? or who gave understanding to the mind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Who shall number the clouds in wisdom? and who shall cause the bottles of heaven to lie down?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">In the pouring out of the dust into a melted mass, and the clods will adhere.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? and wilt thou fill up the life of the young lions?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">For they will sink down in the dwellings; they will dwell in the thicket to lie in wait.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Who will prepare for the raven his food? for his young will cry to God; they will wander without food.</p>
