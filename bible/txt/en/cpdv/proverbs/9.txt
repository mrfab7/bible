1	Wisdom has built a house for herself. She has hewn seven columns.
2	She has immolated her victims. She has mixed her wine and set forth her table.
3	She has sent her maids to call out to the tower and to the fortified walls of the city,
4	“If anyone is little, let him come to me.” And to the unwise, she has said:
5	“Approach. Eat my bread, and drink the wine that I have mixed for you.
6	Leave behind childishness. And live and walk by the ways of prudence.”
7	Whoever teaches a mocker causes injury to himself. And whoever argues with the impious produces a blemish on himself.
8	Do not be willing to argue with a mocker, lest he hate you. Dispute with the wise, and he will love you.
9	Present an opportunity to the wise, and wisdom shall be added to him. Teach the just, and he will hurry to receive it.
10	The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of holiness is prudence.
11	For by me, your days will be multiplied and years of life will be added to you.
12	If you would be wise, you will be so for yourself. But if you would be one who ridicules, you alone shall carry the evil.
13	A foolish and loud woman, who is full of enticements and who knows nothing at all,
14	sat at the entrance of her house on a seat, in a high place of the city,
15	so as to call to those who were passing by the way and continuing on their journey:
16	“Whoever is little, let him turn aside to me.” And to the frenzied, she said,
17	“Stolen waters are more soothing, and secret bread is more pleasant.”
18	And he did not know that giants are there, and that her companions are in the depths of Hell.
