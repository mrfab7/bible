<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="3" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and he said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said: A man child is conceived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Let that day be turned into darkness, let not God regard it from above, and let not the light shine upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Let darkness, and the shadow of death cover it, let a mist overspread it, and let it be wrapped up in bitterness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Let a darksome whirlwind seize upon that night, let it not be counted in the days of the year, nor numbered in the months.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Let that night be solitary, and not worthy of praise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Let them curse it who curse the day. who are ready to raise up a leviathan:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Let the stars be darkened with the mist thereof: let it expect light and not see it, nor the rising of the dawning of the day:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me, nor took away evils from my eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Why did I not die in the womb, why did I not perish when I came out of the belly?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Why received upon the knees? why suckled at the breasts ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For now I should have been asleep and still, and should have rest in my sleep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">With kings and consuls of the earth, who build themselves solitudes:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Or with princes, that possess gold, and All their houses with silver:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Or as a hidden untimely birth I should not be, or as they that being conceived have not seen the light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">There the wicked cease from tumult, and there the wearied in strength are at rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And they sometime bound together without disquiet, have not heard the voice of the oppressor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The small and great are there, and the servant is free from his master.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to them that are in bitterness of soul?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">That look for death, and it cometh not, as they that dig for a treasure:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And they rejoice exceedingly when they have found the grave.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">To a man whose way is hidden, and God hath surrounded him with darkness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Before I eat I sigh: and as overflowing waters, so is my roaring:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For the fear which I feared hath come upon me: and that which I was afraid of, hath befallen me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Have I not dissembled ? have I not kept silence ? have I not been quiet? and indignation is come upon me.</p>
