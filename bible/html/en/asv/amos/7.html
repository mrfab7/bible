<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king’s mowings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it came to pass that, when they made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I beseech thee: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Jehovah repented concerning this: It shall not be, saith Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thus the Lord Jehovah showed me: and, behold, the Lord Jehovah called to contend by fire; and it devoured the great deep, and would have eaten up the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then said I, O Lord Jehovah, cease, I beseech thee: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Jehovah repented concerning this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thus he showed me: and, behold, the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Jehovah said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumb-line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thou away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">but prophesy not again any more at Beth-el; for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is a royal house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdsman, and a dresser of sycomore-trees:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and Jehovah took me from following the flock, and Jehovah said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Now therefore hear thou the word of Jehovah: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the house of Isaac;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">therefore thus saith Jehovah: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou thyself shalt die in a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.</p>
