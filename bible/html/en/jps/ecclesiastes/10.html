<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Dead flies make the ointment of the perfumer fetid and putrid; So doth a little folly outweigh wisdom and honour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A wise man’s understanding is at his right hand; But a fool’s understanding at his left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Yea also, when a fool walketh by the way, his understanding faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, Leave not thy place; For gentleness allayeth great offences.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, Like an error which proceedeth from a ruler:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Folly is set on great heights, And the rich sit in low place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I have seen servants upon horses, And princes walking as servants upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; And whoso breaketh through a fence, a serpent shall bite him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Whoso quarrieth stones shall be hurt therewith; And he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If the iron be blunt, And one do not whet the edge, Then must he put to more strength; But wisdom is profitable to direct.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If the serpent bite before it is charmed, Then the charmer hath no advantage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; But the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; And the end of his talk is grievous madness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">A fool also multiplieth words; Yet man knoweth not what shall be; And that which shall be after him, Who can tell him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The labour of fools wearieth every one of them, For he knoweth not how to go to the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a boy, And thy princes feast in the morning!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is a free man, And thy princes eat in due season, In strength, and not in drunkenness!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">By slothfulness the rafters sink in; And through idleness of the hands the house leaketh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A feast is made for laughter, And wine maketh glad the life; And money answereth all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Curse not the king, no, not in thy thought, And curse not the rich in thy bedchamber; For a bird of the air shall carry the voice, And that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</p>
