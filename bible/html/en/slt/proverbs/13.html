<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A wise son the instruction of a father: and he mocking heard not reproof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">From the fruit of a man’s mouth he shall eat good: and the soul of the transgressing, violence.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The law of the wise one a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Good understanding shall give grace: and the way of the transgressing is perpetuity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Every prudent one will do in knowledge: and the foolish one will spread folly.</p>
