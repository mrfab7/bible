<chapter book="Proverbs" number="6" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbor, If thou hast stricken thy hands for a stranger;</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, Thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, Seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbor: Go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbor;</verse>
  <verse number="4">Give not sleep to thine eyes, Nor slumber to thine eyelids;</verse>
  <verse number="5">Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Go to the ant, thou sluggard; Consider her ways, and be wise:</verse>
  <verse number="7">Which having no chief, Overseer, or ruler,</verse>
  <verse number="8">Provideth her bread in the summer, And gathereth her food in the harvest.</verse>
  <verse number="9">How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep:</verse>
  <verse number="11">So shall thy poverty come as a robber, And thy want as an armed man.</verse>
  <verse number="12">A worthless person, a man of iniquity, Is he that walketh with a perverse mouth;</verse>
  <verse number="13">That winketh with his eyes, that speaketh with his feet, That maketh signs with his fingers;</verse>
  <verse number="14">In whose heart is perverseness, Who deviseth evil continually, Who soweth discord.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; On a sudden shall he be broken, and that without remedy.</verse>
  <verse number="16">There are six things which Jehovah hateth; Yea, seven which are an abomination unto him:</verse>
  <verse number="17">Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood;</verse>
  <verse number="18">A heart that deviseth wicked purposes, Feet that are swift in running to mischief,</verse>
  <verse number="19">A false witness that uttereth lies, And he that soweth discord among brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My son, keep the commandment of thy father, And forsake not the law of thy mother:</verse>
  <verse number="21">Bind them continually upon thy heart; Tie them about thy neck.</verse>
  <verse number="22">When thou walkest, it shall lead thee; When thou sleepest, it shall watch over thee; And when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; And reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</verse>
  <verse number="24">To keep thee from the evil woman, From the flattery of the foreigner’s tongue.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; Neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a piece of bread; And the adulteress hunteth for the precious life.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Can a man take fire in his bosom, And his clothes not be burned?</verse>
  <verse number="28">Or can one walk upon hot coals, And his feet not be scorched?</verse>
  <verse number="29">So he that goeth in to his neighbor’s wife; Whosoever toucheth her shall not be unpunished.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Men do not despise a thief, if he steal To satisfy himself when he is hungry:</verse>
  <verse number="31">But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; He shall give all the substance of his house.</verse>
  <verse number="32">He that committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding: He doeth it who would destroy his own soul.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Wounds and dishonor shall he get; And his reproach shall not be wiped away.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For jealousy is the rage of a man; And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</verse>
  <verse number="35">He will not regard any ransom; Neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</verse>
