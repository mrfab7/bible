<div class="chapter" data-book="Hosea" data-chapter="8" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">SET the trumpet to thy mouth. As an eagle he cometh against the house of the LORD: because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">They shall cry unto me, My God, we Israel know thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Israel hath cast off that which is good: the enemy shall pursue him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He hath cast off thy calf, O Samaria; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For from Israel is even this; the workman made it, and it is no God: yea, the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: he hath no standing corn; the blade shall yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Israel is swallowed up: now are they among the nations as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For they are gone up to Assyria, like a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Yea, though they hire among the nations, now will I gather them; and they begin to be minished by reason of the burden of the king of princes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars to sin, altars have been unto him to sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Though I write for him my law in ten thousand precepts, they are counted as a strange thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">As for the sacrifices of mine offerings, they sacrifice flesh and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not: now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins; they shall return to Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and builded palaces; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the castles thereof.</p>
