  <verse number="1">“My spirit is consumed. My days are extinct, And the grave is ready for me.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Surely there are mockers with me. My eye dwells on their provocation.</verse>
  <verse number="3">“Now give a pledge, be collateral for me with yourself. Who is there who will strike hands with me?</verse>
  <verse number="4">For you have hidden their heart from understanding, Therefore you shall not exalt them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He who denounces his friends for a prey, Even the eyes of his children shall fail.</verse>
  <verse number="6">“But he has made me a byword of the people. They spit in my face.</verse>
  <verse number="7">My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow. All my members are as a shadow.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Upright men shall be astonished at this. The innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Yet shall the righteous hold on his way. He who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But as for you all, come on now again; I shall not find a wise man among you.</verse>
  <verse number="11">My days are past, my plans are broken off, as are the thoughts of my heart.</verse>
  <verse number="12">They change the night into day, saying ‘The light is near’ in the presence of darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If I look for Sheol as my house, if I have spread my couch in the darkness,</verse>
  <verse number="14">If I have said to corruption, ‘You are my father;’ to the worm, ‘My mother,’ and ‘my sister;’</verse>
  <verse number="15">where then is my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?</verse>
  <verse number="16">Shall it go down with me to the gates of Sheol, or descend together into the dust?”</verse>
