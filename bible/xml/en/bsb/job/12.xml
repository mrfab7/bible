  <verse number="1">Then Job answered:</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Truly then you are the people with whom wisdom itself will die!</verse>
  <verse number="3">But I also have a mind; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know such things as these?</verse>
  <verse number="4">I am a laughingstock to my friends, though I called on God, and He answered. The righteous and upright man is a laughingstock.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The one at ease scorns misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The tents of robbers are safe, and those who provoke God are secure—those who carry their god in their hands.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But ask the animals, and they will instruct you; ask the birds of the air, and they will tell you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Or speak to the earth, and it will teach you; let the fish of the sea inform you.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Which of all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this?</verse>
  <verse number="10">The life of every living thing is in His hand, as well as the breath of all mankind.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Does not the ear test words as the tongue tastes its food?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Wisdom is found with the elderly, and understanding comes with long life.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Wisdom and strength belong to God; counsel and understanding are His.</verse>
  <verse number="14">What He tears down cannot be rebuilt; the man He imprisons cannot be released.</verse>
  <verse number="15">If He holds back the waters, they dry up, and if He releases them, they overwhelm the land.</verse>
  <verse number="16">True wisdom and power belong to Him. The deceived and the deceiver are His.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He leads counselors away barefoot and makes fools of judges.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He loosens the bonds placed by kings and fastens a belt around their waists.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He leads priests away barefoot and overthrows the established.</verse>
  <verse number="20">He deprives the trusted of speech and takes away the discernment of elders.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He pours out contempt on nobles and disarms the mighty.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He reveals the deep things of darkness and brings deep shadows into light.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He makes nations great and destroys them; He enlarges nations, then disperses them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He deprives the earth’s leaders of reason and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland.</verse>
  <verse number="25">They grope in the darkness without light; He makes them stagger like drunkards.</verse>
