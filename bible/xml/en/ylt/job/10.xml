<chapter book="Job" number="10" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My soul hath been weary of my life, I leave off my talking to myself, I speak in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I say unto God, ‘Do not condemn me, Let me know why Thou dost strive with me.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Is it good for Thee that Thou dost oppress? That Thou despisest the labour of Thy hands, And on the counsel of the wicked hast shone?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Eyes of flesh hast Thou? As man seeth—seest Thou?</verse>
  <verse number="5">As the days of man are Thy days? Thy years as the days of a man?</verse>
  <verse number="6">That Thou inquirest for mine iniquity, And for my sin seekest?</verse>
  <verse number="7">For Thou knowest that I am not wicked, And there is no deliverer from Thy hand.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thy hands have taken pains about me, And they make me together round about, And Thou swallowest me up!</verse>
  <verse number="9">Remember, I pray Thee, That as clay Thou hast made me, And unto dust Thou dost bring me back.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Dost Thou not as milk pour me out? And as cheese curdle me?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Skin and flesh Thou dost put on me, And with bones and sinews dost fence me.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Life and kindness Thou hast done with me. And Thy inspection hath preserved my spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And these Thou hast laid up in Thy heart, I have known that this is with Thee.</verse>
  <verse number="14">If I sinned, then Thou hast observed me, And from mine iniquity dost not acquit me,</verse>
  <verse number="15">If I have done wickedly—woe to me, And righteously—I lift not up my head, Full of shame—then see my affliction,</verse>
  <verse number="16">And it riseth—as a lion Thou huntest me. And Thou turnest back—Thou shewest Thyself wonderful in me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Thou renewest Thy witnesses against me, And dost multiply Thine anger with me, Changes and warfare are with me.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And why from the womb Hast Thou brought me forth? I expire, and the eye doth not see me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">As I had not been, I am, From the belly to the grave I am brought,</verse>
  <verse number="20">Are not my days few? Cease then, and put from me, And I brighten up a little,</verse>
  <verse number="21">Before I go, and return not, Unto a land of darkness and death-shade,</verse>
  <verse number="22">A land of obscurity as thick darkness, Death-shade—and no order, And the shining is as thick darkness.’</verse>
