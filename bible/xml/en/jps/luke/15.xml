  <verse number="1">Now the tax-gatherers and the notorious sinners were everywhere in the habit of coming close to Him to listen to Him;</verse>
  <verse number="2">and this led the Pharisees and the Scribes indignantly to complain, saying, “He gives a welcome to notorious sinners, and joins them at their meals!”</verse>
  <verse number="3">So in figurative language He asked them,</verse>
  <verse number="4">“Which of you men, if he has a hundred sheep and has lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in their pasture and go in search of the lost one till he finds it?</verse>
  <verse number="5">And when he has found it, he lifts it on his shoulder, glad at heart.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then coming home he calls his friends and neighbours together, and says, ‘Congratulate me, for I have found my sheep—the one I had lost.’</verse>
  <verse number="7">I tell you that in the same way there will be rejoicing in Heaven over one repentant sinner—more rejoicing than over ninety-nine blameless persons who have no need of repentance.</verse>
  <verse number="8">“Or what woman who has ten silver coins, if she loses one of them, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully till she finds it?</verse>
  <verse number="9">And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbours, and says, “’Congratulate me, for I have found the coin which I had lost.’</verse>
  <verse number="10">“I tell you that in the same way there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of God over one repentant sinner.”</verse>
  <verse number="11">He went on to say, “There was a man who had two sons.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The younger of them said to his father, “’Father, give me the share of the property that comes to me.’ “So he divided his wealth between them.</verse>
  <verse number="13">No long time afterwards the younger son got all together and travelled to a distant country, where he wasted his money in debauchery and excess.</verse>
  <verse number="14">At last, when he had spent everything, there came a terrible famine throughout that country, and he began to feel the pinch of want.</verse>
  <verse number="15">So he went and hired himself to one of the inhabitants of that country, who sent him on to his farm to tend swine;</verse>
  <verse number="16">and he longed to make a hearty meal of the pods the swine were eating, but no one gave him any.</verse>
  <verse number="17">“But on coming to himself he said, “’How many of my father’s hired men have more bread than they want, while I here am dying of hunger!</verse>
  <verse number="18">I will rise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against Heaven and before you:</verse>
  <verse number="19">I no longer deserve to be called a son of yours: treat me as one of your hired men.’</verse>
  <verse number="20">“So he rose and came to his father. But while he was still a long way off, his father saw him and pitied him, and ran and threw his arms round his neck and kissed him tenderly.</verse>
  <verse number="21">“’Father,’ cried the son, ‘I have sinned against Heaven and before you: no longer do I deserve to be called a son of yours.’</verse>
  <verse number="22">“But the father said to his servants, “’Fetch a good coat quickly—the best one—and put it on him; and bring a ring for his finger and shoes for his feet.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Fetch the fat calf and kill it, and let us feast and enjoy ourselves;</verse>
  <verse number="24">for my son here was dead and has come to life again: he was lost and has been found.’ “And they began to be merry.</verse>
  <verse number="25">“Now his elder son was out on the farm; and when he returned and came near home, he heard music and dancing.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Then he called one of the lads to him and asked what all this meant.</verse>
  <verse number="27">“’Your brother has come,’ he replied; ‘and your father has had the fat calf killed, because he has got him home safe and sound.’</verse>
  <verse number="28">“Then he was angry and would not go in. But his father came out and entreated him.</verse>
  <verse number="29">“’All these years,’ replied the son, ‘I have been slaving for you, and I have never at any time disobeyed any of your orders, and yet you have never given me so much as a kid, for me to enjoy myself with my friends;</verse>
  <verse number="30">but now that this son of yours is come who has eaten up your property among his bad women, you have killed the fat calf for him.’</verse>
  <verse number="31">“’You my dear son,’ said the father, ‘are always with me, and all that is mine is also yours.</verse>
  <verse number="32">We are bound to make merry and rejoice, for this brother of yours was dead and has come back to life, he was lost and has been found.’”</verse>
