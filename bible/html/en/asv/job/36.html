<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Elihu also proceeded, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Suffer me a little, and I will show thee; For I have yet somewhat to say on Godâ€™s behalf.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For truly my words are not false: One that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: He is mighty in strength of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He preserveth not the life of the wicked, But giveth to the afflicted their right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: But with kings upon the throne He setteth them for ever, and they are exalted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And if they be bound in fetters, And be taken in the cords of afflictions;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then he showeth them their work, And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He openeth also their ear to instruction, And commandeth that they return from iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If they hearken and serve him, They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But they that are godless in heart lay up anger: They cry not for help when he bindeth them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">They die in youth, And their life perisheth among the unclean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He delivereth the afflicted by their affliction, And openeth their ear in oppression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Yea, he would have allured thee out of distress Into a broad place, where there is no straitness; And that which is set on thy table would be full of fatness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But thou art full of the judgment of the wicked: Judgment and justice take hold on thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For let not wrath stir thee up against chastisements; Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Will thy cry avail, that thou be not in distress, Or all the forces of thy strength?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Desire not the night, When peoples are cut off in their place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Take heed, regard not iniquity: For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Behold, God doeth loftily in his power: Who is a teacher like unto him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Who hath enjoined him his way? Or who can say, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Remember that thou magnify his work, Whereof men have sung.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">All men have looked thereon; Man beholdeth it afar off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Behold, God is great, and we know him not; The number of his years is unsearchable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For he draweth up the drops of water, Which distil in rain from his vapor,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Which the skies pour down And drop upon man abundantly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, The thunderings of his pavilion?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Behold, he spreadeth his light around him; And he covereth the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For by these he judgeth the peoples; He giveth food in abundance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He covereth his hands with the lightning, And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The noise thereof telleth concerning him, The cattle also concerning the storm that cometh up.</p>
