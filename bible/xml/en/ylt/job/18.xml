  <verse number="1">And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith:—</verse>
  <verse number="2">When do ye set an end to words? Consider ye, and afterwards do we speak.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Wherefore have we been reckoned as cattle? We have been defiled in your eyes!</verse>
  <verse number="4">(He is tearing himself in his anger.) For thy sake is earth forsaken? And removed is a rock from its place?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Also, the light of the wicked is extinguished. And there doth not shine a spark of his fire.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The light hath been dark in his tent, And his lamp over him is extinguished.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Straitened are the steps of his strength, And cast him down doth his own counsel.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For he is sent into a net by his own feet, And on a snare he doth walk habitually.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Seize on the heel doth a gin, Prevail over him do the designing.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Hidden in the earth is his cord, And his trap on the path.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Round about terrified him have terrors, And they have scattered him—at his feet.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Hungry is his sorrow, And calamity is ready at his side.</verse>
  <verse number="13">It consumeth the parts of his skin, Consume his parts doth death’s first-born.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Drawn from his tent is his confidence, And it causeth him to step to the king of terrors.</verse>
  <verse number="15">It dwelleth in his tent—out of his provender, Scattered over his habitation is sulphur.</verse>
  <verse number="16">From beneath his roots are dried up, And from above cut off is his crop.</verse>
  <verse number="17">His memorial hath perished from the land, And he hath no name on the street.</verse>
  <verse number="18">They thrust him from light unto darkness, And from the habitable earth cast him out.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He hath no continuator, Nor successor among his people, And none is remaining in his dwellings.</verse>
  <verse number="20">At this day westerns have been astonished And easterns have taken fright.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Only these are tabernacles of the perverse, And this the place God hath not known.</verse>
