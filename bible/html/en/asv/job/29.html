<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job again took up his parable, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Oh that I were as in the months of old, As in the days when God watched over me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">When his lamp shined upon my head, And by his light I walked through darkness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">As I was in the ripeness of my days, When the friendship of God was upon my tent;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">When the Almighty was yet with me, And my children were about me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When my steps were washed with butter, And the rock poured me out streams of oil!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When I went forth to the gate unto the city, When I prepared my seat in the street,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The young men saw me and hid themselves, And the aged rose up and stood;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The princes refrained from talking, And laid their hand on their mouth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The voice of the nobels was hushed, And their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me; And when the eye saw me, it gave witness unto me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Because I delivered the poor that cried, The fatherless also, that had none to help him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me; And I caused the widowâ€™s heart to sing for joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: My justice was as a robe and a diadem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I was eyes to the blind, And feet was I to the lame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I was a father to the needy: And the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And I brake the jaws of the unrighteous, And plucked the prey out of his teeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then I said, I shall die in my nest, And I shall multiply my days as the sand:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">My root is spread out to the waters, And the dew lieth all night upon my branch;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My glory is fresh in me, And my bow is renewed in my hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Unto me men gave ear, and waited, And kept silence for my counsel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">After my words they spake not again; And my speech distilled upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And they waited for me as for the rain; And they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">I smiled on them, when they had no confidence; And the light of my countenance they cast not down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">I chose out their way, and sat as chief, And dwelt as a king in the army, As one that comforteth the mourners.</p>
