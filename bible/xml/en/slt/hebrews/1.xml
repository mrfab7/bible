  <verse number="1">God, formerly multifariously and abundantly having spoken to the fathers in the prophets,</verse>
  <verse number="2">At these last days spake to us in the Son, whom he set heir of all things, by whom also he made the times;</verse>
  <verse number="3">Who being the brightness of glory, and the figure of his foundation, and bearing all things by the word of his power, having made by himself the purification of our sins, he sat down on the right hand of the Majesty among the highest ones;</verse>
  <verse number="4">Being so much better than the angels, inasmuch as he has inherited a more distinguished name than they.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For to which of the angels once said he, Thou art my Son, I have this day begotten thee? And again, I will be to him for Father, and he shall be to me for Son?</verse>
  <verse number="6">And when again he should bring in the firstborn to the habitable globe, he says, And let all the angels of God worship him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And truly to the angels of God he says, Who making his angels spirits, and his workmen flames of fire.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And to the Son, Thy throne, O God, for the time of time: a rod of uprightness the rod of thy kingdom.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity; for this God anointed thee, thy God, with the oil of lively joy above thy partakers.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And, Thou, at the beginning, Lord, didst lay the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands:</verse>
  <verse number="11">These shall be destroyed; but thou remainest; and they all as a garment shall grow old;</verse>
  <verse number="12">And as a cloak shalt thou turn them round, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And to which of the angels has he once said, Sit on my right hand, till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Are they not all spirits qualified for service, sent forth for service for them about to inherit salvation?</verse>
