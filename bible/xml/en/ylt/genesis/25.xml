  <verse number="1">And Abraham addeth and taketh a wife, and her name is Keturah;</verse>
  <verse number="2">and she beareth to him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Jokshan hath begotten Sheba and Dedan; and the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and the sons of Midian are Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah: all these are sons of Keturah.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Abraham giveth all that he hath to Isaac;</verse>
  <verse number="6">and to the sons of the concubines whom Abraham hath, Abraham hath given gifts, and sendeth them away from Isaac his son (in his being yet alive) eastward, unto the east country.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And these are the days of the years of the life of Abraham, which he lived, a hundred and seventy and five years;</verse>
  <verse number="8">and Abraham expireth, and dieth in a good old age, aged and satisfied, and is gathered unto his people.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Isaac and Ishmael his sons bury him at the cave of Machpelah, at the field of Ephron, son of Zoar the Hittite, which is before Mamre—</verse>
  <verse number="10">the field which Abraham bought from the sons of Heth—there hath Abraham been buried, and Sarah his wife.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it cometh to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blesseth Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelleth by the Well of the Living One, my Beholder.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And these are births of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, hath borne to Abraham;</verse>
  <verse number="13">and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their births: first-born of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,</verse>
  <verse number="14">and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,</verse>
  <verse number="15">Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:</verse>
  <verse number="16">these are sons of Ishmael, and these their names, by their villages, and by their towers; twelve princes according to their peoples.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years; and he expireth, and dieth, and is gathered unto his people;</verse>
  <verse number="18">and they tabernacle from Havilah unto Shur, which is before Egypt, in thy going towards Asshur; in the presence of all his brethren hath he fallen.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And these are births of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham hath begotten Isaac;</verse>
  <verse number="20">and Isaac is a son of forty years in his taking Rebekah, daughter of Bethuel the Aramaean, from Padan-Aram, sister of Laban the Aramaean, to him for a wife.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Isaac maketh entreaty to Jehovah before his wife, for she is barren: and Jehovah is entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceiveth,</verse>
  <verse number="22">and the children struggle together within her, and she saith, ‘If it is right—why am I thus?’ and she goeth to seek Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Jehovah saith to her, ‘Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples from thy bowels are parted; and the one people than the other people is stronger; and the elder doth serve the younger.’</verse>
  <verse number="24">And her days to bear are fulfilled, and lo, twins are in her womb;</verse>
  <verse number="25">and the first cometh out all red as a hairy robe, and they call his name Esau;</verse>
  <verse number="26">and afterwards hath his brother come out, and his hand is taking hold on Esau’s heel, and one calleth his name Jacob; and Isaac is a son of sixty years in her bearing them.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And the youths grew, and Esau is a man acquainted with hunting, a man of the field; and Jacob is a plain man, inhabiting tents;</verse>
  <verse number="28">and Isaac loveth Esau, for his hunting is in his mouth; and Rebekah is loving Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Jacob boileth pottage, and Esau cometh in from the field, and he is weary;</verse>
  <verse number="30">and Esau saith unto Jacob, ‘Let me eat, I pray thee, some of this red red thing, for I am weary;’ therefore hath one called his name Edom Red;</verse>
  <verse number="31">and Jacob saith, ‘Sell to-day thy birthright to me.’</verse>
  <verse number="32">And Esau saith, ‘Lo, I am going to die, and what is this to me—birthright?’</verse>
  <verse number="33">and Jacob saith, ‘Swear to me to-day:’ and he sweareth to him, and selleth his birthright to Jacob;</verse>
  <verse number="34">and Jacob hath given to Esau bread and pottage of lentiles, and he eateth, and drinketh, and riseth, and goeth; and Esau despiseth the birthright.</verse>
