  <verse number="1">Then said the LORD to me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people: cast them out of my sight, and let them go forth.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And it shall come to pass, if they say to you, Where shall we go forth? then you shall tell them, Thus said the LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I will appoint over them four kinds, said the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And I will cause them to be removed into all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For who shall have pity on you, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan you? or who shall go aside to ask how you do?</verse>
  <verse number="6">You have forsaken me, said the LORD, you are gone backward: therefore will I stretch out my hand against you, and destroy you; I am weary with repenting.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I will bereave them of children, I will destroy my people since they return not from their ways.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Their widows are increased to me above the sand of the seas: I have brought on them against the mother of the young men a spoiler at noonday: I have caused him to fall on it suddenly, and terrors on the city.</verse>
  <verse number="9">She that has borne seven languishes: she has given up the ghost; her sun is gone down while it was yet day: she has been ashamed and confounded: and the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, said the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Woe is me, my mother, that you have borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them does curse me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The LORD said, Truly it shall be well with your remnant; truly I will cause the enemy to entreat you well in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Shall iron break the northern iron and the steel?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Your substance and your treasures will I give to the spoil without price, and that for all your sins, even in all your borders.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And I will make you to pass with your enemies into a land which you know not: for a fire is kindled in my anger, which shall burn on you.</verse>
  <verse number="15">O LORD, you know: remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors; take me not away in your long-suffering: know that for your sake I have suffered rebuke.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Your words were found, and I did eat them; and your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart: for I am called by your name, O LORD God of hosts.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of your hand: for you have filled me with indignation.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable, which refuses to be healed? will you be altogether to me as a liar, and as waters that fail?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Therefore thus said the LORD, If you return, then will I bring you again, and you shall stand before me: and if you take forth the precious from the vile, you shall be as my mouth: let them return to you; but return not you to them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And I will make you to this people a fenced brazen wall: and they shall fight against you, but they shall not prevail against you: for I am with you to save you and to deliver you, said the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And I will deliver you out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem you out of the hand of the terrible.</verse>
