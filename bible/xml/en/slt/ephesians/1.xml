  <verse number="11">In whom also we were cast by lot, determined beforehand according to the purpose of him performing all things according to the counsel of his will:</verse>
  <verse number="12">For us to be to the praise of his glory, who before hoped in Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">In whom ye also, having heard the word of truth, the good news of your salvation: in whom also having believed, ye were sealed by the holy Spirit of solemn promise,</verse>
  <verse number="14">Which is the pledge of our inheritance for the redemption of the acquisition, to the praise of his glory.</verse>

  <verse number="22">And placed all things under his, feet, and gave him head over all things to the church,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Which is his body, the completion of him completing all things in all.</verse>
