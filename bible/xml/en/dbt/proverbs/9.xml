  <verse number="3">she hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the summits of the high places of the city,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither. To him that is void of understanding, she saith,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Come, eat ye of my bread, and drink of the wine that I have mingled.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Forsake follies and live, and go in the way of intelligence.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He that instructeth a scorner getteth to himself shame; and he that reproveth a wicked [man] [getteth] to himself a blot.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee; reprove a wise [man], and he will love thee.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Impart to a wise [man], and he will become yet wiser; teach a righteous [man], and he will increase learning.</verse>

  <verse number="15">to call passers-by who go right on their ways:</verse>
  <verse number="16">Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither. And to him that is void of understanding she saith,</verse>
  <verse number="17">Stolen waters are sweet, and the bread of secrecy is pleasant.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But he knoweth not that the dead are there; [that] her guests are in the depths of Sheol.</verse>
