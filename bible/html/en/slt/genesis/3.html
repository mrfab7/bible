<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the serpent was crafty above every beast of the field which Jehovah God made; and he will say to the woman, Is it because God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the woman will say to the serpent, From the fruit of the tree of the garden we shall eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And from the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God said, Ye shall not eat from it, and ye shall not touch upon it, lest ye shall die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the serpent will say to the woman, Dying ye shall not die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For God is knowing in the day of your eating from it, and your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the woman will see that the tree is good for food, and that it is a desire to the eyes, and a tree desired to make wise; and she will take from its fruit and will eat, and will give also to her man with her, and he will eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the eyes of the two shall be opened, and they shall know that they are naked; and they shall sew together the leaves of the fig tree, and shall make to themselves girdles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And they shall hear the voice of Jehovah God walking in the garden at the breeze of the day: and Adam and his wife will hide from the face of Jehovah God in the midst of the wood of the garden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Jehovah God will call to the man, and will say to him, Where art thou?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he will will say, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I shall be afraid, because I am naked, and I will hide myself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And he will say, Who showed to thee that thou art naked? Of the tree which I charged thee not to eat, didst thou eat from it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the man will say, The woman which thou gavest with me, she gave to me from the tree, and I shall eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Jehovah God will say to the woman, What is this thou didst? And the woman will say, The serpent deceived me and I shall eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Jehovah God will say to the serpent, Because thou didst this, cursed art thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust thou shalt eat all the days of thy life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And I will put enmity between thee and between the woman, and between thy seed and between her seed; it shall lie in wait for thee as to the head, and thou shalt lie in wait for him as to the heel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">To the woman he said, Multiplying, I will multiply thy pain and thy conception; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and to thy husband thy desire, and he shall rule over thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And to Adam he said, Because thou didst listen to the voice of thy wife, and thou wilt eat from the tree which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat from it; cursed the earth for thy sake; in labor shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And thorns and weeds shall it cause to sprout forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the green herb of the field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">In the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat food until thy turning back to the earth; for out of it thou wert taken; for dust thou art, and to dust shalt thou turn back.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Adam will call his wifeâ€™s name Life, for she was the mother of all living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Jehovah God will make to Adam and to his wife, coats of skin, and will clothe them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Jehovah God will say, Lo, Adam became as one from us, to know good and evil: and now lest he shall send forth his hand and take also of the tree of lives, and eat, and live to eternity:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Jehovah God will send him forth from the garden of Eden to work the earth which he was taken from there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And he will drive out Adam; and he will set up from the east of the garden of Eden, cherubims, and a flaming sword, turning itself about to keep the way of the tree of lives.</p>
