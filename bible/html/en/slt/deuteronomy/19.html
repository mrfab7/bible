<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When Jehovah thy God shall cut off the nations which Jehovah thy God gave to thee their land, and thou didst possess and dwell in their cities, and in their houses;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Three cities shalt thou separate to thee in the midst of thy land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee to possess it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thou shalt prepare to thee the way, and divide into three parts the boundary of thy land which Jehovah thy God causes thee to inherit; and it was for every slayer to flee there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And this the word of the slayer which shall flee there, and he lived: whoever shall strike his friend, not knowing, and he hated him not from yesterday the third day;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And who shall go with his friend into the forest to cut wood, and his hand thrust out with the axe to out down the tree, and the iron slipped from the wood and found his friend, and he died; he shall flee to one of these cities, and he lived:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Lest the nearest relative of blood shall pursue after the slayer when his heart shall be warm, and overtaking him, for the way shall be great, and he smote him in soul; and to him not the judgment of death for he hated him not from yesterday the third day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For this I command thee, saying, Three cities thou shalt separate to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And if Jehovah thy God shall enlarge thy bound as he sware to thy fathers, and give to thee all the land which he spake to give to thy fathers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">If thou shalt watch all this command to do it, which I command thee this day, to love Jehovah thy God and to go in his ways all the days; and thou shalt add to thee yet three cities upon these three.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And innocent blood shall not be poured out in the midst of thy land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee an inheritance, and bloods were upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And if there shall be a man hating his friend and lying in wait for him, and he rose up against him and smote him in soul, and he died, and he fled to one of these cities:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the old men of his city sent and took him from there and gave him into the hand of the nearest relative of blood, and he died.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Thine eye shall not pity him and put away innocent blood from Israel, and it was well to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thou shalt not remove the boundary of thy neighbor which they at first set bounds in thine inheritance which thou shalt inherit in the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee to inherit it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, and for any sin, in any sin which he shall sin; by the mouth of two witnesses or by the mouth of three witnesses the word shall be established.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If a witness of wrong shall rise up against a man to testify apostasy against him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the two men to whom is the contention stood before Jehovah, before the priests and the judges who shall be in those days;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the judges sought out diligently; and behold, a witness of falsehood, the witness of falsehood testified against his brother;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And ye did to him as he purposed to do to his brother: and put away evil from the midst of thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And they remaining shall hear, and fear, and shall no more add to do according to this evil word in the midst of thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And thine eye shall not pity; soul for soul, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, and foot for foot.</p>
