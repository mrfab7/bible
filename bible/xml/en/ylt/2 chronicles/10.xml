  <verse number="1">And Rehoboam goeth to Shechem, for to Shechem have all Israel come to cause him to reign.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And it cometh to pass, at Jeroboam son of Nebat’s—who is in Egypt because he hath fled from the face of Solomon the king—hearing, that Jeroboam turneth back out of Egypt;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and they send and call for him, and Jeroboam cometh in, and all Israel, and speak unto Rehoboam, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thy father made our yoke sharp, and now, make light somewhat of the sharp service of thy father, and of his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we serve thee.’</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he saith unto them, ‘Yet three days—then return ye unto me;’ and the people go.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And king Rehoboam consulteth with the aged men who have been standing before Solomon his father in his being alive, saying, ‘How are ye counselling to answer this people?’</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they speak unto him, saying, ‘If thou dost become good to this people, and hast been pleased with them, and spoken unto them good words, then they have been to thee servants all the days.’</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he forsaketh the counsel of the aged men that they counselled him, and consulteth with the lads who have grown up with him, those standing before him,</verse>
  <verse number="9">and he saith unto them, ‘What are ye counselling, and we answer this people that have spoken unto me, saying, Make light somewhat of the yoke that thy father put upon us?’</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the lads who have grown up with him, speak with him, saying, ‘Thus dost thou say to the people who have spoken unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, and thou, make light somewhat of our yoke; thus dost thou say unto them, My little finger is thicker than the loins of my father;</verse>
  <verse number="11">and now, my father laid on you a heavy yoke, and I—I add unto your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, and I—with scorpions.’</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Jeroboam cometh in, and all the people, unto Rehoboam on the third day, as the king spake, saying, ‘Return unto me on the third day.’</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the king answereth them sharply, and king Rehoboam forsaketh the counsel of the aged men,</verse>
  <verse number="14">and speaketh unto them according to the counsel of the lads, saying, ‘My father made your yoke heavy, and I—I add unto it; my father chastised you with whips, and I—with scorpions.’</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the king hath not hearkened unto the people, for the revolution hath been from God, for the sake of Jehovah’s establishing His word that He spake by the hand of Abijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam son of Nebat.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And all Israel have seen that the king hath not hearkened to them, and the people send back to the king, saying, ‘What portion have we in David? yea, there is no inheritance in a son of Jesse; each to thy tents, O Israel; now, see thy house—David,’ and all Israel go to their tents.</verse>
  <verse number="17">As to the sons of Israel who are dwelling in the cities of Judah—Rehoboam reigneth over them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And king Rehoboam sendeth Hadoram, who is over the tribute, and the sons of Israel cast at him stones, and he dieth; and king Rehoboam hath strengthened himself to go up into a chariot to flee to Jerusalem;</verse>
  <verse number="19">and Israel transgress against the house of David unto this day.</verse>
