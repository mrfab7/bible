<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, attend to my wisdom; incline thine ear to understanding:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">To watch meditation, and thy lips shall guard knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the lips of the strange woman will drop droppings of the honeycomb, and her palate is smooth above oil:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And her latter state being bitter as wormwood; sharp as a two-mouthed sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps will hold fast to hades.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Lest thou shalt make level the path of life, her tracks wavered; thou wilt not know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And now, ye sons, hear to me, and ye shall not depart from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Remove far off from her thy way, and thou shalt not draw near to the door of her house:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Lest thou shalt give thy strength to others, and thy years to the cruel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Lest strangers shall be filled with thy strength, and thy labors in the house of strangers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And thou didst lament in thy latter state, in the consuming of thy flesh and thy fulness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And thou saidst, How did I hate instruction, and my heart despise reproofs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And I heard not to the voice of him teaching me, and I inclined not mine ear to him instructing me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">As I was almost in all evil in the midst of the convocation and the assembly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Drink water from thy pit, and flowing from the midst of thy well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Thy fountains shall be dispersed without; in the broad places streams of waters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">They shall be to thee alone, and not strangers with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Thy fountain shall be blessed: and rejoice from the wife of thy youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The hind of loves and the wild goat of grace; her breasts shall satiate thee in all time; thou shalt always wander in her loves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And wherefore, my son, wilt thou wander with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For before the eyes of Jehovah are the ways of man, and he makes level all his tracks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">His iniquities shall take the unjust one, and with the cords of his sins shall he be held fast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He shall die in not being instructed, and he shall wander in the multitude of his folly.</p>
