<p class="verse" data-verse="1">These are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and of the sons who were born to them after the great flood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The sons of Japheth were Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And then the sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the sons of Javan were Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Rodanim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The islands of the Gentiles were divided by these into their regions, each one according to his tongue, and their families in their nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the Sons of Ham were Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the sons of Cush were Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca. The sons of Raamah were Sheba and Dadan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And then Cush conceived Nimrod; he began to be powerful on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he was an able hunter before the Lord. From this, a proverb came forth: ‘Just like Nimrod, an able hunter before the Lord.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And so, the beginning of his kingdom was Babylon, and Erech, and Accad, and Chalanne, in the land of Shinar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">From that land, Assur came forth, and he built Nineveh, and the streets of the city, and Calah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">and also Resen, between Nineveh and Calah. This is a great city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And truly, Mizraim conceived Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, Naphtuhim,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and Pathrusim, and Casluhim, from whom came forth the Philistines and the Caphtorim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Then Canaan conceived Sidon his firstborn, the Hittite,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, the Girgashite,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">the Hivite, and the Arkite: the Sinite,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">and the Arvadian, the Samarite, and the Hamathite. And after this, the peoples of the Canaanites became widespread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the borders of Chanaan went, as one travels, from Sidon to Gerar, even to Gaza, until one enters Sodom and Gomorrah, and from Admah and Zeboiim, even to Lesa.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">These are the sons of Ham in their kindred, and tongues, and generations, and lands, and nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Likewise, from Shem, the father of all the sons of Heber, the elder brother of Japheth, sons were born.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The sons of Shem were Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The sons of Aram were Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But truly, Arphaxad conceived Shelah, from whom was born Eber.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And to Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth became divided, and his brother’s name was Joktan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">This Joktan conceived Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, Jerah</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">and Hadoram, and Uzal and Diklah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">and Obal and Abimael, Sheba</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">and Ophir, and Havilah and Jobab. All these were the sons of Joktan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And their habitation extended from Messa, as one sojourns, even to Sephar, a mountain in the east.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">These are the sons of Shem according to their kindred, and tongues, and the regions within their nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">These are the families of Noah, according to their peoples and nations. The nations became divided according to these, on the earth after the great flood.</p>
