<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Honor thy father and mother (which is the first commandment with promise)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Not with eye-service, as men-pleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Knowing that whatever good thing any man doeth, the same will he receive from the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And, ye masters, do the same things to them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Wherefore take to you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breast-plate of righteousness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Above all, taking the shield of faith, with which ye will be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching for this purpose with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And for me, that utterance may be given to me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For which I am an embassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, will make known to you all things:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Whom I have sent to you for the same purpose, that ye may know our affairs, and that he may comfort your hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.</p>
