<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="10" translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" translationID="jps" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">For I would have you remember, brethren, how our forefathers were all of them sheltered by the cloud, and all got safely through the Red Sea.</verse>
  <verse number="2">All were baptized in the cloud and in the sea to be followers of Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="3">All ate the same spiritual food,</verse>
  <verse number="4">and all drank the same spiritual drink; for they long drank the water that flowed from the spiritual rock that went with them—and that rock was the Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But with most of them God was not well pleased; for they were laid low in the Desert.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And in this they became a warning to us, to teach us not to be eager, as they were eager, in pursuit of what is evil.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And you must not be worshippers of idols, as some of them were. For it is written, “The People sat down to eat and drink, and stood up to dance.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">Nor may we be fornicators, like some of them who committed fornication and on a single day 23,000 of them fell dead.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And do not let us test the Lord too far, as some of them tested Him and were destroyed by the serpents.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And do not be discontented, as some of them were, and they were destroyed by the Destroyer.</verse>
  <verse number="11">All this kept happening to them with a figurative meaning; but it was put on record by way of admonition to us upon whom the ends of the Ages have come.</verse>
  <verse number="12">So then let him who thinks he is standing securely beware of falling.</verse>
  <verse number="13">No temptation has you in its power but such as is common to human nature; and God is faithful and will not allow you to be tempted beyond your strength. But, when the temptation comes, He will also provide the way of escape; so that you may be able to bear it.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Therefore, my dear friends, avoid all connection with the worship of idols.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I speak as to men of sense: judge for yourselves of what I say.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The cup of blessing, which we bless, does it not mean a joint-participation in the blood of Christ? The loaf of bread which we break, does it not mean a joint-participation in the body of Christ?</verse>
  <verse number="17">Since there is one loaf, we who are many are one body; we, all of us, share in that one loaf.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Look at the Israelites—the nation and their ritual. Are not those who eat the sacrifices joint-partakers in the altar?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Do I mean that a thing sacrificed to an idol is what it claims to be, or that an idol is a real thing?</verse>
  <verse number="20">No, but that which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, not to God; and I would not have you have fellowship with one another through the demons.</verse>
  <verse number="21">You cannot drink the Lord’s cup and the cup of demons: you cannot be joint-partakers both in the table of the Lord and in the table of demons.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Or are we actually arousing the Lord to jealousy. Are we stronger than He is?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Everything is allowable, but not everything is profitable. Everything is allowable, but everything does not build others up.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Let no one be for ever seeking his own good, but let each seek that of his fellow man.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Anything that is for sale in the meat market, eat, and ask no questions for conscience’ sake;</verse>
  <verse number="26">for the earth is the Lord’s, and all that it contains.</verse>
  <verse number="27">If an unbeliever gives you an invitation and you are disposed to accept it, eat whatever is put before you, and ask no questions for conscience’ sake.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But if any one tells you, “This food has been offered in sacrifice;” abstain from eating it—out of respect for him who warned you, and, as before, for conscience’ sake.</verse>
  <verse number="29">But now I mean his conscience, not your own. “Why, on what ground,” you may object, “is the question of my liberty of action to be decided by a conscience not my own?</verse>
  <verse number="30">If, so far as I am concerned, I partake with a grateful heart, why am I to be found fault with in regard to a thing for which I give thanks?”</verse>
  <verse number="31">Whether, then, you are eating or drinking, or whatever you are doing, let everything be done to the glory of God.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Do not be causes of stumbling either to Jews or to Gentiles, nor to the Church of God.</verse>
  <verse number="33">That is the way that I also seek in everything the approval of all men, not aiming at my own profit, but at that of the many, in the hope that they may be saved.</verse>
