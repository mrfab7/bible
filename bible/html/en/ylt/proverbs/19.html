<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Better is the poor walking in his integrity, Than the perverse in his lips, who is a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Also, without knowledge the soul is not good, And the hasty in feet is sinning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The folly of man perverteth his way, And against Jehovah is his heart wroth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Wealth addeth many friends, And the poor from his neighbour is separated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A false witness is not acquitted, Whoso breatheth out lies is not delivered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Many entreat the face of the noble, And all have made friendship to a man of gifts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All the brethren of the poor have hated him, Surely also his friends have been far from him, He is pursuing words—they are not!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Whoso is getting heart is loving his soul, He is keeping understanding to find good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A false witness is not acquitted, And whoso breatheth out lies perisheth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Luxury is not comely for a fool, Much less for a servant to rule among princes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The wisdom of a man hath deferred his anger, And his glory is to pass over transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The wrath of a king is a growl as of a young lion, And as dew on the herb his good-will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A calamity to his father is a foolish son, And the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">House and wealth are the inheritance of fathers, And from Jehovah is an understanding wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Sloth causeth deep sleep to fall, And an indolent soul doth hunger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Whoso is keeping the command is keeping his soul, Whoso is despising His ways dieth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Whoso is lending to Jehovah is favouring the poor, And his deed He repayeth to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Chastise thy son, for there is hope, And to put him to death lift not up thy soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A man of great wrath is bearing punishment, For, if thou dost deliver, yet again thou dost add.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Hear counsel and receive instruction, So that thou art wise in thy latter end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Many are the purposes in a man’s heart, And the counsel of Jehovah it standeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The desirableness of a man is his kindness, And better is the poor than a liar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The fear of Jehovah is to life, And satisfied he remaineth—he is not charged with evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The slothful hath hidden his hand in a dish, Even unto his mouth he bringeth it not back.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">A scorner smite, and the simple acts prudently, And give reproof to the intelligent, He understandeth knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Whoso is spoiling a father causeth a mother to flee, A son causing shame, and bringing confusion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Cease, my son, to hear instruction—To err from sayings of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A worthless witness scorneth judgment, And the mouth of the wicked swalloweth iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Judgments have been prepared for scorners, And stripes for the back of fools!</p>
