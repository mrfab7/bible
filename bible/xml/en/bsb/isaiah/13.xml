<chapter book="Isaiah" number="13" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">This is the burden against Babylon that Isaiah son of Amoz received:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Raise a banner on a barren hilltop; call aloud to them. Wave your hand, that they may enter the gates of the nobles.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I have commanded My sanctified ones; I have even summoned My warriors to execute My wrath and exult in My triumph.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Listen, a tumult on the mountains, like that of a great multitude! Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms, like nations gathered together! The LORD of Hosts is mobilizing an army for war.</verse>
  <verse number="5">They are coming from faraway lands, from the ends of the heavens—the LORD and the weapons of His wrath—to destroy the whole country.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Wail, for the Day of the LORD is near; it will come as destruction from the Almighty.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore all hands will fall limp, and every man’s heart will melt.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Terror, pain, and anguish will seize them; they will writhe like a woman in labor. They will look at one another, their faces flushed with fear.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Behold, the Day of the LORD is coming—cruel, with fury and burning anger—to make the earth a desolation and to destroy the sinners within it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For the stars of heaven and their constellations will not give their light. The rising sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I will punish the world for its evil and the wicked for their iniquity. I will end the haughtiness of the arrogant and lay low the pride of the ruthless.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I will make man scarcer than pure gold, and mankind rarer than the gold of Ophir.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will be shaken from its place at the wrath of the LORD of Hosts on the day of His burning anger.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Like a hunted gazelle, like a sheep without a shepherd, each will return to his own people, each will flee to his native land.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Whoever is caught will be stabbed, and whoever is captured will die by the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes, their houses will be looted, and their wives will be ravished.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Behold, I will stir up against them the Medes, who have no regard for silver and no desire for gold.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Their bows will dash young men to pieces; they will have no mercy on the fruit of the womb; they will not look with pity on the children.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Babylon, the jewel of the kingdoms, the glory of the pride of the Chaldeans, will be overthrown by God like Sodom and Gomorrah.</verse>
  <verse number="20">She will never be inhabited or settled from generation to generation; no nomad will pitch his tent there, no shepherd will rest his flock there.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But desert creatures will lie down there, and howling creatures will fill her houses. Ostriches will dwell there, and wild goats will leap about.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Hyenas will howl in her fortresses and jackals in her luxurious palaces. Babylon’s time is at hand, and her days will not be prolonged.</verse>
