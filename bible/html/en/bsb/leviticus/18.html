<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then the LORD said to Moses,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">You must not follow the practices of the land of Egypt, where you used to live, and you must not follow the practices of the land of Canaan, into which I am bringing you. You must not walk in their customs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">You are to practice My judgments and keep My statutes by walking in them. I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Keep My statutes and My judgments, for the man who does these things will live by them. I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">None of you are to approach any close relative to have sexual relations. I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">You must not expose the nakedness of your father by having sexual relations with your mother. She is your mother; you must not have sexual relations with her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">You must not have sexual relations with your father’s wife; it would dishonor your father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">You must not have sexual relations with your sister, either your father’s daughter or your mother’s daughter, whether she was born in the same home or elsewhere.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">You must not have sexual relations with your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter, for that would shame your family.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">You must not have sexual relations with the daughter of your father’s wife, born to your father; she is your sister.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">You must not have sexual relations with your father’s sister; she is your father’s close relative.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">You must not have sexual relations with your mother’s sister, for she is your mother’s close relative.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">You must not dishonor your father’s brother by approaching his wife to have sexual relations with her; she is your aunt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">You must not have sexual relations with your daughter-in-law. She is your son’s wife; you are not to have sexual relations with her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">You must not have sexual relations with your brother’s wife; that would shame your brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">You must not have sexual relations with both a woman and her daughter. You are not to marry her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter and have sexual relations with her. They are close relatives; it is depraved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">You must not take your wife’s sister as a rival wife and have sexual relations with her while your wife is still alive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">You must not approach a woman to have sexual relations with her during her menstrual period.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">You must not lie carnally with your neighbor’s wife and thus defile yourself with her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">You must not give any of your children to be sacrificed to Molech, for you must not profane the name of your God. I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">You must not lie with a man as with a woman; that is an abomination.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">You must not lie carnally with any animal, thus defiling yourself with it; a woman must not stand before an animal to mate with it; that is a perversion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Do not defile yourselves by any of these practices, for by all these things the nations I am driving out before you have defiled themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Even the land has become defiled, so I am punishing it for its sin, and the land will vomit out its inhabitants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But you are to keep My statutes and ordinances, and you must not commit any of these abominations—neither your native-born nor the foreigner who lives among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For the men who were in the land before you committed all these abominations, and the land has become defiled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">So if you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it spewed out the nations before you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Therefore anyone who commits any of these abominations must be cut off from among his people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">You must keep My charge not to practice any of the abominable customs that were practiced before you, so that you do not defile yourselves by them. I am the LORD your God.”</p>
