  <verse number="1">For Zion’s sake will I not hold My peace, And for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, Until her triumph go forth as brightness, And her salvation as a torch that burneth.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the nations shall see thy triumph, And all kings thy glory; And thou shalt be called by a new name, Which the mouth of the LORD shall mark out.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thou shalt also be a crown of beauty in the hand of the LORD, And a royal diadem in the open hand of thy God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken, Neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate; But thou shalt be called, My delight is in her, And thy land, Espoused; For the LORD delighteth in thee, And thy land shall be espoused.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For as a young man espouseth a virgin, So shall thy sons espouse thee; And as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, So shall thy God rejoice over thee.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I have set watchmen Upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, They shall never hold their peace Day nor night: ‘Ye that are the LORD’S remembrancers, Take ye no rest,</verse>
  <verse number="7">And give Him no rest, Till He establish, And till He make Jerusalem A praise in the earth.’</verse>
  <verse number="8">The LORD hath sworn by His right hand, And by the arm of His strength: Surely I will no more give thy corn To be food for thine enemies; And strangers shall not drink thy wine, For which thou hast laboured;</verse>
  <verse number="9">But they that have garnered it shall eat it, And praise the LORD, And they that have gathered it shall drink it In the courts of My sanctuary.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Go through, go through the gates, Clear ye the way of the people; Cast up, cast up the highway, Gather out the stones; Lift up an ensign over the peoples.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed Unto the end of the earth: Say ye to the daughter of Zion: ‘Behold, thy salvation cometh; Behold, His reward is with Him, And His recompense before Him.’</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they shall call them The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD; And thou shalt be called Sought out, A city not forsaken.</verse>
