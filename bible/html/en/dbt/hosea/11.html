<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto the Baals, and burned incense to graven images.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I it was that taught Ephraim to walk,—He took them upon his arms,—but they knew not that I healed them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I drew them with bands of a man, with cords of love; and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I gently caused them to eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king; for they refused to return [to me];</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and the sword shall turn about in his cities, and shall consume his bars, and devour [them], because of their own counsels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Yea, my people are bent upon backsliding from me: though they call them to the Most High, none at all exalteth [him].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">How shall I give thee over, Ephraim? [how] shall I deliver thee up, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? [how] shall I set thee as Zeboim? My heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not again destroy Ephraim; for I am God, and not man,—the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not come in anger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They shall walk after Jehovah; he shall roar like a lion; when he shall roar, then the children shall hasten from the west:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">they shall hasten as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will cause them to dwell in their houses, saith Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Ephraim encompasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah yet walketh with God, and with the holy things of truth.</p>
