<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="11" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Be my imitators, even as I also [am] of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Now I praise you, that in all things ye are mindful of me; and that as I have directed you, ye keep the directions.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But I wish you to know that the Christ is the head of every man, but woman’s head [is] the man, and the Christ’s head God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Every man praying or prophesying, having [anything] on his head, puts his head to shame.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered puts her own head to shame; for it is one and the same as a shaved [woman].</verse>
  <verse number="6">For if a woman be not covered, let her hair also be cut off. But if [it be] shameful to a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For man indeed ought not to have his head covered, being God’s image and glory; but woman is man’s glory.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For man is not of woman, but woman of man.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore ought the woman to have authority on her head, on account of the angels.</verse>
  <verse number="11">However, neither [is] woman without man, nor man without woman, in [the] Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For as the woman [is] of the man, so also [is] the man by the woman, but all things of God.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman should pray to God uncovered?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Does not even nature itself teach you, that man, if he have long hair, it is a dishonour to him?</verse>
  <verse number="15">But woman, if she have long hair, [it is] glory to her; for the long hair is given [to her] in lieu of a veil.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But if any one think to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the assemblies of God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But [in] prescribing [to you on] this [which I now enter on], I do not praise, [namely,] that ye come together, not for the better, but for the worse.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For first, when ye come together in assembly, I hear there exist divisions among you, and I partly give credit [to it].</verse>
  <verse number="19">For there must also be sects among you, that the approved may become manifest among you.</verse>
  <verse number="20">When ye come therefore together into one place, it is not to eat [the] Lord’s supper.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For each one in eating takes his own supper before [others], and one is hungry and another drinks to excess.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Have ye not then houses for eating and drinking? or do ye despise the assembly of God, and put to shame them who have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this [point] I do not praise.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For I received from the Lord, that which I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus, in the night in which he was delivered up, took bread,</verse>
  <verse number="24">and having given thanks broke [it], and said, This is my body, which [is] for you: this do in remembrance of me.</verse>
  <verse number="25">In like manner also the cup, after having supped, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye shall drink [it], in remembrance of me.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For as often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye announce the death of the Lord, until he come.</verse>
  <verse number="27">So that whosoever shall eat the bread, or drink the cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty in respect of the body and of the blood of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But let a man prove himself, and thus eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For [the] eater and drinker eats and drinks judgment to himself, not distinguishing the body.</verse>
  <verse number="30">On this account many among you [are] weak and infirm, and a good many are fallen asleep.</verse>
  <verse number="31">But if we judged ourselves, so were we not judged.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But being judged, we are disciplined of [the] Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.</verse>
  <verse number="33">So that, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait for one another.</verse>
  <verse number="34">If any one be hungry, let him eat at home, that ye may not come together for judgment. But the other things, whenever I come, I will set in order.</verse>
