<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Timothy" data-chapter="4" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If you put the brothers in remembrance of these things, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto you have attained.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But refuse profane and old wivesâ€™ fables, and exercise yourself rather to godliness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For bodily exercise profits little: but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For therefore we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, specially of those that believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">These things command and teach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let no man despise your youth; but be you an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Neglect not the gift that is in you, which was given you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Meditate on these things; give yourself wholly to them; that your profiting may appear to all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Take heed to yourself, and to the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this you shall both save yourself, and them that hear you.</p>
