  <verse number="3">I to my beloved, and my beloved to me, who feedeth among the lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thou art beautiful, O my love, sweet and comely as Jerusalem: terrible as an army set in array.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Turn away thy eyes from me, for they have made me flee away. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from Galaad.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Thy teeth as a flock of sheep, which come up from the washing, all with twins, and there is none barren among them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thy cheeks are as the bark of a pomegranate, beside what is hidden within thee.</verse>
  <verse number="8">There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and young maidens without number.</verse>

  <verse number="13">Return, return, O Sulamitess : return, return that we may behold thee.</verse>
