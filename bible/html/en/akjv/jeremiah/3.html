<p class="verse" data-verse="1">They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man’s, shall he return to her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but you have played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, said the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Lift up your eyes to the high places, and see where you have not been lien with. In the ways have you sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and you have polluted the land with your prostitutions and with your wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; and you had a whore’s forehead, you refused to be ashamed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Will you not from this time cry to me, My father, you are the guide of my youth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, you have spoken and done evil things as you could.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The LORD said also to me in the days of Josiah the king, Have you seen that which backsliding Israel has done? she is gone up on every high mountain and under every green tree, and there has played the harlot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I said after she had done all these things, Turn you to me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And it came to pass through the lightness of her prostitution, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah has not turned to me with her whole heart, but feignedly, said the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the LORD said to me, The backsliding Israel has justified herself more than treacherous Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, you backsliding Israel, said the LORD; and I will not cause my anger to fall on you: for I am merciful, said the LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have transgressed against the LORD your God, and have scattered your ways to the strangers under every green tree, and you have not obeyed my voice, said the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Turn, O backsliding children, said the LORD; for I am married to you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And I will give you pastors according to my heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And it shall come to pass, when you be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, said the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered to it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance to your fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But I said, How shall I put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, You shall call me, My father; and shall not turn away from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Surely as a wife treacherously departs from her husband, so have you dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, said the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">A voice was heard on the high places, weeping and supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten the LORD their God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Return, you backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come to you; for you are the LORD our God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For shame has devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covers us: for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God.</p>
