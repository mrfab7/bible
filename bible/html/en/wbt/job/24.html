<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Why, seeing times are not hid from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widowâ€™s ox for a pledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Behold, as wild asses in the desert, they go forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Who make oil within their walls, and tread their wine-presses, and suffer thirst.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not its ways, nor abide in its paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the day-time: they know not the light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the morning is to them even as the shades of death: if one knoweth them, they are in the terrors of the shades of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Drouth and heat consume the snow-waters: so doth the grave those who have sinned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He oppresseth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Though it is given him to be in safety, on which he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all others, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And if it is not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech of no worth?</p>
