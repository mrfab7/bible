<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Ye are all children of light, and children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that are drunken, are drunken in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breast-plate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Wherefore, comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And we beseech you, brethren, to know them who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And to esteem them very highly in love for their workâ€™s sake. And be at peace among yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are disorderly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak, be patient towards all men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">See that none render evil for evil to any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Rejoice evermore.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Pray without ceasing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Quench not the spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Despise not prophesyings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Abstain from all appearance of evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body may be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Brethren, pray for us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</p>
