  <verse number="1">He that dasheth in pieces is come up against thee: keep the fortress, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For Jehovah restoreth the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel; for the emptiers have emptied them out, and destroyed their vine-branches.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots flash with steel in the day of his preparation, and the cypress spears are brandished.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The chariots rage in the streets; they rush to and fro in the broad ways: the appearance of them is like torches; they run like the lightnings.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He remembereth his nobles: they stumble in their march; they make haste to the wall thereof, and the mantelet is prepared.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace is dissolved.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And it is decreed: she is uncovered, she is carried away; and her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves, beating upon their breasts.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But Nineveh hath been from of old like a pool of water: yet they flee away. Stand, stand, they cry; but none looketh back.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold; for there is no end of the store, the glory of all goodly furniture.</verse>
  <verse number="10">She is empty, and void, and waste; and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and anguish is in all loins, and the faces of them all are waxed pale.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Where is the den of the lions, and the feeding-place of the young lions, where the lion and the lioness walked, the lion’s whelp, and none made them afraid?</verse>
  <verse number="12">The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his caves with prey, and his dens with ravin.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions; and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.</verse>
