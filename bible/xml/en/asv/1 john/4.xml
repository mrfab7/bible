<chapter book="1 John" number="4" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:</verse>
  <verse number="3">and every spirit that confesseth not Jesus is not of God: and this is the spirit of the antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it cometh; and now it is in the world already.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Ye are of God, my little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.</verse>
  <verse number="5">They are of the world: therefore speak they as of the world, and the world heareth them.</verse>
  <verse number="6">We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he who is not of God heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is begotten of God, and knoweth God.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Herein was the love of God manifested in us, that God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</verse>
  <verse number="12">No man hath beheld God at any time: if we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us:</verse>
  <verse number="13">hereby we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And we have beheld and bear witness that the Father hath sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And we know and have believed the love which God hath in us. God is love; and he that abideth in love abideth in God, and God abideth in him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Herein is love made perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, even so are we in this world.</verse>
  <verse number="18">There is no fear in love: but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath punishment; and he that feareth is not made perfect in love.</verse>
  <verse number="19">We love, because he first loved us.</verse>
  <verse number="20">If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, cannot love God whom he hath not seen.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother also.</verse>
