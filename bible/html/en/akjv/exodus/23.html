<div class="chapter" data-book="Exodus" data-chapter="23" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">You shall not raise a false report: put not your hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">You shall not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shall you speak in a cause to decline after many to wrest judgment:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Neither shall you countenance a poor man in his cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If you meet your enemy’s ox or his ass going astray, you shall surely bring it back to him again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If you see the ass of him that hates you lying under his burden, and would forbear to help him, you shall surely help with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">You shall not wrest the judgment of your poor in his cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Keep you far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay you not: for I will not justify the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And you shall take no gift: for the gift blinds the wise, and perverts the words of the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Also you shall not oppress a stranger: for you know the heart of a stranger, seeing you were strangers in the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And six years you shall sow your land, and shall gather in the fruits thereof:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie still; that the poor of your people may eat: and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner you shall deal with your vineyard, and with your olive grove.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest: that your ox and your ass may rest, and the son of your handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And in all things that I have said to you be circumspect: and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of your mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Three times you shall keep a feast to me in the year.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread: (you shall eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded you, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it you came out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the feast of harvest, the first fruits of your labors, which you have sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when you have gathered in your labors out of the field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Three items in the year all your males shall appear before the LORD God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The first of the first fruits of your land you shall bring into the house of the LORD your God. You shall not seethe a kid in his mother’s milk.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Behold, I send an Angel before you, to keep you in the way, and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my name is in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But if you shall indeed obey his voice, and do all that I speak; then I will be an enemy to your enemies, and an adversary to your adversaries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For my Angel shall go before you, and bring you in to the Amorites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites: and I will cut them off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but you shall utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And you shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless your bread, and your water; and I will take sickness away from the middle of you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in your land: the number of your days I will fulfill.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">I will send my fear before you, and will destroy all the people to whom you shall come, and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And I will send hornets before you, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">I will not drive them out from before you in one year; lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">By little and little I will drive them out from before you, until you be increased, and inherit the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And I will set your bounds from the Red sea even to the sea of the Philistines, and from the desert to the river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and you shall drive them out before you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">You shall make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin against me: for if you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you.</p>
