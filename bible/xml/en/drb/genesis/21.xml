  <verse number="1">And the Lord visited Sara, as he had promised: and fulfilled what he had spoken.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And she conceived and bore a son in her old age, at the time that God had foretold her.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Abraham called the name of his son, whom Sara bore him, Isaac.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he circumcised him the eighth day, as God had commanded him,</verse>
  <verse number="5">When he was a hundred years old: for at this age of his father was Isaac born.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Sara said: God hath made a laughter for me: whosoever shall hear of it will laugh with me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And again she said: Who would believe that Abraham should hear that Sara gave suck to a son, whom she bore to him in his old age.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the child grew and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast on the day of his weaning.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And when Sara had seen the son of Agar the Egyptian playing with Isaac her son, she said to Abraham:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Cast out this bondwoman, and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Abraham took this grievously for his son.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And God said to him: Let it not seem grievous to thee for the boy, and for thy bondwoman: in all that Sara hath said to thee, hearken to her voice: for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But I will make the son also of the bondwoman a great nation, because he is thy seed.</verse>
  <verse number="14">So Abraham rose up in the morning, and taking bread and a bottle of water, put it upon her shoulder, and delivered the boy, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Bersabee.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And when the water in the bottle was spent, she cast the boy under one of the trees that were there.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And she went her way, and sat over against him a great way off as far as a bow can carry, for she said: I will not see the boy die: and sitting over against, she lifted up her voice and wept.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And God heard the voice of the boy: and an angel of God called to Agar from heaven, saying: What art thou doing, Agar? fear not: for God hath heard the voice of the boy, from the place wherein he is.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Arise, take up the boy, and hold him by the hand: for I will make him a great nation.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And God opened her eyes: and she saw a well of water, and went and filled the bottle, and gave the boy to drink.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And God was with him: and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became a young man, an archer.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pharan, and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="22">At the same time Abimelech, and Phicol the general of his army said to Abraham: God is with thee in all that thou dost.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Swear therefore by God, that thou wilt not hurt me, nor my posterity, nor my stock: but according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land wherein thou hast lived a stranger.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Abraham said: I will swear.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he reproved Abimelech for a well of water, which his servants had taken away by force.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And Abimelech answered: I knew not who did this thing: and thou didst not tell me, and I heard not of it till to day.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech: and both of them made a league.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs of the flock.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Abimelech said to him: What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set apart?</verse>
  <verse number="30">But he said: Thou shalt take seven ewe lambs at my hand: that they may be a testimony for me, that I dug this well.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Therefore that place was called Bersabee: because both of them did swear.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And they made a league for the well of oath.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And Abimelech, and Phicol the general of his army arose and returned to the land of the Palestines. But Abraham planted a grove in Bersabee, and there called upon the name of the Lord God eternal.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And he was a sojourner in the land of the Palestines many days.</verse>
