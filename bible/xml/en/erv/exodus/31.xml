  <verse number="1">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">See, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:</verse>
  <verse number="3">and I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,</verse>
  <verse number="4">to devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,</verse>
  <verse number="5">and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all manner of workmanship.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee:</verse>
  <verse number="7">the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the Tent;</verse>
  <verse number="8">and the table and its vessels, and the pure candlestick with all its vessels, and the altar of incense;</verse>
  <verse number="9">and the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, and the laver and its base;</verse>
  <verse number="10">and the finely wrought garments, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest’s office;</verse>
  <verse number="11">and the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="13">Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily ye shall keep my sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that ye may know that I am the LORD which sanctify you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you: every one that profaneth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is a sabbath of solemn rest, holy to the LORD: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.</verse>
  <verse number="17">It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he gave unto Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him upon mount Sinai, the two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.</verse>
