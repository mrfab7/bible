<chapter book="Romans" number="6" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">What then shall we say? Shall we continue in sin, that grace might abound.</verse>
  <verse number="2">It may not be. We who died to sin, shall we yet live in it?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Or know ye not, that as many of us as were immersed in Christ Jesus, we were immersed into his death?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Therefore were we buried with him by immersion into death: that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so also we should walk in newness of life.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For if grown together we have been in the likeness of his death, but also shall we be of the resurrection:</verse>
  <verse number="6">Knowing this, that our old man was crucified together, that the body of sin might be left inactive, for us no more to serve sin.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For he having died was justified from sin.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And if we died with Christ, we believe we shall also live with him:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Knowing that Christ, raised from the dead, dies no more; death has no more power over him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For he who died, died to sin once: but he who lives, lives to God.</verse>
  <verse number="11">So also ye reckon yourselves truly to be dead to sin, and living to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Therefore let not sin reign in your mortal body, to listen to it in its passions.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Neither present ye your members weapons of injustice to sin: but present yourselves to God, as living from the dead, and your members weapons of justice to God.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For sin shall not rule over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace.</verse>
  <verse number="15">What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace It may not be.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves servants for obedience, ye are servants to whom ye listen; either of sin to death, or of obedience to justice?</verse>
  <verse number="17">And grace to God, that ye were servants of sin, but ye listened from the heart to the type of teaching in which ye were delivered.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And freed from sin, ye were subdued to justice.</verse>
  <verse number="19">(I speak as man through the weakness of your flesh:) for as ye presented your members to uncleanness and iniquity; so now present ye your members servants to justice for consecration.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For when ye were servants to sin, ye were free to justice.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Therefore what fruit had ye then of what ye are now ashamed? for the end of these, death.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And now freed from sin, and subdued to God, ye have your fruit to consecration, and the end life eternal.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For the purchasing the provisions of sin, death; and the grace of God, life eternal in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
