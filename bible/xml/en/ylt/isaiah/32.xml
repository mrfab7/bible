<chapter book="Isaiah" number="32" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Lo, for righteousness doth a king reign, As to princes, for judgment they rule.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And each hath been as a hiding-place from wind, And as a secret hiding-place from inundation, As rivulets of waters in a dry place, As a shadow of a heavy rock in a weary land.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And not dazzled are the eyes of beholders, And the ears of hearers do attend.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the heart of those hastened Understandeth to know, And the tongue of stammerers hasteth to speak clearly.</verse>
  <verse number="5">A fool is no more called ‘noble,’ And to a miser it is not said, ‘rich;’</verse>
  <verse number="6">For a fool speaketh folly, And his heart doth iniquity, to do profanity, And to speak concerning Jehovah error, To empty the soul of the hungry, Yea, drink of the thirsty he causeth to lack.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the miser—his instruments are evil, He hath counselled wicked devices, To corrupt the poor with lying sayings, Even when the needy speaketh justly.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the noble counselled noble things, And he for noble things riseth up.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Women, easy ones, rise, hear my voice, Daughters, confident ones, give ear to my saying,</verse>
  <verse number="10">Days and a year ye are troubled, O confident ones, For consumed hath been harvest, The gathering cometh not.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Tremble ye women, ye easy ones, Be troubled, ye confident ones, Strip and make bare, with a girdle on the loins,</verse>
  <verse number="12">For breasts they are lamenting, For fields of desire, for the fruitful vine.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Over the ground of my people thorn—brier goeth up, Surely over all houses of joy of the exulting city,</verse>
  <verse number="14">Surely the palace hath been left, The multitude of the city forsaken, Fort and watch-tower hath been for dens unto the age, A joy of wild asses—a pasture of herds;</verse>
  <verse number="15">Till emptied out on us is the Spirit from on high, And a wilderness hath become a fruitful field, And the fruitful field for a forest is reckoned.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And dwelt in the wilderness hath judgment, And righteousness in the fruitful field remaineth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And a work of the righteousness hath been peace, And a service of the righteousness—Keeping quiet and confidence unto the age.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And dwelt hath My people in a peaceful habitation, And in stedfast tabernacles, And in quiet resting-places.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And it hath hailed in the going down of the forest, And in the valley is the city low.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Happy are ye sowing by all waters, Sending forth the foot of the ox and the ass!</verse>
