  <verse number="2">And now, behold, the king going before you: and I grew old and I was gray-headed; and my sons, behold them with you: and I went before you from my youth even to this day.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Behold me: answer against me before Jehovah and before his Messiah, whose ox did I take? or whose ass did I take? and whom did I oppress? whom did I vex? and from whose hand did I take a ransom and hidden mine eyes with it? and I will turn back to you.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they will say, Thou didst not oppress us, and thou didst not vex us, and thou didst not take any thing from man’s hand.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he will say to them, Jehovah the witness against you, and his Messiah the witness this day that ye found nothing in my hand. And he will say, A witness.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Samuel will say to the people, Jehovah who made Moses and Aaron, and who brought up your fathers from the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And now, stand ye, and I will judge you before Jehovah, all the justices of Jehovah which he did with you and with your fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="8">When Jacob came into Egypt, and your fathers will cry to Jehovah, and Jehovah will send Moses and Aaron, and they will bring forth your fathers from Egypt, and they will turn them back into this place.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they will forget Jehovah their God, and he will sell them into the hand of Sisera, chief of the army of Razor, and into the hand of Philisteim, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they will war against them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they will cry to Jehovah, and say, We sinned, for we forsook Jehovah, and we shall serve the Baalims and Ashtaroth: and now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies and we will serve thee.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Jehovah will send Jerubbaal and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel, and he will deliver you from the hand of your enemies from round about, and ye shall dwell confidently.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And ye will see that Nahash, king of the sons of Ammon, came against you, and ye will say to me, Nay; but a king shall reign over us: and Jehovah your God your king.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And now, behold the king which ye chose, which ye asked! and behold, Jehovah gave a king over you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">If ye will fear Jehovah and serve him, and hear to his voice, and ye shall not rebel against the mouth of Jehovah, and ye shall be, also ye, and the king which reigned over you, after Jehovah your God.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And if ye will not hear to the voice of Jehovah, and rebel against the mouth of Jehovah, and the hand of the Lord was against you and your fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Also now stand ye and see this great word which Jehovah does before your eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Is it not the harvest of wheat this day? I will call to Jehovah and he will give voices and rain; and know ye and see that your wickedness is great which ye did in the eyes of Jehovah to ask for you a king.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Samuel will call to Jehovah, and Jehovah will give voices and rain in that day: and all the people will be greatly afraid of Jehovah and Samuel.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And all the people will say to Samuel, Pray for thy servants to Jehovah thy God, and we shall not die; for we added upon all our sins the wickedness to ask for us a king.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Samuel will say to the people, Ye shall not be afraid: ye did all this wickedness: but ye shall not turn aside from after Jehovah, and serve ye Jehovah with all your heart.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And ye shall not turn aside: for after vanities which will not profit, and they will not deliver, for they are vanities.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For Jehovah will not cast off his people on account of his great name, for Jehovah willed to make you to him for a people.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Also I, far be it to me sinning against Jehovah ceasing to pray for you: and I taught you in the good and straight way.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But fear ye Jehovah, and serve him in truth with all your heart: for see what he magnified with you.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And if doing evil, ye shall do evil, also ye, also your king; ye shall perish.</verse>
