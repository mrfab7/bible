<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Now the Jewsâ€™ feast of tabernacles was at hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">His brethren therefore said to him, Depart hence, and go into Judea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, show thyself to the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">(For neither did his brethren believe in him.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then Jesus said to them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always ready.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify concerning it, that its works are evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Go ye up to this feast: I go not yet to this feast, for my time is not yet full come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">When he had said these words to them, he abode still in Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But when his brethren had gone up, then he went also to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, No; but he deceiveth the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Yet, no man spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the Jews marveled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If any man will do his will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God, or whether I speak from myself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He that speaketh from himself, seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The people answered and said, Thou hast a demon: who goeth about to kill thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Moses therefore gave to you circumcision, (not because it is from Moses, but from the fathers) and ye on the sabbath circumcise a man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If a man on the sabbath receiveth circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have restored a man to sound health on the sabbath?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">But we know this man, whence he is: whereas when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Then cried Jesus in the temple, as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">But I know him; for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him: and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go to him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Ye will seek me, and will not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye will seek me, and will not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirsteth, let him come to me, and drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">(But this he spoke of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive, for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, In truth this is the Prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Will Christ come out of Galilee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh from the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">So there was a division among the people because of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have ye not brought him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">The officers answered, Never man spoke like this man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">Then the Pharisees answered them, Are ye also deceived?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">Have any of the rulers, or of the Pharisees believed on him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">But this people who know not the law are cursed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">Nicodemus saith to them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">Doth our law judge any man before it heareth him, and knoweth what he doeth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">They answered and said to him, Art thou also from Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">And every man went to his own house.</p>
