<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Timothy" data-chapter="6" data-translation="Darby Bible Translation" data-translation-id="dbt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Let as many bondmen as are under yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and the teaching be not blasphemed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And they that have believing masters, let them not despise [them] because they are brethren; but let them the rather serve them with subjection, because they are faithful and beloved, who profit by the good and ready service [rendered]. These things teach and exhort.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If any one teach differently, and do not accede to sound words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the teaching which [is] according to piety,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">he is puffed up, knowing nothing, but sick about questions and disputes of words, out of which arise envy, strife, injurious words, evil suspicions,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">constant quarrellings of men corrupted in mind and destitute of the truth, holding gain to be [the end of] piety.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But piety with contentment is great gain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For we have brought nothing into the world: [it is] [manifest] that neither can we carry anything out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But having sustenance and covering, we will be content with these.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and many unwise and hurtful lusts, which plunge men into destruction and ruin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For the love of money is [the] root of every evil; which some having aspired after, have wandered from the faith, and pierced themselves with many sorrows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But thou, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, piety, faith, love, endurance, meekness of spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Strive earnestly [in] the good conflict of faith. Lay hold of eternal life, to which thou hast been called, and hast confessed the good confession before many witnesses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">I enjoin thee before God who preserves all things in life, and Christ Jesus who witnessed before Pontius Pilate the good confession,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">that thou keep the commandment spotless, irreproachable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">which in its own time the blessed and only Ruler shall shew, the King of those that reign, and Lord of those that exercise lordship;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">who only has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light; whom no man has seen, nor is able to see; to whom [be] honour and eternal might. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Enjoin on those rich in the present age not to be high-minded, nor to trust on the uncertainty of riches; but in the God who affords us all things richly for [our] enjoyment;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">to do good, to be rich in good works, to be liberal in distributing, disposed to communicate [of their substance],</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">laying by for themselves a good foundation for the future, that they may lay hold of [what is] really life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">O Timotheus, keep the entrusted deposit, avoiding profane, vain babblings, and oppositions of false-named knowledge,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">of which some having made profession, have missed the faith. Grace [be] with thee.</p>
