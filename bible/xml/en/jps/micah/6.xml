  <verse number="1">Hear ye now what the LORD saith: Arise, contend thou before the mountains, And let the hills hear thy voice.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hear, O ye mountains, the LORD’S controversy, And ye enduring rocks, the foundations of the earth; For the LORD hath a controversy with His people, And He will plead with Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="3">O My people, what have I done unto thee? And wherein have I wearied thee? Testify against Me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, And redeemed thee out of the house of bondage, And I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</verse>
  <verse number="5">O My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, And what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; From Shittim unto Gilgal, That ye may know the righteous acts of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, And bow myself before God on high? Shall I come before Him with burnt-offerings, With calves of a year old?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, With ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my first-born for my transgression, The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?’</verse>
  <verse number="8">It hath been told thee, O man, what is good, And what the LORD doth require of thee: Only to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Hark! the LORD crieth unto the city—And it is wisdom to have regard for Thy name—Hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, And the scant measure that is abominable?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Shall I be pure with wicked balances, And with a bag of deceitful weights?’</verse>
  <verse number="12">For the rich men thereof are full of violence, And the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Therefore I also do smite thee with a grievous wound; I do make thee desolate because of thy sins.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; And thy sickness shall be in thine inward parts; And thou shalt conceive, but shalt not bring forth; And whomsoever thou bringest forth will I give up to the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thou shalt sow, but shalt not reap; Thou shalt tread the olives, but shalt not anoint thee with oil; And the vintage, but shalt not drink wine.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For the statutes of Omri are kept, And all the works of the house of Ahab, And ye walk in their counsels; That I may make thee an astonishment, And the inhabitants thereof a hissing; And ye shall bear the reproach of My people.</verse>
