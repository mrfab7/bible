<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Timothy" data-chapter="2" data-translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" data-translation-id="jps" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I exhort then, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be offered on behalf of all men;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">including kings and all who are in high station, in order that we may live peaceful and tranquil lives with all godliness and gravity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">This is right, and is pleasing in the sight of God our Saviour,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">who is willing for all mankind to be saved and come to a full knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For there is but one God and but one Mediator between God and men—Christ Jesus, Himself man;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">who gave Himself as the redemption price for all—a fact testified to at its own appointed time,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and of which I have been appointed a herald and an Apostle (I am speaking the truth: it is not a fiction)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">So then I would have the men everywhere pray, lifting to God holy hands which are unstained with anger or strife;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and I would have the women dress becomingly, with modesty and self-control, not with plaited hair or gold or pearls or costly clothes,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">but—as befits women making a claim to godliness—with the ornament of good works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">A woman should quietly learn from others with entire submissiveness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I do not permit a woman to teach, nor have authority over a man, but she must remain silent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For Adam was formed first, and then Eve;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and Adam was not deceived, but his wife was thoroughly deceived, and so became involved in transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Yet a woman will be brought safely through childbirth if she and her husband continue to live in faith and love and growing holiness, with habitual self-restraint.</p>
