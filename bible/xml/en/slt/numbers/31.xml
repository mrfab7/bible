  <verse number="2">Avenge the avenging of the sons of Israel of the Midianites: afterwards thou shalt be gathered to thy people.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Moses will speak to the people, saying, Arm from yourselves the men for war, and they shall be against Midian, to give the avenging of Jehovah upon Midian.</verse>
  <verse number="4">A thousand to a tribe, a thousand to a tribe, for all the tribes of Israel, ye shall send to war.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And there shall be separated from the thousands of Israel a thousand for a tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Moses will send them a thousand for a tribe, to war, them and Phinehas, son of Eleazar the priest, to war, and the holy vessels, and the trumpets of the signal in his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they will go forth against Midian as Jehovah commanded Moses; and they killed every male.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And they killed the kings of Midian upon those being slain: Evi and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: and they killed Balaam, son of Beor, with the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the sons of Israel will take captive the women of Midian and their little ones, and all their cattle, and all their possessions, and they plundered all their strength.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And their cities with their dwellings, and all their walls they burnt in fire.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And they will take all the plunder and all the spoil, in man and in cattle.</verse>

  <verse number="15">And Moses will say to them, Preserved ye alive every female?</verse>
  <verse number="16">Behold, they were to the sons of Israel by the word of Balaam for separating treacherously against Jehovah, concerning the word of Peor; and there will be a smiting in the assembly of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And now kill every male among the little ones; and every woman know in man by the bed of a male, do ye kill.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And all the little ones among the women who knew not the bed of a male, preserve ye alive for yourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And encamp ye without the camp seven days: every one killing a soul, and every one touching upon the wounded, ye shall be purified in the third day, and in the seventh day, ye and your captivity.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And every garment and every vessel of skin, and every work of goats’ hair, and every vessel of wood, ye shall purify.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Eleazar the priest will say to the men of war coming from the battle, This the law of instruction which Jehovah commanded Moses:</verse>
  <verse number="22">Only the gold and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Every thing which shall come through fire ye shall make pass through fire, and it was cleansed: only with the water of uncleanness shall it be purified: and all which will not come through the fire ye shall make pass through the water.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And wash ye your garments in the seventh day, and be purified, and afterwards ye shall come into the camp.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="26">Take the head of the spoil of the captivity, in man and in cattle, thou and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers of the assembly.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And divide the spoil between them taking hold of the battle, going forth to war, and between all the assembly:</verse>
  <verse number="28">And cast a tribute to Jehovah from the men of the battle going forth to war: one soul from five hundred, from the men and from the oxen, and from the asses, and from the sheep:</verse>
  <verse number="29">Ye shall take from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest, an offering of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And from the sons of Israel’s half thou shalt take one taking from fifty, from the men, from the oxen, from the asses, and from the sheep, from all the cattle, and give them to the Levites watching the watches of the dwelling of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And Moses will do, and Eleazar the priest, as the Lord commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And the remainder of the spoil plundered which the people of war plundered, will be six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,</verse>

  <verse number="42">And from the sons of Israel’s half which Moses divided from the men having warred,</verse>
  <verse number="43">(And the assembly’s half from the sheep, will be three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand five hundred,</verse>
  <verse number="44">And the oxen, six and thirty thousand,</verse>
  <verse number="45">And the asses, thirty thousand and five hundred,</verse>

  <verse number="47">Moses will take from the sons of Israel’s half, one taking from fifty, from man and from cattle, and he will give them to the Levites watching the watches of the tent of Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And there will come near to Moses the officers which are over the thousands of the war, captains of thousands and captains of hundreds:</verse>
  <verse number="49">And they will say to Moses, Thy servants took the head of the men of the battle which are in our hand, and a man was not missed from us.</verse>
  <verse number="50">And we will bring an offering to Jehovah, what each found, vessels of gold, armbands, and bracelets, rings, ear-rings, and globules of gold, to expiate for our souls before Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="51">And Moses will take, and Eleazar the priest, all the gold from them, all the vessels of work.</verse>
  <verse number="52">And all the gold of the offering which they lifted up to Jehovah, will be sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels, from the captains of thousands and from the captains of hundreds.</verse>
