<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the Lord revealed to me: Jesus the high priest, standing in the sight of the angel of the Lord. And Satan stood before his right hand, so as to be his adversary.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the Lord said to Satan, “May the Lord rebuke you, Satan! And may the Lord, who chose Jerusalem, rebuke you! Are you not a firebrand plucked from the fire?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Jesus was clothed with filthy garments. And he stood before the face of an angel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He answered and spoke to those who stood before him, saying, “Take away the filthy garments from him.” And he said to him, “Behold, I have taken away from you your iniquity, and I have clothed you with a change of clothing.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And he said, “Place a clean diadem on his head.” And they placed a clean diadem on his head, and they clothed him with garments. And the angel of the Lord remained standing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the angel of the Lord contested with Jesus, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thus says the Lord of hosts: If you will walk in my ways and keep my charge, you likewise will judge my house and will keep my courts, and I will give you some of those who now attend here to walk with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Listen, Jesus the high priest, you and your friends, who dwell before you, who have been portending to men. For behold, I will lead my servant to the East.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For behold, the stone that I have bestowed before Jesus. Upon one stone, there are seven eyes. Behold, I will carve its engraving, says the Lord of hosts. And I will take away the iniquity of that land in one day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">On that day, says the Lord of hosts, every man will call his friend from under the vine and from under the fig tree.</p>
