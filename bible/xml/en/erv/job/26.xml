  <verse number="1">Then Job answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">How hast thou helped him that is without power! how hast thou saved the arm that hath no strength!</verse>
  <verse number="3">How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge!</verse>
  <verse number="4">To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came forth from thee?</verse>
  <verse number="5">They that are deceased tremble beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Sheol is naked before him, and Abaddon hath no covering.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He stretcheth out the north over empty space, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He closeth in the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He hath described a boundary upon the face of the waters, unto the confines of light and darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his rebuke.</verse>
  <verse number="12">He stirreth up the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab.</verse>
  <verse number="13">By his spirit the heavens are garnished; his hand hath pierced the swift serpent.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Lo, these are but the outskirts of his ways: and how small a whisper do we hear of him! but the thunder of his power who can understand?</verse>
