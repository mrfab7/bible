  <verse number="4">The Lord has wrought all things because of himself. Likewise the impious is for the evil day.</verse>
  <verse number="5">All the arrogant are an abomination to the Lord. Even if hand will be joined to hand, he is not innocent. The beginning of a good way is to do justice. And this is more acceptable with God than to immolate sacrifices.</verse>
  <verse number="6">By mercy and truth, iniquity is redeemed. And by the fear of the Lord, one turns away from evil.</verse>

  <verse number="14">The indignation of a king is a herald of death. And the wise man will appease it.</verse>
  <verse number="15">In the cheerfulness of the king’s countenance, there is life. And his clemency is like belated rain.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Possess wisdom, for it is better than gold. And acquire prudence, for it is more precious than silver.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The path of the just turns away from evils. He who guards his soul preserves his way.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Arrogance precedes destruction. And the spirit is exalted before a fall.</verse>
  <verse number="19">It is better to be humbled with the meek, than to divide spoils with the arrogant.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The learned in word shall find good things. And whoever hopes in the Lord is blessed.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Whoever is wise in heart shall be called prudent. And whoever is sweet in eloquence shall attain to what is greater.</verse>

  <verse number="25">There is a way which seems right to a man, and its end result leads to death.</verse>
  <verse number="26">The soul of the laborer labors for himself, because his mouth has driven him to it.</verse>
  <verse number="27">The impious man digs up evil, and in his lips is a burning fire.</verse>
  <verse number="28">A perverse man stirs up lawsuits. And one who is verbose divides leaders.</verse>
  <verse number="29">A man of iniquity entices his friend, and he leads him along a way that is not good.</verse>

  <verse number="32">A patient man is better than a strong one. And whoever rules his soul is better than one who assaults cities.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Lots are cast into the lap, but they are tempered by the Lord.</verse>
