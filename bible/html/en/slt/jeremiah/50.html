<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The word that Jehovah spake against Babel, against the land of the Chaldeans, by the hand of Jeremiah the prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Announce ye in the nations, and cause to be heard, and lift up a signal; cause to be heard, ye shall not hide: say, Babel was taken, Bel was ashamed, Merodach was broken; her images were ashamed, her blocks were broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For a nation came up from the north against her; it shall set her land for a desolation, and none shall be dwelling in her: from man and even to beast they moved, and they went.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">In those days and in that time, says Jehovah, the sons of Israel shall come, they and the sons of Judah together, going, and they wept: they shall go and shall seek Jehovah their God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">To Zion shall they ask the way, thither their faces: Come ye, and we will join ourselves to Jehovah an eternal covenant; it shall not be forgotten.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">My people were lost sheep: their shepherds caused them to wander, they turned them away in the mountains: they went from mountain to hill, they forgot their place to lie down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All finding them consumed them: and their adversaries said, We shall not transgress, for they sinned against Jehovah the habitation of justice, and the hope of their fathers, Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Move from the midst of Babel, and from the land of the Chaldeans; come forth and be ye as the he goats before the flock.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For behold I raise up and bring up against Babel a convocation of great nations from the land of the north: and they arranged against her; from thence she shall be taken: his arrow as of a strong destroyer shall not turn back in vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Chaldea was for a spoil: all spoiling her shall be satisfied, says Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Because thou wilt be glad, because thou wilt exult, ye plundering mine inheritance, because thou wilt show off proudly as a heifer at grass, and thou wilt neigh as the strong ones;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Your mother was greatly ashamed; she bearing you was put to shame: behold the last of the nations a desert, dryness and a sterile region.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">From the wrath of Jehovah she shall not be inhabited, and it was wholly a desolation: every one passing over Babel shall be astonished and shall hiss at all her blows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Arrange yourselves against Babel round about: all ye bending the bow, cast at her, ye shall not spare to the arrow, for she sinned against Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Shout against her round about: she gave her hand: her supports fell, her walls were pulled down: for it is the vengeance of Jehovah: avenge ye upon her; as she did, do ye to her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Cut off him sowing from Babel, and him holding the sickle in time of harvest: from the face of the Grecian sword they shall turn a man to his people, and they shall flee a man to his land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Israel a scattered sheep; the lions thrust away: first the king of Assur consumed him; and the last this Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel bound him fast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For this, thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Behold me reviewing for the king of Babel, and for his land, as I reviewed to the king of Assur.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And I turned back Israel to his habitation, and he fed in Carmel and Bashan; and upon mount Ephraim and Gilead shall his soul be satisfied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In those days and in that time, says Jehovah, he will seek the iniquity of Israel, and not any; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I shall forgive to whom I shall leave.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Go up against the land of double rebellion, against her, and against the inhabitants of Pekod, laying waste and destroying after them, says Jehovah; and do according to all which I commanded thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The voice of war in the land, and a great breaking.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">How was the hammer of all the earth cut off, and it will be broken! How was Babel for a desolation among the nations!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">I laid snares for thee and also thou wert taken, O Babel, and thou knewest not: thou wert found and thou wert also taken, for thou didst contend against Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Jehovah opened his treasure, and he will bring forth the vessels of his anger: for this the work to the Lord Jehovah of armies in the land of the Chaldeans.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Come ye against her from the extremity; open her store-houses: cast her up as heaps and exterminate her: there shall be no remnant to her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Lay waste all her bullocks; come down to the slaughter: wo to them! for their day came, the time of their reviewing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The voice of those fleeing and escaping out of the land of Babel, to announce in Zion the vengeance of Jehovah our God, the vengeance of his temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Cause ye many to be heard against Babel: all ye bending the bow encamp against her round about; there shall be no escaping: requite her according to her work; according to all she did, do to her: for she acted proudly against Jehovah, against the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">For this her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of her war shall be destroyed in that day, says Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Behold me against thee, O pride, says the Lord Jehovah of armies: for thy day came, the time I reviewed thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And pride stumbled and fell, and none lifting up to it: and I kindled a fire in his cities and it shall consume all round about him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Thus said Jehovah of armies: the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah being oppressed together: and all taking them captive held upon them; they refused to send them away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">He redeeming them is strong; Jehovah of armies, his name: pleading, he will plead their cause, so that he caused the land to rest, and caused disquiet to the inhabitants of Babel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">A sword upon the Chaldeans, says Jehovah, and to the inhabitants of Babel and to her chiefs, and to her wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">A sword against the liars; and they were foolish: a sword against her strong ones, and they were broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">A sword against his horses and against his chariots, and against all the mixture which is in her midst; and they were for women: a sword against her treasures, and they were plundered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">A sword upon her waters, and they shall be dried up: for it is a land of carved images, and in their terrors they will be foolish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">For this the inhabitans of the deserts shall dwell with the islands, and the daughters of the ostrich shall dwell in her: and it shall be no more inhabited forever; and she shall not be dwelt in even to generation and generation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and her neighbors, says Jehovah; a man shall not dwell there, and the son of man shall not sojourn in her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Behold, a people coming from the north and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the thighs of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">They shall hold the bow and the javelin: they are fierce, and they will not pity: their voice shall sound as the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, being arranged as a man for war, against thee, O daughter of Babel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">The king of Babel heard their report, and his hands were relaxed: anguish seized him as the pain of her bringing forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">Behold, as a lion he will come up from the excellency of Jordan to the habitation of strength: for I will wink; I will cause them to run away from her: and who the chosen I shall appoint to her? for who like me? and who shall arraign me? and who that shepherd who shall stand before me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">For this, hear ye the counsel of Jehovah which he counseled against Babel; and his purposes which he purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: if the last of the flock shall not drag them out: if he shall not lay waste the habitation upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">From the voice of the taking of Babel the earth was shaken, and the cry was heard among the nations.</p>
