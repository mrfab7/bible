<p class="verse" data-verse="1">How is the gold become dim! How is the most fine gold changed! The hallowed stones are poured out At the head of every street.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The precious sons of Zion, Comparable to fine gold, How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, The work of the hands of the potter!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Even the jackals draw out the breast, They give suck to their young ones; The daughter of my people is become cruel, Like the ostriches in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth To the roof of his mouth for thirst; The young children ask bread, And none breaketh it unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">They that did feed on dainties Are desolate in the streets; They that were brought up in scarlet Embrace dunghills.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater Than the sin of Sodom, That was overthrown as in a moment, And no hands fell upon her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Her princes were purer than snow, They were whiter than milk, They were more ruddy in body than rubies, Their polishing was as of sapphire;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Their visage is blacker than a coal; They are not known in the streets; Their skin is shrivelled upon their bones; It is withered, it is become like a stick.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They that are slain with the sword are better Than they that are slain with hunger; For these pine away, stricken through, For want of the fruits of the field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The hands of women full of compassion Have sodden their own children; They were their food In the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The LORD hath accomplished His fury, He hath poured out His fierce anger; And He hath kindled a fire in Zion, Which hath devoured the foundations thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The kings of the earth believed not, Neither all the inhabitants of the world, That the adversary and the enemy would enter Into the gates of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">It is because of the sins of her prophets, And the iniquities of her priests, That have shed the blood of the just In the midst of her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">They wander as blind men in the streets, They are polluted with blood, So that men cannot Touch their garments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Depart ye! unclean!’ men cried unto them, ‘Depart, depart, touch not’; Yea, they fled away and wandered; Men said among the nations: ‘They shall no more sojourn here.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The anger of the LORD hath divided them; He will no more regard them; They respected not the persons of the priests, They were not gracious unto the elders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">As for us, our eyes do yet fail For our vain help; In our watching we have watched For a nation that could not save.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">They hunt our steps, That we cannot go in our broad places; Our end is near, our days are fulfilled; For our end is come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Our pursuers were swifter Than the eagles of the heaven; They chased us upon the mountains, They lay in wait for us in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, Was taken in their pits; Of whom we said: ‘Under his shadow We shall live among the nations.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, That dwellest in the land of Uz: The cup shall pass over unto thee also; Thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion, He will no more carry thee away into captivity; He will punish thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom, He will uncover thy sins.</p>
