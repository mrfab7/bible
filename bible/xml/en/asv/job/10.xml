  <verse number="1">My soul is weary of my life; I will give free course to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; Show me wherefore thou contendest with me.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, That thou shouldest despise the work of thy hands, And shine upon the counsel of the wicked?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Hast thou eyes of flesh? Or seest thou as man seeth?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Are thy days as the days of man, Or thy years as man’s days,</verse>
  <verse number="6">That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, And searchest after my sin,</verse>
  <verse number="7">Although thou knowest that I am not wicked, And there is none that can deliver out of thy hand?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thy hands have framed me and fashioned me Together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast fashioned me as clay; And wilt thou bring me into dust again?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Hast thou not poured me out as milk, And curdled me like cheese?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, And knit me together with bones and sinews.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Thou hast granted me life and lovingkindness; And thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Yet these things thou didst hide in thy heart; I know that this is with thee:</verse>
  <verse number="14">If I sin, then thou markest me, And thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="15">If I be wicked, woe unto me; And if I be righteous, yet shall I not lift up my head; Being filled with ignominy, And looking upon mine affliction.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And if my head exalt itself, thou huntest me as a lion; And again thou showest thyself marvellous upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, And increasest thine indignation upon me: Changes and warfare are with me.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Are not my days few? cease then, And let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,</verse>
  <verse number="21">Before I go whence I shall not return, Even to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;</verse>
  <verse number="22">The land dark as midnight, The land of the shadow of death, without any order, And where the light is as midnight.</verse>
