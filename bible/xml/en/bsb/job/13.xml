<chapter book="Job" number="13" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">“Indeed, my eyes have seen all this; my ears have heard and understood.</verse>
  <verse number="2">What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Yet I desire to speak to the Almighty and argue my case before God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">You, however, smear with lies; you are all worthless physicians.</verse>
  <verse number="5">If only you would remain silent; for that would be your wisdom!</verse>
  <verse number="6">Hear now my argument, and listen to the plea of my lips.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Will you speak wickedly on God’s behalf or speak deceitfully for Him?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Would you show Him partiality or argue in His defense?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Would it be well when He examined you? Could you deceive Him as you would deceive a man?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Surely He would rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Would His majesty not terrify you? Would the dread of Him not fall upon you?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Be silent, and I will speak. Then let come to me what may.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Why do I put myself at risk and take my life in my own hands?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Though He slay me, I will hope in Him. I will still defend my ways to His face.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Moreover, this will be my salvation, for no godless man can appear before Him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Listen carefully to my words; let my declaration ring in your ears.</verse>
  <verse number="18">See now, I have prepared my case; I know that I will be vindicated.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Can anyone indict me? If so, I will be silent and die.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Only grant these two things to me, so that I need not hide from You:</verse>
  <verse number="21">Withdraw Your hand from me, and do not let Your terror frighten me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Then call me, and I will answer, or let me speak, and You can reply.</verse>
  <verse number="23">How many are my iniquities and sins? Reveal to me my transgression and sin.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Why do You hide Your face and consider me as Your enemy?</verse>
  <verse number="25">Would You frighten a windblown leaf? Would You chase after dry chaff?</verse>
  <verse number="26">For You record bitter accusations against me and bequeath to me the iniquities of my youth.</verse>
  <verse number="27">You put my feet in the stocks and stand watch over all my paths; You set a limit for the soles of my feet.</verse>
  <verse number="28">So man wastes away like something rotten, like a moth-eaten garment.</verse>
