<chapter book="Job" number="27" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Job continued his discourse:</verse>
  <verse number="2">“As surely as God lives, who has deprived me of justice—the Almighty, who has embittered my soul—</verse>
  <verse number="3">as long as my breath is still within me and the breath of God remains in my nostrils,</verse>
  <verse number="4">my lips will not speak wickedness, and my tongue will not utter deceit.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I will never say that you are right; I will maintain my integrity until I die.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I will cling to my righteousness and never let go. As long as I live, my conscience will not accuse me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">May my enemy be like the wicked and my opponent like the unjust.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For what is the hope of the godless when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Will God hear his cry when distress comes upon him?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Will he delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?</verse>
  <verse number="11">I will instruct you in the power of God. I will not conceal the ways of the Almighty.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Surely all of you have seen it for yourselves. Why then do you keep up this empty talk?</verse>
  <verse number="13">This is the wicked man’s portion from God—the heritage the ruthless receive from the Almighty.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Though his sons are many, they are destined for the sword; and his offspring will never have enough food.</verse>
  <verse number="15">His survivors will be buried by the plague, and their widows will not weep for them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Though he heaps up silver like dust and piles up a wardrobe like clay,</verse>
  <verse number="17">what he lays up, the righteous will wear, and his silver will be divided by the innocent.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The house he built is like a moth’s cocoon, like a hut set up by a watchman.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, all is gone.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Terrors overtake him like a flood; a tempest sweeps him away in the night.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The east wind carries him away, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.</verse>
  <verse number="22">It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power.</verse>
  <verse number="23">It claps its hands at him and hisses him out of his place.</verse>
