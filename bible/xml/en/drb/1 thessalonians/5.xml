  <verse number="1">But of the times and moments, brethren, you need not, that we should write to you;</verse>
  <verse number="2">For yourselves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord shall so come, as a thief in the night.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For when they shall say, peace and security; then shall sudden destruction come upon them, as the pains upon her that is with child, and they shall not escape.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For all you are the children of light, and children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Therefore, let us not sleep, as others do; but let us watch, and be sober.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For they that sleep, sleep in the night; and they that are drunk, are drunk in the night.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But let us, who are of the day, be sober, having on the breastplate of faith and charity, and for a helmet the hope of salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For God hath not appointed us unto wrath, but unto the purchasing of salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
  <verse number="10">Who died for us; that, whether we watch or sleep, we may live together with him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For which cause comfort one another; and edify one another, as you also do.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And we beseech you, brethren, to know them who labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you:</verse>
  <verse number="13">That you esteem them more abundantly in charity, for their work’s sake. Have peace with them.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And we beseech you, brethren, rebuke the unquiet, comfort the feeble minded, support the weak, be patient towards all men.</verse>
  <verse number="15">See that none render evil for evil to any man; but ever follow that which is good towards each other, and towards all men.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Always rejoice.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Pray without ceasing.</verse>
  <verse number="18">In all things give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you all.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Extinguish not the spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Despise not prophecies.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</verse>
  <verse number="22">From all appearance of evil refrain yourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And may the God of peace himself sanctify you in all things; that your whole spirit, and soul, and body, may be preserved blameless in the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He is faithful who hath called you, who also will do it.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Brethren, pray for us.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.</verse>
  <verse number="27">I charge you by the Lord, that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</verse>
