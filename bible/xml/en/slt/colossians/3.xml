  <verse number="1">If therefore ye be risen with Christ, seek things above, where Christ is sitting on the right hand of God.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Think of things above, and not upon those upon the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For ye died, and your life has been hid with Christ in God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">When Christ shall be manifested, our life, then also ye with him shall be made manifest in glory.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Therefore kill your members that are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry:</verse>
  <verse number="6">For these comes the Wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience:</verse>
  <verse number="7">In which also ye then walked, when ye lived in them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And now ye also put them all away; anger, wrath, badness, slander, shameful language out of your mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Lie not to one another, having put off the old man with big deeds;</verse>
  <verse number="10">And having put on the new, being renewed in knowledge according to the image of him having created him:</verse>
  <verse number="11">Where no Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, servant, free: but Christ all things, and in all.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Put on therefore, as the chosen of God, holy and beloved, bowels of compassions, kindnesses, humility, meekness, longsuffering;</verse>
  <verse number="13">(Bearing one another, propitiating one another, if any have a complaint against any: as also Christ propitiated for you, so also ye.)</verse>
  <verse number="14">And over all these, love, which is the bond of completion.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And let the peace of God act as umpire in your hearts, to which also, ye were called in one body: and be grateful.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Let the word of Christ dwell in, you richly; teaching and reminding one another in all wisdom, playing with harps, and songs, and spiritual odes, with grace singing in your hearts to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And all whatever you do in word and in work, all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Women, place yourselves under your own husbands, as was permitted in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Men, love ye the wives, and be not embittered against them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Children, listen to parents in all things: for this is pleasing to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Fathers, irritate not your children, lest they be discouraged.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Servants, listen ye in all things to lords according to the flesh; not in eyeservice as pleasing men; but in simplicity of heart, fearing God:</verse>
  <verse number="23">And all, whatever ye do, work ye from the soul, as to the Lord, and not to men;</verse>
  <verse number="24">Knowing that from the Lord ye shall receive the reward of inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he acting with injustice shall be taken care of for what he did unjustly: and there is no distinction of persons.</verse>
