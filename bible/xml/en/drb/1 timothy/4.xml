<chapter book="1 Timothy" number="4" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now the Spirit manifestly saith, that in the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to spirits of error, and doctrines of devils,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Speaking lies in hypocrisy, and having their conscience seared,</verse>
  <verse number="3">Forbidding to marry, to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by the faithful, and by them that have known the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be rejected that is received with thanksgiving:</verse>
  <verse number="5">For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</verse>
  <verse number="6">These things proposing to the brethren, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished up in the words of faith, and of the good doctrine which thou hast attained unto.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But avoid foolish and old wives’ fables: and exercise thyself unto godliness.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For bodily exercise is profitable to little: but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</verse>
  <verse number="9">A faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For therefore we labor and are reviled, because we hope in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful.</verse>
  <verse number="11">These things command and teach.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Let no man despise thy youth: but be thou an example of the faithful in word, in conversation, in charity, in faith, in chastity.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Till I come, attend unto reading, to exhortation, and to doctrine.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Neglect not the grace that is in thee, which was given thee by prophesy, with imposition of the hands of the priesthood.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Meditate upon these things, be wholly in these things: that thy profiting may be manifest to all.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Take heed to thyself and to doctrine: be earnest in them. For in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee.</verse>
