<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My little children, I write these to you, that ye sin not. And if any sin, we have an intercessor with the Father, Jesus Christ the just:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And in this we know that we have known him, if we should keep his commands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He saying, I have known him, and not keeping his commands, is a liar, and in him is not the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Whoever should keep his word, truly in him has the word of God been completed: in this we know that we are in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He saying he remains in him ought, as he walked about, so also he to walk about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Brethren, I write no new command to you, but an old command which ye had from the beginning. The old command is the word which ye heard from the beginning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Again, I write a new command to you, which is true in him and in you: for the darkness is passed away, and the true light already shines.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He saying he is in the light, and hating his brother, is in the darkness even until now.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He loving his brother remains in light, and there is no stumbling-block in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And he hating his brother is in darkness, and walks about in darkness, and knows not where he goes forward, for darkness has blinded his eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I write to you, little children, for your sins are let go for his name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">I write to you, fathers, for ye have known him from the beginning. I write to you, young men, for ye have conquered the evil. I write to you, young children, for ye have known the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I wrote to you, fathers, for ye have known him from the beginning. I wrote to you, young men, for ye are strong, and the word of God remains in you, and ye have conquered the evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Love not the world, nor the things in the world. If any love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For every thing which in the world, the eager desire of the flesh, and the eager desire of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the world passes away, and its eager desires: but he doing the will of God remains for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Young children, it is the last hour: and as ye have heard that antichrist comes, and now many antichrists have come; whence we know that it is the last hour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they had remained with us, but, that they might be manifested, that they are not all of us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And ye have an anointing from the Holy One, and know all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">I have not written to you because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Who is a liar if not he denying that Jesus is the Christ? He is antichrist, denying the Father and the Son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Every one denying the Son, neither has the Father: he acknowledging the Son, has also the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">What therefore ye have heard from the beginning, let remain in you. If it remain in you what ye heard from the beginning, ye also shall remain in the Son, and in the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And this is the promise which he promised us, eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">These I wrote to you concerning them deceiving you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And the anointing which ye received from him remains in you, and ye have no need that any teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is true, and is no lie, and as it taught you, ye shall remain in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And now, little children, remain in him; that, when he be manifested, we might have freedom of speech, that we be not shamed from him in his presence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">If ye know that he is just, ye know that every one doing justice has been born of him.</p>
