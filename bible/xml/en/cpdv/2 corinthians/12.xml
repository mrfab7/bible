<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="12" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">If it is necessary (though certainly not expedient) to glory, then I will next tell of visions and revelations from the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I know a man in Christ, who, more than fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I do not know, or out of the body, I do not know: God knows), was enraptured to the third heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I know a certain man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I do not know: God knows),</verse>
  <verse number="4">who was enraptured into Paradise. And he heard words of mystery, which it is not permitted for man to speak.</verse>
  <verse number="5">On behalf of someone like this, I will glory. But on behalf of myself, I will not glory about anything, except my infirmities.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For even though I am willing to glory, I will not be foolish. But I will speak the truth. Yet I will do so sparingly, lest anyone may consider me to be anything more than what he sees in me, or anything more than what he hears from me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And lest the greatness of the revelations should extol me, there was given to me a prodding in my flesh: an angel of Satan, who struck me repeatedly.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Because of this, three times I petitioned the Lord that it might be taken away from me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he said to me: “My grace is sufficient for you. For virtue is perfected in weakness.” And so, willingly shall I glory in my weaknesses, so that the virtue of Christ may live within me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Because of this, I am pleased in my infirmity: in reproaches, in difficulties, in persecutions, in distresses, for the sake of Christ. For when I am weak, then I am powerful.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I have become foolish; you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you. For I have been nothing less than those who claim to be above the measure of Apostles, even though I am nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the seal of my Apostleship has been set over you, with all patience, with signs and wonders and miracles.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For what is there that you have had which is less than the other churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this injury.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Behold, this is the third time I have prepared to come to you, and yet I will not be a burden to you. For I am seeking not the things that are yours, but you yourselves. And neither should the children store up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And so, very willingly, I will spend and exhaust myself for the sake of your souls, loving you more, while being loved less.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And so be it. I have not burdened you, but instead, being astute, I obtained you by guile.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And yet, did I defraud you by means of any of those whom I sent to you?</verse>
  <verse number="18">I asked for Titus, and I sent a brother with him. Did Titus defraud you? Did we not walk with the same spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Have you ever thought that we should explain ourselves to you? We speak in the sight of God, in Christ. But all things, most beloved, are for your edification.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Yet I fear, lest perhaps, when I have arrived, I might not find you such as I would want, and I might be found by you, such as you would not want. For perhaps there may be among you: contention, envy, animosity, dissension, detraction, whispering, self-exaltation, and rebellion.</verse>
  <verse number="21">If so, then, when I have arrived, God may again humble me among you. And so, I mourn for the many who sinned beforehand, and did not repent, over the lust and fornication and homosexuality, which they have committed.</verse>
