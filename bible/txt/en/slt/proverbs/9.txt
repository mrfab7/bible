1	Wisdom built her house, she hewed out her seven pillars:
2	She slaughtered her slaughter; she mingled her wine; also she prepared her table.
3	She sent forth her girls: she will call upon the wings of the heights of the city,
4	Who the simple, he shall turn aside here: he wanting heart, she said to him,
5	Come ye, eat of my bread, and drink ye of the wine I mingled.
6	Forsake ye the foolish, and live; and go straight in the way of understanding.
7	He instructing him mocking received to himself dishonor: and he reproving to the unjust one, his blemish.
8	Thou shalt not reprove him mocking, lest he shall hate thee: reprove to the wise one and he will love thee.
9	Thou shalt give to the wise one and he will be more wise: make known to the just one and he will add receiving.
10	The beginning of wisdom is the fear of Jehovah, and the knowledge of the holy ones is understanding.
11	For in me thy days shall be multiplied, and years of life shall be added to thee.
12	If thou wert wise, thou wert wise for thyself: and thou mockedst, thou alone shalt suffer.
13	A woman of folly being noisy, simple, and she knew not anything.
14	And sitting at the door of her house, upon the throne of the heights of the city,
15	To call to those passing the way, making straight their paths:
16	Who is simple, he shall turn aside here: and he wanting heart, and she said to him,
17	Stolen waters will be sweet, and the bread of secrets shall be pleasant.
18	And he knew not that there the shades; her called ones in the depths of hades.
