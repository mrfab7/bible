<chapter book="1 Peter" number="2" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Why laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,</verse>
  <verse number="2">As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby:</verse>
  <verse number="3">If so be you have tasted that the Lord is gracious.</verse>
  <verse number="4">To whom coming, as to a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,</verse>
  <verse number="5">You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Why also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be confounded.</verse>
  <verse number="7">To you therefore which believe he is precious: but to them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,</verse>
  <verse number="8">And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light;</verse>
  <verse number="10">Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</verse>
  <verse number="12">Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Or to governors, as to them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do well.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For so is the will of God, that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</verse>
  <verse number="16">As free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the fraudulent.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For this is thank worthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongfully.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For what glory is it, if, when you be buffeted for your faults, you shall take it patiently? but if, when you do well, and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For even hereunto were you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow his steps:</verse>
  <verse number="22">Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</verse>
  <verse number="23">Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judges righteously:</verse>
  <verse number="24">Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For you were as sheep going astray; but are now returned to the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</verse>
