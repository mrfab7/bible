<chapter book="John" number="10" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Truly, truly, I say to you, He not coming in through the door into the court-yard of the sheep, but coming up from another place, he is a thief and robber.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he coming in through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="3">To him the guard of the door opens; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And when he would put forth his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And a stranger they would not follow, but they will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.</verse>
  <verse number="6">This proverb spake Jesus to then: and they knew not what things they were which he spake to them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then said Jesus again to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, That I am the door of the sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="8">All who came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep heard them not.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I am the door: if any come in through me, he shall be saved, and he shall me in, and go out, and find pasture.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The thief comes not, except that he steal, and sacrifice, and destroy: I came that they might have life, and have above measure.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But the hired one, and not being the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and he leaves the sheep, and flees: and the wolf plunders them, and scatters the sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The hired flees, because he is hired, and no care is to him for the sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I am the good shepherd, and I know mine, and am known by mine.</verse>
  <verse number="15">As the Father knows me, I also know the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And I have, other sheep, which are not of this court-yard: and I must also bring them, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, and one shepherd.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.</verse>
  <verse number="18">No one takes it away from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command received I of my Father.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Then was a division again among the Jews for these words.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And many of them said, He has a demon, and is frenzied; why hear ye him?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Others said, These are not the words of a demon. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And there was the festival of inauguration among the Jerusalemites, and it was winter.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then the Jews surrounded him, and said to him, How long takest thou away our soul? If thou art Christ, say to us with freedom of speech.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Jesus answered them, I said to you, and ye believe not: the works which I do in my Father’s name, these testify of me.</verse>
  <verse number="26">But ye believe not, for ye are not of my sheep, as I said to you.</verse>
  <verse number="27">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And I give them eternal life; and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of my hand.</verse>
  <verse number="29">My Father, who has given to me, is greater than all; and no one can snatch them out of my Father’s hand.</verse>
  <verse number="30">I and my Father are one.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Then again lifted up the Jews stones that they might stone him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Jesus Answered them, Many good works I shewed you from my Father; for which of these works do ye stone me.</verse>
  <verse number="33">The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and that thou, being man, makest thyself God.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said; Ye are gods?</verse>
  <verse number="35">If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the writing cannot be loosed;</verse>
  <verse number="36">Whom the Father consecrated, and sent into the world, say ye that thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="37">If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And if I do, though ye believe me not, believe the works: that ye might know, and believe, that the Father in me, and I in him.</verse>
  <verse number="39">Then sought they again to take him: and he went out from their hand,</verse>
  <verse number="40">And again he departed beyond Jordan to the place where John was first immersing; and he remained there.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And many came to him, and said, That truly John did no sign: but all which John said of him was true.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And many believed in him there.</verse>
