  <verse number="3">She has sent out her maidens. She cries from the highest places of the city:</verse>
  <verse number="4">“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” As for him who is void of understanding, she says to him,</verse>
  <verse number="5">“Come, eat some of my bread, Drink some of the wine which I have mixed!</verse>
  <verse number="6">Leave your simple ways, and live. Walk in the way of understanding.”</verse>
  <verse number="7">He who corrects a mocker invites insult. He who reproves a wicked man invites abuse.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Don’t reprove a scoffer, lest he hate you. Reprove a wise man, and he will love you.</verse>

  <verse number="17">“Stolen water is sweet. Food eaten in secret is pleasant.”</verse>
