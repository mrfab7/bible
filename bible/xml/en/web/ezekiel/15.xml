  <verse number="1">The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, the vine-branch which is among the trees of the forest?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Shall wood be taken of it to make any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire has devoured both its ends, and its midst is burned: is it profitable for any work?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less, when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned, shall it yet be meet for any work!</verse>
  <verse number="6">Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I will set my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire, but the fire shall devour them; and you shall know that I am Yahweh, when I set my face against them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, says the Lord Yahweh.</verse>
