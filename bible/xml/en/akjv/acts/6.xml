  <verse number="1">And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them, and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Why, brothers, look you out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:</verse>
  <verse number="6">Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spoke.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came on him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,</verse>
  <verse number="13">And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceases not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:</verse>
  <verse number="14">For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.</verse>
