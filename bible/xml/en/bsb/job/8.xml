  <verse number="1">Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:</verse>
  <verse number="2">“How long will you go on saying such things? The words of your mouth are a blustering wind.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?</verse>
  <verse number="4">When your children sinned against Him, He gave them over to their rebellion.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But if you would earnestly seek God and ask the Almighty for mercy,</verse>
  <verse number="6">if you are pure and upright, even now He will rouse Himself on your behalf and restore your righteous estate.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Though your beginnings were modest, your latter days will flourish.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Please inquire of past generations and consider the discoveries of their fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For we were born yesterday and know nothing; our days on earth are but a shadow.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Will they not teach you and tell you, and speak from their understanding?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Does papyrus grow where there is no marsh? Do reeds flourish without water?</verse>
  <verse number="12">While the shoots are still uncut, they dry up more quickly than grass.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Such is the destiny of all who forget God; so the hope of the godless will perish.</verse>
  <verse number="14">His confidence is fragile; his security is in a spider’s web.</verse>
  <verse number="15">He leans on his web, but it gives way; he holds fast, but it does not endure.</verse>
  <verse number="16">He is a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden.</verse>
  <verse number="17">His roots wrap around the rock heap; he looks for a home among the stones.</verse>
  <verse number="18">If he is uprooted from his place, it will disown him, saying, ‘I never saw you.’</verse>
  <verse number="19">Surely this is the joy of his way; yet others will spring from the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Behold, God does not reject the blameless, nor will He strengthen the hand of evildoers.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with a shout of joy.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tent of the wicked will be no more.”</verse>
