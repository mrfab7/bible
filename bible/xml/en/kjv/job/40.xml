<chapter book="Job" number="40" translation="King James Bible" translationID="kjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct [him]? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="7">Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Deck thyself now [with] majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one [that is] proud, and abase him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Look on every one [that is] proud, [and] bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Hide them in the dust together; [and] bind their faces in secret.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Lo now, his strength [is] in his loins, and his force [is] in the navel of his belly.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.</verse>
  <verse number="18">His bones [are as] strong pieces of brass; his bones [are] like bars of iron.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He [is] the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach [unto him].</verse>
  <verse number="20">Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The shady trees cover him [with] their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Behold, he drinketh up a river, [and] hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He taketh it with his eyes: [his] nose pierceth through snares.</verse>
