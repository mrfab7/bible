  <verse number="1">The words of king Lemuel; the oracle which his mother taught him.</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Oh, my son! Oh, son of my womb! Oh, son of my vows!</verse>
  <verse number="3">Don’t give your strength to women, nor your ways to that which destroys kings.</verse>
  <verse number="4">It is not for kings, Lemuel; it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes to say, ‘Where is strong drink?’</verse>
  <verse number="5">lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the justice due to anyone who is afflicted.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Give strong drink to him who is ready to perish; and wine to the bitter in soul:</verse>
  <verse number="7">Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Open your mouth for the mute, in the cause of all who are left desolate.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Open your mouth, judge righteously, and serve justice to the poor and needy.”</verse>
  <verse number="10">Who can find a worthy woman? For her price is far above rubies.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The heart of her husband trusts in her. He shall have no lack of gain.</verse>
  <verse number="12">She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life.</verse>
  <verse number="13">She seeks wool and flax, and works eagerly with her hands.</verse>
  <verse number="14">She is like the merchant ships. She brings her bread from afar.</verse>
  <verse number="15">She rises also while it is yet night, gives food to her household, and portions for her servant girls.</verse>
  <verse number="16">She considers a field, and buys it. With the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard.</verse>
  <verse number="17">She arms her waist with strength, and makes her arms strong.</verse>
  <verse number="18">She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp doesn’t go out by night.</verse>
  <verse number="19">She lays her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.</verse>
  <verse number="20">She opens her arms to the poor; yes, she extends her hands to the needy.</verse>
  <verse number="21">She is not afraid of the snow for her household; for all her household are clothed with scarlet.</verse>
  <verse number="22">She makes for herself carpets of tapestry. Her clothing is fine linen and purple.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Her husband is respected in the gates, when he sits among the elders of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="24">She makes linen garments and sells them, and delivers sashes to the merchant.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Strength and dignity are her clothing. She laughs at the time to come.</verse>
  <verse number="26">She opens her mouth with wisdom. Faithful instruction is on her tongue.</verse>
  <verse number="27">She looks well to the ways of her household, and doesn’t eat the bread of idleness.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Her children rise up and call her blessed. Her husband also praises her:</verse>
  <verse number="29">“Many women do noble things, but you excel them all.”</verse>
  <verse number="30">Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain; but a woman who fears Yahweh, she shall be praised.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Give her of the fruit of her hands! Let her works praise her in the gates!</verse>
