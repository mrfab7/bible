<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="2" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, if you would accept my words, and conceal my commandments within you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">so that your ears may listen to wisdom, then bend your heart in order to know prudence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For if you would call upon wisdom and bend your heart to prudence,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">if you will seek her like money, and dig for her as if for treasure,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">then you will understand the fear of the Lord, and you will discover the knowledge of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For the Lord bestows wisdom, and out of his mouth, prudence and knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He will preserve the salvation of the righteous, and he will protect those who walk in simplicity:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">serving the paths of justice, and guarding the ways of sanctity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then you shall understand justice and judgment, and equity, and every good path.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If wisdom is to enter into your heart, and if knowledge is to become pleasing to your soul,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">then counsel must guard you, and prudence must serve you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">so that you may be rescued from the evil way, and from the man who speaks perversities,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">from those who leave the straight path to walk in dark ways,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">who rejoice when they have done evil, and who exult in the most wicked things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Their ways are perverse, and their steps are infamous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">So may you be rescued from the foreign woman, and from the outsider, who softens her speech,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">and who leaves behind the Guide of her youth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">and who has forgotten the covenant of her God. For her household inclines toward death, and her paths toward Hell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">All those who enter to her will not return again, nor will they take hold of the paths of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">So may you walk in the good way, and keep to the difficult paths of the just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For those who are upright shall live upon the earth, and the simple shall continue upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Yet truly, the impious shall perish from the earth, and those who act unjustly shall be taken away from it.</p>
