  <verse number="1">Now the LORD had said to Abram, Depart from thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, to a land that I will show thee:</verse>
  <verse number="2">And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.</verse>
  <verse number="4">So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken to him, and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed from Haran.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went to go forth into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To thy seed will I give this land: and there he erected an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he removed from thence to a mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he erected an altar to the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Abram journeyed, going on still towards the south.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to dwell there; for the famine was grievous in the land.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it came to pass, when he had come near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:</verse>
  <verse number="12">Therefore it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And it came to pass, that when Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he treated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the LORD afflicted Pharaoh and his house with great plagues, because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done to me? why didst thou not tell me that she is thy wife?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me for a wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.</verse>
