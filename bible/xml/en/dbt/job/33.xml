<chapter book="Job" number="33" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear mine utterances, and hearken to all my words.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Behold now, I have opened my mouth, my tongue speaketh in my palate,</verse>
  <verse number="3">My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart, and my lips shall utter knowledge purely.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</verse>
  <verse number="5">If thou canst, answer me; array [thy words] before me: take thy stand.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Behold, before God I am as thou; I also am formed out of the clay.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, nor my burden be heavy upon thee.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of [thy] words:—</verse>
  <verse number="9">I am clean without transgression; I am pure, and there is no iniquity in me;</verse>
  <verse number="10">Lo, he findeth occasions of hostility against me, he counteth me for his enemy;</verse>
  <verse number="11">He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Behold, I will answer thee in this, thou art not right; for +God is greater than man.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For God speaketh once, and twice,—[and man] perceiveth it not—</verse>
  <verse number="15">In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then he openeth men’s ears, and sealeth their instruction,</verse>
  <verse number="17">That he may withdraw man [from his] work, and hide pride from man.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from passing away by the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and with constant strife in his bones;</verse>
  <verse number="20">And his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty food;</verse>
  <verse number="21">His flesh is consumed away from view, and his bones that were not seen stick out;</verse>
  <verse number="22">And his soul draweth near to the pit, and his life to the destroyers.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his duty;</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then he will be gracious unto him, and say, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.</verse>
  <verse number="25">His flesh shall be fresher than in childhood; he shall return to the days of his youth.</verse>
  <verse number="26">He shall pray unto +God, and he will receive him with favour; and he shall see his face with shoutings, and he will render unto man his righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="27">He will sing before men, and say, I have sinned, and perverted what was right, and it hath not been requited to me;</verse>
  <verse number="28">He hath delivered my soul from going into the pit, and my life shall see the light.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Lo, all these [things] worketh God twice, thrice, with man,</verse>
  <verse number="30">To bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Mark well, Job, hearken unto me; be silent, and I will speak.</verse>
  <verse number="32">If thou hast anything to say, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify thee.</verse>
  <verse number="33">If not, hearken thou unto me; be silent, and I will teach thee wisdom.</verse>
