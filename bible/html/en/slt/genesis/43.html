<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the famine was heavy upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it shall be when they finished eating the grain which they brought from Egypt, their father will say to them, Turn back, buy for us a little food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Judah will speak to him, saying, Protesting, the man protested to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother is with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If thou art sending our brother with us we will go down and will buy food for thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And if thou art not sending, we will not go down, for the man said to us, Ye shall not see my face except your brother is with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Israel will say, For what did ye evil to me to announce to the man to be yet a brother to you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And they will say, Asking, the man asked about us and about our family, saying, Is your father yet living? is there a brother to you? and we announced to him according to the mouth of these words: Knowing, did we know that he will say, Bring down your brother?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Judah will say to Israel his father, Send the youth with me, and we will arise and go; and we shall live and not die, also we, also thou, also our little ones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I will be surety for him; from my hand shalt thou seek him, if I brought him not to thee and set him before thee, I sinned before thee all the days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For unless we lingered we had turned back this twice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Israel their father will say to them, If so now, do this; take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels, and carry down to the man a gift of a little balsam, and a little honey and spice and resin, pistacia nuts, and almonds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And take of twice the silver in your hands; and the silver turned back in the mouth of your sacks, ye shall turn back in your hand; perhaps it was an error.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And take your brother and arise, turn back to the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And God Almighty will give to you mercy before the man, and send you your one brother and Benjamin: and when I was bereaved of children, I was bereaved of children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the men will take this gift, and they took double the silver in their hand, and Benjamin; and they will rise up and go down to Egypt, and they will stand before Joseph.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Joseph will see Benjamin with them, and he will say to him over his house, Bring the men to the house, and slaughter a slaughter, and make ready, for the men shall eat with me at noon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the man will do according to what Joseph said: and the man will bring the men into Joseph’s house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the men will be afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s house; and they will say, For the word of the silver turned back in our sacks at the beginning, we were brought in; to roll himself upon us and to fall upon us and to take us for servants and our asses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And they will come near the man which was over Joseph’s house, and they will say to him at the entrance of the house,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And they will say, With leave my lord, coming down, we came down at the beginning to buy food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And it will be as we came to the lodging place, and we opened our sacks, and behold, the silver of each in the mouth of his sack, our silver in weight: and we turned it back in our hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And other silver we brought down in our hand to buy food: we knew not who put our silver in our sacks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he will say, Peace to you, ye shall not be afraid; your God, and the God of your father, gave to you treasure in your sacks: your silver came to me. And he brought forth to them. Simeon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And the man will bring the men into Joseph’s house, and will give water, and they will wash their feet; and he will give fodder to their asses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And they will make ready the gift at the coming of Joseph at noon: for they heard that they shall eat bread there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And Joseph will come to his house and they will bring to him the gift which is in their hand to the house, and they will worship towards him to the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And he will ask them concerning peace, and he will say, Is it peace to your father, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet living?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And they will say, Peace to thy servant to our father, he is yet living: and they will bow down and worship.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And he will lift up his eyes and see his brother Benjamin, the son of his mother, and he will say, This your little brother of whom ye spake to me? and he will say, God will compassionate thee my son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And Joseph will hasten; for his bowels will move to his brother: and he will seek to weep, and he will go to his store-chamber and will weep there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And he will wash his face and come forth, and will restrain himself, and will say, Place bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And they will set for him alone, and for them alone, and the Egyptians eating with him, alone; for the Egyptians will not be able to eat bread with the Hebrews; for it is abomination to the Egyptians.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And they will set before him, the first-born, according to his seniority, and the small according to his minority: and the men will wonder each at his friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And he will take gifts from before him to them: and Benjamin’s gift will increase above all their gifts, five parts. And they will drink and be intoxicated with him.</p>
