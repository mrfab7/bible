<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">to know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the young man:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">that the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; that the man of understanding may attain to sound counsel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">to understand a proverb, and parables, the words and riddles of the wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of knowledge; but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">My son, listen to your father’s instruction, and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">for they will be a garland to grace your head, and chains around your neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">My son, if sinners entice you, don’t consent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If they say, “Come with us, Let’s lay in wait for blood; let’s lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">let’s swallow them up alive like Sheol, and whole, like those who go down into the pit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">We’ll find all valuable wealth. We’ll fill our houses with spoil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">You shall cast your lot among us. We’ll all have one purse.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">My son, don’t walk in the way with them. Keep your foot from their path,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">for their feet run to evil. They hurry to shed blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For in vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">but these lay wait for their own blood. They lurk secretly for their own lives.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">So are the ways of everyone who is greedy for gain. It takes away the life of its owners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Wisdom calls aloud in the street. She utters her voice in the public squares.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">She calls at the head of noisy places. At the entrance of the city gates, she utters her words:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">“How long, you simple ones, will you love simplicity? How long will mockers delight themselves in mockery, and fools hate knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Turn at my reproof. Behold, I will pour out my spirit on you. I will make known my words to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Because I have called, and you have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one has paid attention;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">but you have ignored all my counsel, and wanted none of my reproof;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I also will laugh at your disaster. I will mock when calamity overtakes you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when your disaster comes on like a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come on you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Then will they call on me, but I will not answer. They will seek me diligently, but they will not find me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">because they hated knowledge, and didn’t choose the fear of Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">They wanted none of my counsel. They despised all my reproof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Therefore they will eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own schemes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For the backsliding of the simple will kill them. The careless ease of fools will destroy them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">But whoever listens to me will dwell securely, and will be at ease, without fear of harm.”</p>
