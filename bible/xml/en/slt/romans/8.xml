  <verse number="1">Therefore now no condemnation to them in Christ Jesus, walking not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus freed me from the law of sin and death.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the impossibility of the law, in that it was weak by the flesh, God having sent his own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:</verse>
  <verse number="4">That the justification of the law be filled up in us, not walking according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For they being according to the flesh mind things of the flesh; and they according to the Spirit the things of the Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For the thought of the flesh, death; and the thought of the Spirit, life and peace.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Wherefore the thought of the flesh enmity to God: for it is not subject to the law of God, for it cannot be.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And they being in the flesh cannot please God.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwell in you. And if any have not the Spirit of Christ, he is not his.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And if Christ in you, truly the body dead by sin; and the Spirit life by justice.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And if the Spirit of him having raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he having raised up Christ from the dead will make alive also your mortal bodies by his Spirit dwelling in you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Therefore, brethren, we are not debtors to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For if ye live according to the flesh, ye shall die: and if by the Spirit ye kill the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For ye have not received the Spirit of servitude again for fear; but have received the Spirit of adoption as a son, in which we cry, Abba, Father.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The Spirit itself testifies with our spirit, that we are children of God:</verse>
  <verse number="17">And if children, also heirs; truly heirs of God, and coheirs of Christ; if indeed we suffer together, that we may be also glorified together.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For I reckon that the sufferings of the time now not worthy of the glory about to be revealed in us.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For the anxious expectation of the creation awaits the revelation of the sons of God.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For the creation was subject to vanity, not voluntarily, but by him having subjected in hope,</verse>
  <verse number="21">That also the creation itself be freed from servitude of corruption to the freedom of the glory of the children of God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For we know that all creation groans together and travails together until now.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And not only, but also they having the first fruits of the Spirit, and we ourselves groan in ourselves, waiting for the adoption as a son, the redemption of our body.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For by hope were we saved: but hope being seen is not hope: for what any one sees, why does he also hope?</verse>
  <verse number="25">And if what we see not, we hope for, by patience we wait.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And likewise also the Spirit takes hold together, and assists our weaknesses: for what we would pray for as we ought, we know not, but the Spirit itself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he searching hearts knows what the thought of the Spirit, for according to God he supplicates for the holy ones.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And we know that to them loving God, all things work together for good, to them being called according to the setting up.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For whom he before knew, he also before determined of the form of the image of his Son, for him to be first born in many brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And whom he before determined, these he also called: and whom he called, these he also justified: and whom he justified, these he also glorified.</verse>
  <verse number="31">What then shall we say to these? if God with us, who against us?</verse>
  <verse number="32">Who truly spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, and how not with him will he freely give us all?</verse>
  <verse number="33">Who shall demand payment for the chosen of God? God justifying.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Who, he condemning Christ having died, and rather also raised again, who is at the right hand of God, and who intercedes for us.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? pressure, or perplexity, or expulsion, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</verse>
  <verse number="36">As has been written, That for thy sake we are killed the whole day; we were reckoned as sheep for slaughter.</verse>
  <verse number="37">But in all these we obtain a complete victory by him having loved us.</verse>
  <verse number="38">For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor beginnings, nor powers, nor things having stood, nor things about to be,</verse>
  <verse number="39">Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creation, shall be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
