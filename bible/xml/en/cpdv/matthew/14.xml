  <verse number="1">In that time, Herod the Tetrarch heard the news about Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he said to his servants: “This is John the Baptist. He has risen from the dead, and that is why miracles are at work in him.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">For Herod had apprehended John, and bound him, and put him in prison, because of Herodias, the wife of his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For John was telling him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">And though he wanted to kill him, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then, on Herod’s birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced in their midst, and it pleased Herod.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And so he promised with an oath to give her whatever she would ask of him.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But, having been advised by her mother, she said, “Give me here, on a platter, the head of John the Baptist.”</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the king was greatly saddened. But because of his oath, and because of those who sat at table with him, he ordered it to be given.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And he sent and beheaded John in prison.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And his head was brought on a platter, and it was given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And his disciples approached and took the body, and they buried it. And arriving, they reported it to Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="13">When Jesus had heard it, he withdrew from there by boat, to a deserted place by himself. And when the crowds had heard of it, they followed him on foot from the cities.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And going out, he saw a great multitude, and he took pity on them, and he cured their sick.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And when evening had arrived, his disciples approached him, saying: “This is a deserted place, and the hour has now passed. Dismiss the crowds, so that, by going into the towns, they may buy food for themselves.”</verse>
  <verse number="16">But Jesus said to them: “They have no need to go. Give them something to eat yourselves.”</verse>
  <verse number="17">They answered him, “We have nothing here, except five loaves and two fish.”</verse>
  <verse number="18">He said to them, “Bring them here to me.”</verse>
  <verse number="19">And when he had ordered the multitude to sit down upon the grass, he took the five loaves and the two fish, and gazing up to heaven, he blessed and broke and gave the bread to the disciples, and then the disciples to the multitudes.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up the remnants: twelve baskets full of fragments.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Now the number of those who ate was five thousand men, besides women and children.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Jesus promptly compelled his disciples to climb into the boat, and to precede him in crossing the sea, while he dismissed the crowds.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And having dismissed the multitude, he ascended alone onto a mountain to pray. And when evening arrived, he was alone there.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But in the midst of the sea, the boat was being tossed about by the waves. For the wind was against them.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then, in the fourth watch of the night, he came to them, walking upon the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And seeing him walking upon the sea, they were disturbed, saying: “It must be an apparition.” And they cried out, because of fear.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And immediately, Jesus spoke to them, saying: “Have faith. It is I. Do not be afraid.”</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then Peter responded by saying, “Lord, if it is you, order me come to you over the waters.”</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he said, “Come.” And Peter, descending from the boat, walked over the water, so as to go to Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Yet truly, seeing that the wind was strong, he was afraid. And as he began to sink, he cried out, saying: “Lord, save me.”</verse>
  <verse number="31">And immediately Jesus extended his hand and took hold of him. And he said to him, “O little in faith, why did you doubt?”</verse>
  <verse number="32">And when they had ascended into the boat, the wind ceased.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Then those who were in the boat drew near and adored him, saying: “Truly, you are the Son of God.”</verse>
  <verse number="34">And having crossed the sea, they arrived in the land of Genesaret.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And when the men of that place had recognized him, they sent into all that region, and they brought to him all who had maladies.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And they petitioned him, so that they might touch even the hem of his garment. And as many as touched it were made whole.</verse>
