<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither hath thy beloved turned him, that we may seek him with thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">My beloved is gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I am my belovedâ€™s, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth his flock among the lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, that lie along the side of Gilead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes, which are come up from the washing; whereof every one hath twins, and none is bereaved among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate behind thy veil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">My dove, my undefiled, is but one; she is the only one of her mother; she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, terrible as an army with banners?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I went down into the garden of nuts, to see the green plants of the valley, to see whether the vine budded, and the pomegranates were in flower.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Or ever I was aware, my soul set me among the chariots of my princely people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Return, return, O Shulammite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. Why will ye look upon the Shulammite, as upon the dance of Mahanaim?</p>
