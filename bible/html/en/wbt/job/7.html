<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of a hireling?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as a hireling looketh for the reward of his work;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro to the dawning of the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken and become lothsome.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">My days are swifter than a weaverâ€™s shuttle, and are spent without hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">O remember that my life is wind: my eye will no more see good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thy eyes are upon me, and I am not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I lothe it; I would not live always: let me alone; for my days are vanity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">What is man, that thou shouldst magnify him? and that thou shouldst set thy heart upon him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And that thou shouldst visit him every morning, and try him every moment?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow my spittle?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I have sinned; what shall I do to thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.</p>
