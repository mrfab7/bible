<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="2" translation="Webster Bible Translation" translationID="wbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same who is made sorry by me?</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I wrote this same to you, lest, coming I should have sorrow from them by whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly to you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But if any hath caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted by many.</verse>
  <verse number="7">So that on the other hand, ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such one should be swallowed up with excessive sorrow.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love towards him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For to this end also I wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.</verse>
  <verse number="10">To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes I forgave it, in the person of Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="11">Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened to me by the Lord,</verse>
  <verse number="13">I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother; but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Now thanks be to God, who always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savor of his knowledge by us in every place.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For we are to God a sweet savor of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</verse>
  <verse number="16">To the one we are the savor of death to death; and to the other the savor of life to life. And who is sufficient for these things?</verse>
  <verse number="17">For we are not as many, who corrupt the word of God: but as from sincerity, but as from God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.</verse>
