  <verse number="1">The book of the lineage of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Abraham conceived Isaac. And Isaac conceived Jacob. And Jacob conceived Judah and his brothers.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Judah conceived Perez and Zerah by Tamar. And Perez conceived Hezron. And Hezron conceived Ram.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Ram conceived Amminadab. And Amminadab conceived Nahshon. And Nahshon conceived Salmon.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Salmon conceived Boaz by Rahab. And Boaz conceived Obed by Ruth. And Obed conceived Jesse.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Jesse conceived king David. And king David conceived Solomon, by her who had been the wife of Uriah.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Solomon conceived Rehoboam. And Rehoboam conceived Abijah. And Abijah conceived Asa.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Asa conceived Jehoshaphat. And Jehoshaphat conceived Joram. And Joram conceived Uzziah.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Uzziah conceived Jotham. And Jotham conceived Ahaz. And Ahaz conceived Hezekiah.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Hezekiah conceived Manasseh. And Manasseh conceived Amos. And Amos conceived Josiah.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Josiah conceived Jechoniah and his brothers in the transmigration of Babylon.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And after the transmigration of Babylon, Jechoniah conceived Shealtiel. And Shealtiel conceived Zerubbabel.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Zerubbabel conceived Abiud. And Abiud conceived Eliakim. And Eliakim conceived Azor.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Azor conceived Zadok. And Zadok conceived Achim. And Achim conceived Eliud.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Eliud conceived Eleazar. And Eleazar conceived Matthan. And Matthan conceived Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Jacob conceived Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And so, all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David to the transmigration of Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the transmigration of Babylon to the Christ, fourteen generations.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Now the procreation of the Christ occurred in this way. After his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they lived together, she was found to have conceived in her womb by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Then Joseph, her husband, since he was just and was not willing to hand her over, preferred to send her away secretly.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But while thinking over these things, behold, an Angel of the Lord appeared to him in his sleep, saying: “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to accept Mary as your wife. For what has been formed in her is of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And she shall give birth to a son. And you shall call his name JESUS. For he shall accomplish the salvation of his people from their sins.”</verse>
  <verse number="22">Now all this occurred in order to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="23">“Behold, a virgin shall conceive in her womb, and she shall give birth to a son. And they shall call his name Emmanuel, which means: God is with us.”</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then Joseph, arising from sleep, did just as the Angel of the Lord had instructed him, and he accepted her as his wife.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he knew her not, yet she bore her son, the firstborn. And he called his name JESUS.</verse>
