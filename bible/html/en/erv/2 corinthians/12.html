<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I must needs glory, though it is not expedient; but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up even to the third heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I know such a man (whether in the body, or apart from the body, I know not; God knoweth),</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">how that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">On behalf of such a one will I glory: but on mine own behalf I will not glory, save in my weaknesses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For if I should desire to glory, I shall not be foolish; for I shall speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any man should account of me above that which he seeth me to be, or heareth from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And by reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations—wherefore, that I should not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, that I should not be exalted overmuch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Concerning this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he hath said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my power is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Wherefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I am become foolish: ye compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I am nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, by signs and wonders and mighty works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For what is there wherein ye were made inferior to the rest of the churches, except it be that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this wrong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be a burden to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But be it so, I did not myself burden you; but, being crafty, I caught you with guile.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Did I take advantage of you by any one of them whom I have sent unto you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? walked we not by the same Spirit? walked we not in the same steps?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Ye think all this time that we are excusing ourselves unto you. In the sight of God speak we in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For I fear, lest by any means, when I come, I should find you not such as I would, and should myself be found of you such as ye would not; lest by any means there should be strife, jealousy, wraths, factions, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">lest, when I come again, my God should humble me before you, and I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore, and repented not of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they committed.</p>
