<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Now I praise you that ye remember me in all things, and hold fast the traditions, even as I delivered them to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head; for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">for neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">for this cause ought the woman to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Judge ye in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto God unveiled?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a dishonor to him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But in giving you this charge, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better but for the worse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and I partly believe it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For there must be also factions among you, that they that are approved may be made manifest among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">When therefore ye assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord’s supper:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">for in your eating each one taketh before other his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">What, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this I praise you not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For I received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, This is my body, which is for you: this do in remembrance of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">In like manner also the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in my blood: this do, as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink the cup, ye proclaim the Lord’s death till he come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Wherefore whosoever shall eat the bread or drink the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner, shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For he that eateth and drinketh, eateth and drinketh judgment unto himself, if he discern not the body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">For this cause many among you are weak and sickly, and not a few sleep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But if we discerned ourselves, we should not be judged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, wait one for another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">If any man is hungry, let him eat at home; that your coming together be not unto judgment. And the rest will I set in order whensoever I come.</p>
