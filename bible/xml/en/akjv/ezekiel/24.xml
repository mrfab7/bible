<chapter book="Ezekiel" number="24" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Son of man, write you the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it:</verse>
  <verse number="4">Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Why thus said the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall on it.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For her blood is in the middle of her; she set it on the top of a rock; she poured it not on the ground, to cover it with dust;</verse>
  <verse number="8">That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood on the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then set it empty on the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.</verse>
  <verse number="12">She has wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.</verse>
  <verse number="13">In your filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged you, and you were not purged, you shall not be purged from your filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest on you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to your ways, and according to your doings, shall they judge you, said the Lord GOD.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="16">Son of man, behold, I take away from you the desire of your eyes with a stroke: yet neither shall you mourn nor weep, neither shall your tears run down.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind the tire of your head on you, and put on your shoes on your feet, and cover not your lips, and eat not the bread of men.</verse>
  <verse number="18">So I spoke to the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the people said to me, Will you not tell us what these things are to us, that you do so?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Then I answered them, The word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="21">Speak to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left shall fall by the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And you shall do as I have done: you shall not cover your lips, nor eat the bread of men.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And your tires shall be on your heads, and your shoes on your feet: you shall not mourn nor weep; but you shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Thus Ezekiel is to you a sign: according to all that he has done shall you do: and when this comes, you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Also, you son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,</verse>
  <verse number="26">That he that escapes in that day shall come to you, to cause you to hear it with your ears?</verse>
  <verse number="27">In that day shall your mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and you shall speak, and be no more dumb: and you shall be a sign to them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
