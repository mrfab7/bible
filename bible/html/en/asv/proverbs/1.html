<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">To know wisdom and instruction; To discern the words of understanding;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">To receive instruction in wise dealing, In righteousness and justice and equity;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; And that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">To understand a proverb, and a figure, The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge; But the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">My son, hear the instruction of thy father, And forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, And chains about thy neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">My son, if sinners entice thee, Consent thou not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If they say, Come with us, Let us lay wait for blood; Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, And whole, as those that go down into the pit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">We shall find all precious substance; We shall fill our houses with spoil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thou shalt cast thy lot among us; We will all have one purse:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">My son, walk not thou in the way with them; Refrain thy foot from their path:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For their feet run to evil, And they make haste to shed blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For in vain is the net spread In the sight of any bird:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And these lay wait for their own blood; They lurk privily for their own lives.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; It taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Wisdom crieth aloud in the street; She uttereth her voice in the broad places;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">She crieth in the chief place of concourse; At the entrance of the gates, In the city, she uttereth her words:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? And scoffers delight them in scoffing, And fools hate knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Turn you at my reproof: Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you; I will make known my words unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Because I have called, and ye have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man hath regarded;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But ye have set at nought all my counsel, And would none of my reproof:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I also will laugh in the day of your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">When your fear cometh as a storm, And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; When distress and anguish come upon you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For that they hated knowledge, And did not choose the fear of Jehovah:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">They would none of my counsel; They despised all my reproof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled with their own devices.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them, And the careless ease of fools shall destroy them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, And shall be quiet without fear of evil.</p>
