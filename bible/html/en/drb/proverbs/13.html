<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A wise son heareth the doctrine of his father: but he that is a scorner, beareth not when he is reproved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Of the fruit of his own mouth shall a man be filled with good things: but the soul of transgressors is wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his soul: but he that hath no guard on his speech shall meet with evils.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The sluggard willeth and willeth not: but the soul of them that work, shall be made fat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The just shall hate a lying word: but the wicked confoundeth, and shall be confounded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Justice keepeth the way of the innocent: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">One is as it were rich, when he hath nothing: and another is as it were poor, when he hath great riches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The ransom of a manâ€™s life are his riches: but he that is poor beareth not reprehension.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The light of the just giveth joy: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whosoever speaketh ill of any thing, bindeth himself for the time to come: but he that feareth the commandment, shall dwell in peace. Deceitful souls go astray in sins: the just are merciful, and shew mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The law of the wise is a fountain of life, that he may decline from the ruin of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Good instruction shall give grace: in the way of scorners is a deep pit.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="21">21Evil pursueth sinners: and to the just good shall be repaid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The good man leaveth heirs, sons, and grandsons: and the substance of the sinner is kept for the just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Much food is in the tillage of fathers: but for others it is gathered with out judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He that spareth the rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him correcteth him betimes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The just eateth and filleth his soul: but the belly of the wicked is never to be filled.</p>
