<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Job also added to this, using figures of speech, and he said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Who will grant to me that I might be as I was in former months, according to the days when God kept watch over me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">At that time, his lamp shined over my head, and by his light, I walked through the darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I was then just as in the days of my youth, when God was privately in my tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">At that time, the Almighty was with me and my children surrounded me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then, I washed my feet with butter, and a boulder poured out rivers of oil for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When I went to the gate of the city, or to the main street, they prepared a chair for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The youths saw me and hid themselves, and the elders, rising up, remained standing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The leaders stopped talking, and they placed a finder over their mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The commanders subdued their voice, and their tongue adhered to their throat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The ear that heard me, blessed me, and the eye that saw me, gave testimony for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">This was because I had freed the poor, who cried out, and the orphan, who had no helper.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The blessing of him who would have been destroyed came upon me, and I consoled the heart of the widow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I put on justice, and I clothed myself with my judgment, like a robe and a diadem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I was an eye for the blind and a foot for the lame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I was the father of the poor; and if I lacked knowledge about any case, I investigated very diligently.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I crushed the jaws of the impious, and I took away prey from his teeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And I said, “I will die in my little nest, and like a palm tree, I will multiply my days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">My root has been spread beside the waters, and the dew will remain with my harvest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My glory will always be restored, and my bow will be restored to my hand.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Those who heard me, expected vindication, and they listened closely in silence to my counsel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">To my words, they dared to add nothing, and my eloquence poured over them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">They waited for me as for rain, and they opened their mouth as for belated rains.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">If I had ever laughed at them, they would not have believed it, and the light of my face was not cast down towards the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If I wished to go to them, I sat down first, and, though I sat like a king surrounded by an army, yet I was a comforter to whose who mourned.</p>
