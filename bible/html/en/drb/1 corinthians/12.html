<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="12" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">NOW concerning spiritual things, my brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">You know that when you were heathens, you went to dumb idols, according as you were led.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man, speaking by the Spirit of God, saith Anathema to Jesus. And no man can say the Lord Jesus, but by the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Now there are diversities of graces, but the same Spirit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And there are diversities of ministries, but the same Lord;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And there are diversities of operations, but the same God, who worketh all in all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto profit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">To one indeed, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom: and to another, the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">To another, faith in the same spirit; to another, the grace of healing in one Spirit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">To another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, the discerning of spirits; to another, diverse kinds of tongues; to another, interpretation of speeches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But all these things one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to every one according as he will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For as the body is one, and hath many members; and all the members of the body, whereas they are many, yet are one body, so also is Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free; and in one Spirit we have all been made to drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For the body also is not one member, but many.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If the foot should say, because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And if the ear should say, because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If the whole body were the eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But now God hath set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And if they all were one member, where would be the body?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But now there are many members indeed, yet one body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the eye cannot say to the hand: I need not thy help; nor again the head to the feet: I have no need of you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Yea, much more those that seem to be the more feeble members of the body, are more necessary.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And such as we think to be the less honourable members of the body, about these we put more abundant honour; and those that are our uncomely parts, have more abundant comeliness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, giving to that which wanted the more abundant honour,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">That there might be no schism in the body; but the members might be mutually careful one for another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And if one member suffer any thing, all the members suffer with it; or if one member glory, all the members rejoice with it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Now you are the body of Christ, and members of member.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And God indeed hath set some in the church; first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly doctors; after that miracles; then the graces of healing, helps, governments, kinds of tongues, interpretations of speeches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all doctors?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Are all workers of miracles? Have all the grace of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But be zealous for the better gifts. And I shew unto you yet a more excellent way.</p>
