<div class="chapter" data-book="Ephesians" data-chapter="5" data-translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" data-translation-id="jps" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Therefore be imitators of God, as His dear children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And live and act lovingly, as Christ also loved you and gave Himself up to death on our behalf as an offering and sacrifice to God, yielding a fragrant odor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But fornication and every kind of impurity, or covetousness, let them not even be mentioned among you, for they ought not to be named among God’s people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Avoid shameful and foolish talk and low jesting—they are all alike discreditable—and in place of these give thanks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For be well assured that no fornicator or immoral person and no money-grubber—or in other words idol-worshipper—has any share awaiting him in the Kingdom of Christ and of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Let no one deceive you with empty words, for it is on account of these very sins that God’s anger is coming upon the disobedient.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Therefore do not become sharers with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">There was a time when you were nothing but darkness. Now, as Christians, you are Light itself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Live and act as sons of Light—for the effect of the Light is seen in every kind of goodness, uprightness and truth—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and learn in your own experiences what is fully pleasing to the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Have nothing to do with the barren unprofitable deeds of darkness, but, instead of that, set your faces against them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">for the things which are done by these people in secret it is disgraceful even to speak of.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But everything can be tested by the light and thus be shown in its true colors; for whatever shines of itself is light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For this reason it is said, “Rise, sleeper; rise from among the dead, and Christ will shed light upon you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Therefore be very careful how you live and act. Let it not be as unwise men, but as wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Buy up your opportunities, for these are evil times.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">On this account do not prove yourselves wanting in sense, but try to understand what the Lord’s will is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Do not over-indulge in wine—a thing in which excess is so easy—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">but drink deeply of God’s Spirit. Speak to one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. Sing and offer praise in your hearts to the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Always and for everything let your thanks to God the Father be presented in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">and submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Married women, submit to your own husbands as if to the Lord;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">because a husband is the Head of his wife as Christ also is the Head of the Church, being indeed the Saviour of this His Body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And just as the Church submits to Christ, so also married women should be entirely submissive to their husbands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Married men, love your wives, as Christ also loved the Church and gave Himself up to death for her;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">in order to make her holy, cleansing her with the baptismal water by the word,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">that He might present the Church to Himself a glorious bride, without spot or wrinkle or any other defect, but to be holy and unblemished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">So too married men ought to love their wives as much as they love themselves. He who loves his wife loves himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For never yet has a man hated his own body. On the contrary he feeds and cherishes it, just as Christ feeds and cherishes the Church;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">because we are, as it were, parts of His Body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">“For this reason a man is to leave his father and his mother and be united to his wife, and the two shall be as one.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">That is a great truth hitherto kept secret: I mean the truth concerning Christ and the Church.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Yet I insist that among you also, each man is to love his own wife as much as he loves himself, and let a married woman see to it that she treats her husband with respect.</p>
