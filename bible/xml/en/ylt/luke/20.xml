  <verse number="1">And it came to pass, on one of those days, as he is teaching the people in the temple, and proclaiming good news, the chief priests and the scribes, with the elders, came upon him,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and spake unto him, saying, ‘Tell us by what authority thou dost these things? or who is he that gave to thee this authority?’</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he answering said unto them, ‘I will question you—I also—one thing, and tell me:</verse>
  <verse number="4">the baptism of John, from heaven was it, or from men?’</verse>
  <verse number="5">And they reasoned with themselves, saying—‘If we may say, From heaven, he will say, Wherefore, then, did ye not believe him?</verse>
  <verse number="6">and if we may say, From men, all the people will stone us, for they are having been persuaded John to be a prophet.’</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they answered, that they knew not whence it was,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and Jesus said to them, ‘Neither do I say to you by what authority I do these things.’</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he began to speak unto the people this simile: ‘A certain man planted a vineyard, and gave it out to husbandmen, and went abroad for a long time,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and at the season he sent unto the husbandmen a servant, that from the fruit of the vineyard they may give to him, but the husbandmen having beat him, did send him away empty.</verse>
  <verse number="11">‘And he added to send another servant, and they that one also having beaten and dishonoured, did send away empty;</verse>
  <verse number="12">and he added to send a third, and this one also, having wounded, they did cast out.</verse>
  <verse number="13">‘And the owner of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my son—the beloved, perhaps having seen this one, they will do reverence;</verse>
  <verse number="14">and having seen him, the husbandmen reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir; come, we may kill him, that the inheritance may become ours;</verse>
  <verse number="15">and having cast him outside of the vineyard, they killed him; what, then, shall the owner of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
  <verse number="16">He will come, and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others.’ And having heard, they said, ‘Let it not be!’</verse>
  <verse number="17">and he, having looked upon them, said, ‘What, then, is this that hath been written: A stone that the builders rejected—this became head of a corner?</verse>
  <verse number="18">every one who hath fallen on that stone shall be broken, and on whom it may fall, it will crush him to pieces.’</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him in that hour, and they feared the people, for they knew that against them he spake this simile.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And, having watched him, they sent forth liers in wait, feigning themselves to be righteous, that they might take hold of his word, to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor,</verse>
  <verse number="21">and they questioned him, saying, ‘Teacher, we have known that thou dost say and teach rightly, and dost not accept a person, but in truth the way of God dost teach;</verse>
  <verse number="22">Is it lawful to us to give tribute to Caesar or not?’</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he, having perceived their craftiness, said unto them, ‘Why me do ye tempt?</verse>
  <verse number="24">shew me a denary; of whom hath it an image and superscription?’ and they answering said, ‘Of Caesar:’</verse>
  <verse number="25">and he said to them, ‘Give back, therefore, the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God;’</verse>
  <verse number="26">and they were not able to take hold on his saying before the people, and having wondered at his answer, they were silent.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And certain of the Sadducees, who are denying that there is a rising again, having come near, questioned him,</verse>
  <verse number="28">saying, ‘Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If any one’s brother may die, having a wife, and he may die childless—that his brother may take the wife, and may raise up seed to his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="29">‘There were, then, seven brothers, and the first having taken a wife, died childless,</verse>
  <verse number="30">and the second took the wife, and he died childless,</verse>
  <verse number="31">and the third took her, and in like manner also the seven—they left not children, and they died;</verse>
  <verse number="32">and last of all died also the woman:</verse>
  <verse number="33">in the rising again, then, of which of them doth she become wife?—for the seven had her as wife.’</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Jesus answering said to them, ‘The sons of this age do marry and are given in marriage,</verse>
  <verse number="35">but those accounted worthy to obtain that age, and the rising again that is out of the dead, neither marry, nor are they given in marriage;</verse>
  <verse number="36">for neither are they able to die any more—for they are like messengers—and they are sons of God, being sons of the rising again.</verse>
  <verse number="37">‘And that the dead are raised, even Moses shewed at the Bush, since he doth call the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;</verse>
  <verse number="38">and He is not a God of dead men, but of living, for all live to Him.’</verse>
  <verse number="39">And certain of the scribes answering said, ‘Teacher, thou didst say well;’</verse>
  <verse number="40">and no more durst they question him anything.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And he said unto them, ‘How do they say the Christ to be son of David,</verse>
  <verse number="42">and David himself saith in the Book of Psalms, The Lord said to my lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</verse>
  <verse number="43">till I shall make thine enemies thy footstool;</verse>
  <verse number="44">David, then, doth call him lord, and how is he his son?’</verse>
  <verse number="45">And, all the people hearing, he said to his disciples,</verse>
  <verse number="46">‘Take heed of the scribes, who are wishing to walk in long robes, and are loving salutations in the markets, and first seats in the synagogues, and first couches in the suppers,</verse>
  <verse number="47">who devour the houses of the widows, and for a pretence make long prayers, these shall receive more abundant judgment.’</verse>
