  <verse number="1">“Brothers and fathers, listen now to my defense before you.”</verse>
  <verse number="2">When they heard him speak to them in Hebrew, they became even more silent. Then Paul declared,</verse>
  <verse number="3">“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but raised in this city. I was educated at the feet of Gamaliel in strict conformity to the law of our fathers. I was just as zealous for God as any of you are today.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I persecuted this Way even to the death, detaining both men and women and throwing them into prison,</verse>
  <verse number="5">as the high priest and the whole Council can testify about me. I even obtained letters from them to their brothers in Damascus, and I was on my way to apprehend these people and bring them to Jerusalem to be punished.</verse>
  <verse number="6">About noon as I was approaching Damascus, suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?’</verse>
  <verse number="8">‘Who are You, Lord?’ I asked. ‘I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting,’ He replied.</verse>
  <verse number="9">My companions saw the light, but they could not understand the voice of the One speaking to me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then I asked, ‘What should I do, Lord?’ ‘Get up and go into Damascus,’ He told me. ‘There you will be told all that you have been appointed to do.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">Because the brilliance of the light had blinded me, my companions led me by the hand into Damascus.</verse>
  <verse number="12">There a man named Ananias, a devout observer of the law who was highly regarded by all the Jews living there,</verse>
  <verse number="13">came and stood beside me. ‘Brother Saul,’ he said, ‘receive your sight.’ And at that moment I could see him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then he said, ‘The God of our fathers has appointed you to know His will and to see the Righteous One and to hear His voice.</verse>
  <verse number="15">You will be His witness to everyone of what you have seen and heard.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And now what are you waiting for? Get up, be baptized, and wash your sins away, calling on His name.’</verse>
  <verse number="17">Later, when I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying at the temple, I fell into a trance</verse>
  <verse number="18">and saw the Lord saying to me, ‘Hurry! Leave Jerusalem quickly, because the people here will not accept your testimony about Me.’</verse>
  <verse number="19">‘Lord,’ I answered, ‘they know very well that in one synagogue after another I imprisoned and beat those who believed in You.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was shed, I stood there giving my approval and watching over the garments of those who killed him.’</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then He said to me, ‘Go! I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’”</verse>
  <verse number="22">The crowd listened to Paul until he made this statement. Then they lifted up their voices and shouted, “Rid the earth of him! He is not fit to live!”</verse>
  <verse number="23">As they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust into the air,</verse>
  <verse number="24">the commander ordered that Paul be brought into the barracks. He directed that Paul be flogged and interrogated to determine the reason for this outcry against him.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But as they stretched him out to strap him down, Paul said to the centurion standing there, “Is it lawful for you to flog a Roman citizen without a trial?”</verse>
  <verse number="26">On hearing this, the centurion went and reported it to the commander. “What are you going to do?” he said. “This man is a Roman citizen.”</verse>
  <verse number="27">The commander went to Paul and asked, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” “Yes,” he answered.</verse>
  <verse number="28">“I paid a high price for my citizenship,” said the commander. “But I was born a citizen,” Paul replied.</verse>
  <verse number="29">At once those who were about to interrogate Paul stepped back, and the commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put a Roman citizen in chains.</verse>
  <verse number="30">The next day the commander, wanting to learn the real reason Paul was accused by the Jews, released him and ordered the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin to assemble. Then he brought Paul down and had him stand before them.</verse>
