<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when you do overtake them, say to them, Why have you rewarded evil for good?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Is not this it in which my lord drinks, and whereby indeed he divines? you have done evil in so doing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And they said to him, Why said my lord these words? God forbid that your servants should do according to this thing:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again to you out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of your lord’s house silver or gold?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">With whomsoever of your servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord’s slaves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he said, Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and you shall be blameless.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And he searched, and began at the oldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Joseph said to them, What deed is this that you have done? know you not that such a man as I can certainly divine?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants: behold, we are my lord’s servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace to your father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh my lord, let your servant, I pray you, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not your anger burn against your servant: for you are even as Pharaoh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">My lord asked his servants, saying, Have you a father, or a brother?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And you said to your servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And we said to my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And you said to your servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, you shall see my face no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And it came to pass when we came up to your servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother be with us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And your servant my father said to us, You know that my wife bore me two sons:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And if you take this also from me, and mischief befall him, you shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Now therefore when I come to your servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">It shall come to pass, when he sees that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and your servants shall bring down the gray hairs of your servant our father with sorrow to the grave.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For your servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I bring him not to you, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Now therefore, I pray you, let your servant abide instead of the lad a slave to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.</p>
