  <verse number="2">And David will say to Abimelech the priest, The king commanded me a word, and he will say to me, A man shall not know any thing of the word for which I sent thee, and what I commanded thee: and the boys I showed to such a place a certain one.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And now what is under thy hand? five of bread thou shalt give into my hand, or that being found.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the priest will answer David and say, No common bread under my hand, but there is consecrated bread; if the boys watched themselves only from women.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And David will answer the priest and say to him, That truly woman was withheld to us for yesterday the third day, in my coming forth, and the vessels of the boys holy, and this way common, and truly if this day it shall be consecrated in the vessel.</verse>
