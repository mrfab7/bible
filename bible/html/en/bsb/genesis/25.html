<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now Abraham had taken another wife, named Keturah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were the Asshurites, the Letushites, and the Leummites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But while he was still alive, Abraham gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son Isaac to the land of the east.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Abraham lived a total of 175 years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And at a ripe old age he breathed his last and died, old and contented, and was gathered to his people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">This was the field that Abraham had bought from the Hittites. Abraham was buried there with his wife Sarah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who lived near Beer-lahai-roi.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">This is the account of Abraham’s son Ishmael, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maidservant, bore to Abraham.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">These are the names of the sons of Ishmael in the order of their birth: Nebaioth the firstborn of Ishmael, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Mishma, Dumah, Massa,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">These were the sons of Ishmael, and these were their names by their villages and encampments—twelve princes of their tribes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Ishmael lived a total of 137 years. Then he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Ishmael’s descendants settled from Havilah to Shur, which is near the border of Egypt as you go toward Asshur. And they lived in hostility toward all their brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">This is the account of Abraham’s son Isaac. Abraham became the father of Isaac,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">and Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan-aram and the sister of Laban the Aramean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Later, Isaac prayed to the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was barren. And the LORD heard his prayer, and his wife Rebekah conceived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But the children inside her struggled with each other, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” So Rebekah went to inquire of the LORD,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">and He declared to her: “Two nations are in your womb, and two peoples from within you will be separated; one people will be stronger than the other, and the older will serve the younger.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">When her time came to give birth, there were indeed twins in her womb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The first one came out red, covered with hair like a fur coat; so they named him Esau.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">After this, his brother came out grasping Esau’s heel; so he was named Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when the twins were born.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">When the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man of the field, while Jacob was a quiet man who stayed at home.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Because Isaac had a taste for wild game, he loved Esau; but Rebekah loved Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">One day, while Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau came in from the field and was famished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red stew, for I am famished.” (That is why he was also called Edom.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">“First sell me your birthright,” Jacob replied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">“Look,” said Esau, “I am about to die, so what good is a birthright to me?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">“Swear to me first,” Jacob said. So Esau swore to Jacob and sold him the birthright.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Then Jacob gave some bread and lentil stew to Esau, who ate and drank and then got up and went away. Thus Esau despised his birthright.</p>
