<div class="chapter" data-book="Ecclesiastes" data-chapter="7" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Better is a name than good perfume, And the day of death than the day of birth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Better to go unto a house of mourning, Than to go unto a house of banqueting, For that is the end of all men, And the living layeth it unto his heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Better is sorrow than laughter, For by the sadness of the face the heart becometh better.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The heart of the wise is in a house of mourning, And the heart of fools in a house of mirth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Better to hear a rebuke of a wise man, Than for a man to hear a song of fools,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For as the noise of thorns under the pot, So is the laughter of a fool, even this is vanity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Surely oppression maketh the wise mad, And a gift destroyeth the heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Better is the latter end of a thing than its beginning, Better is the patient of spirit, than the haughty of spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry, For anger in the bosom of fools resteth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Say not thou, ‘What was it, That the former days were better than these?’ For thou hast not asked wisely of this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Wisdom is good with an inheritance, And an advantage it is to those beholding the sun.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For wisdom is a defense, money is a defence, And the advantage of the knowledge of wisdom is, She reviveth her possessors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">See the work of God, For who is able to make straight that which He made crooked?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">In a day of prosperity be in gladness, And in a day of evil consider. Also this over-against that hath God made, To the intent that man doth not find anything after him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The whole I have considered in the days of my vanity. There is a righteous one perishing in his righteousness, and there is a wrong-doer prolonging himself in his wrong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Be not over-righteous, nor show thyself too wise, why art thou desolate?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Do not much wrong, neither be thou a fool, why dost thou die within thy time?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">It is good that thou dost lay hold on this, and also, from that withdrawest not thy hand, for whoso is fearing God goeth out with them all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The wisdom giveth strength to a wise man, more than wealth the rulers who have been in a city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Because there is not a righteous man on earth that doth good and sinneth not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Also to all the words that they speak give not thy heart, that thou hear not thy servant reviling thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For many times also hath thy heart known that thou thyself also hast reviled others.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">All this I have tried by wisdom; I have said, ‘I am wise,’ and it is far from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Far off is that which hath been, and deep, deep, who doth find it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">I have turned round, also my heart, to know and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and reason, and to know the wrong of folly, and of foolishness the madness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And I am finding more bitter than death, the woman whose heart is nets and snares, her hands are bands; the good before God escapeth from her, but the sinner is captured by her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">See, this I have found, said the Preacher, one to one, to find out the reason</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">(that still my soul had sought, and I had not found), One man, a teacher, I have found, and a woman among all these I have not found.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">See, this alone I have found, that God made man upright, and they—they have sought out many devices.</p>
