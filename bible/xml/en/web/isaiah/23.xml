  <verse number="1">The burden of Tyre. Howl, you ships of Tarshish! For it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in. From the land of Kittim it is revealed to them.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Be still, you inhabitants of the coast, you whom the merchants of Sidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.</verse>
  <verse number="3">On great waters, the seed of the Shihor, the harvest of the Nile, was her revenue. She was the market of nations.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Be ashamed, Sidon; for the sea has spoken, the stronghold of the sea, saying, “I have not travailed, nor brought forth, neither have I nourished young men, nor brought up virgins.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">When the report comes to Egypt, they will be in anguish at the report of Tyre.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Pass over to Tarshish! Wail, you inhabitants of the coast!</verse>
  <verse number="7">Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days, whose feet carried her far away to travel?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Who has planned this against Tyre, the giver of crowns, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Yahweh of Armies has planned it, to stain the pride of all glory, to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Pass through your land like the Nile, daughter of Tarshish. There is no restraint any more.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He has stretched out his hand over the sea. He has shaken the kingdoms. Yahweh has ordered the destruction of Canaan’s strongholds.</verse>
  <verse number="12">He said, “You shall rejoice no more, you oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon. Arise, pass over to Kittim. Even there you will have no rest.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">Behold, the land of the Chaldeans. This people was not. The Assyrians founded it for those who dwell in the wilderness. They set up their towers. They overthrew its palaces. They made it a ruin.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Howl, you ships of Tarshish, for your stronghold is laid waste!</verse>
  <verse number="15">It will come to pass in that day that Tyre will be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king. After the end of seventy years it will be to Tyre like in the song of the prostitute.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Take a harp; go about the city, you prostitute that has been forgotten. Make sweet melody. Sing many songs, that you may be remembered.</verse>
  <verse number="17">It will happen after the end of seventy years that Yahweh will visit Tyre, and she shall return to her wages, and will play the prostitute with all the kingdoms of the world on the surface of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Her merchandise and her wages will be holiness to Yahweh. It will not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise will be for those who dwell before Yahweh, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.</verse>
