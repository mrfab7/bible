<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="6" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Know you not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</verse>
  <verse number="4">If then you have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brothers?</verse>
  <verse number="6">But brother goes to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because you go to law one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?</verse>
  <verse number="8">No, you do wrong, and defraud, and that your brothers.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,</verse>
  <verse number="10">Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortionists, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And God has both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.</verse>
  <verse number="16">What? know you not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, said he, shall be one flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is without the body; but he that commits fornication sins against his own body.</verse>
  <verse number="19">What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?</verse>
  <verse number="20">For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.</verse>
