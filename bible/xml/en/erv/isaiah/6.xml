  <verse number="1">In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Above him stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the foundations of the thresholds were moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</verse>
  <verse number="7">and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I; send me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste,</verse>
  <verse number="12">and the LORD have removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And if there be yet a tenth in it, it shall again be eaten up: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remaineth, when they are felled; so the holy seed is the stock thereof.</verse>
