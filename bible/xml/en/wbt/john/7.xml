  <verse number="1">After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand.</verse>
  <verse number="3">His brethren therefore said to him, Depart hence, and go into Judea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, show thyself to the world.</verse>
  <verse number="5">(For neither did his brethren believe in him.)</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then Jesus said to them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always ready.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify concerning it, that its works are evil.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Go ye up to this feast: I go not yet to this feast, for my time is not yet full come.</verse>
  <verse number="9">When he had said these words to them, he abode still in Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But when his brethren had gone up, then he went also to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</verse>
  <verse number="12">And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, No; but he deceiveth the people.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Yet, no man spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the Jews marveled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</verse>
  <verse number="16">Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">If any man will do his will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God, or whether I speak from myself.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He that speaketh from himself, seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?</verse>
  <verse number="20">The people answered and said, Thou hast a demon: who goeth about to kill thee?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Moses therefore gave to you circumcision, (not because it is from Moses, but from the fathers) and ye on the sabbath circumcise a man.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If a man on the sabbath receiveth circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have restored a man to sound health on the sabbath?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</verse>
  <verse number="26">But lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</verse>
  <verse number="27">But we know this man, whence he is: whereas when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then cried Jesus in the temple, as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</verse>
  <verse number="29">But I know him; for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?</verse>
  <verse number="32">The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him: and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go to him that sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Ye will seek me, and will not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</verse>
  <verse number="36">What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye will seek me, and will not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?</verse>
  <verse number="37">In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirsteth, let him come to me, and drink.</verse>
  <verse number="38">He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</verse>
  <verse number="39">(But this he spoke of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive, for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</verse>
  <verse number="40">Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, In truth this is the Prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Will Christ come out of Galilee?</verse>
  <verse number="42">Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh from the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</verse>
  <verse number="43">So there was a division among the people because of him.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have ye not brought him?</verse>
  <verse number="46">The officers answered, Never man spoke like this man.</verse>
  <verse number="47">Then the Pharisees answered them, Are ye also deceived?</verse>
  <verse number="48">Have any of the rulers, or of the Pharisees believed on him?</verse>
  <verse number="49">But this people who know not the law are cursed.</verse>
  <verse number="50">Nicodemus saith to them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them)</verse>
  <verse number="51">Doth our law judge any man before it heareth him, and knoweth what he doeth?</verse>
  <verse number="52">They answered and said to him, Art thou also from Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="53">And every man went to his own house.</verse>
