<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Of a truth I know it is so; but how can man be just with God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If he shall choose to strive with him, he cannot answer him one thing of a thousand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He is wise in heart and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and had peace?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who removeth mountains, and they know it not, when he overturneth them in his anger;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Who shaketh the earth out of its place, and the pillars thereof tremble;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not, and he sealeth up the stars;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Who alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the high waves of the sea;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the chambers of the south;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who doeth great things past finding out, and wonders without number.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Lo, he goeth by me, and I see [him] not; and he passeth along, and I perceive him not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Behold, he taketh away: who will hinder him? Who will say unto him, What doest thou?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">+God withdraweth not his anger; the proud helpers stoop under him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">How much less shall I answer him, choose out my words [to strive] with him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Whom, though I were righteous, [yet] would I not answer; I would make supplication to my judge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If I had called, and he had answered me, I would not believe that he hearkened to my voice,â€”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He, who crusheth me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He suffereth me not to take my breath, for he filleth me with bitternesses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Be it a question of strength, lo, [he is] strong; and be it of judgment, who will set me a time?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">If I justified myself, mine own mouth would condemn me; were I perfect, he would prove me perverse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Were I perfect, [yet] would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">It is all one; therefore I said, he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If the scourge kill suddenly, he mocketh at the trial of the innocent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The earth is given over into the hand of the wicked [man]; he covereth the faces of its judges. If not, who then is it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And my days are swifter than a runner: they flee away, they see no good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">They pass by like skiffs of reed; as an eagle that swoops upon the prey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my [sad] countenance, and brighten up,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">I am afraid of all my sorrows; I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Be it that I am wicked, why then do I labour in vain?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">If I washed myself with snow-water, and cleansed my hands in purity,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Then wouldest thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes would abhor me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him; that we should come together in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">There is not an umpire between us, who should lay his hand upon us both.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his terror make me afraid,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">[Then] I will speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.</p>
