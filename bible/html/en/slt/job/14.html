<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Man being born of woman is short of days and full of disquiet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And as a flower he will come forth, and will be cut down: and he will flee as a shadow, and shall not stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Also upon this one didst thou open thine eyes? and wilt thou bring Me into judgment with thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For who shall give a clean thing from an unclean? Not one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If his days are determined, the number of his months with thee; thou madest his limit; he shall not pass over.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Look away from him and be shall cease, till he shall delight as an hireling in his day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For there is hope for a tree if it shall be cut down, and it shall yet revive, and its suckers shall not cease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">If its root shall grow old in the earth, and its trunk shall die in the dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">From the smell of water it will break forth, and make foliage as a plant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And man will die and be weak: and man will expire, and where is he?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The waters departed from the sea, and the river will be wasted and dried up;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And man lay down and he will not rise: till the heavens be no more they shall not awake and rise from their sleep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who will give thou wilt hide me in hades? wilt thou cover me till the turning away of thine anger? wilt thou set for me a limit, and wilt thou remember me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If a man die, shall he live? All the days of my warfare I will wait till the coming of my change.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thou shalt call and I will answer thee: thou wilt long for the work of thy hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For now thou wilt count my steps: wilt thou not watch over my sin?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">My transgression is sealed up in a purse, and thou wilt patch upon mine iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And yet the mountain falling shill decay, and the rock shall be removed from its place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The waters rubbed the stones: thou wilt overflow the flowings of the dust of the earth; and thou didst destroy the hope of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Thou wilt overpower him forever, and he will go away: changing his face, thou wilt send him away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His sons will be honored and he knew not: they will be brought low, and he will not understand for them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul upon him shall mourn.</p>
