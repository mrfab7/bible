  <verse number="1">And thou, take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and say, What was thy mother? A lioness: she lay down among lions, she nourished her whelps in the midst of the young lions.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And she brought up one of her whelps; it became a young lion, and he learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the nations heard of him; he was taken in their pit, and they brought him with nose-rings into the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And when she saw that she had waited [and] her hope was lost, she took another of her whelps, [and] made him a young lion.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he went up and down among the lions; he became a young lion, and learned to catch the prey; he devoured men.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he knew their [desolate] palaces, and he laid waste their cities, so that the land was desolate, and all it contained, by the noise of his roaring.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then the nations set against him on every side from the provinces, and spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they put him in a cage with nose-rings, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into strongholds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Thy mother was as a vine, in thy rest, planted by the waters: it was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it had strong rods for sceptres of them that bear rule, and its stature was exalted between the thick boughs; and it was conspicuous by its height with the multitude of its branches.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But it was plucked up in fury, it was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up its fruit; its strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And now it is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground:</verse>
  <verse number="14">and a fire is gone out of a rod of its branches, [which] hath devoured its fruit; so that it hath no strong rod to be a sceptre for ruling. This is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.</verse>
