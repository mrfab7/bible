<div class="chapter" data-book="2 Timothy" data-chapter="2" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Thou therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the things which thou hast heard from me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Suffer hardship with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">No soldier on service entangleth himself in the affairs of this life; that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And if also a man contend in the games, he is not crowned, except he have contended lawfully.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The husbandman that laboreth must be the first to partake of the fruits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Consider what I say; for the Lord shall give thee understanding in all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">wherein I suffer hardship unto bonds, as a malefactor; but the word of God is not bound.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Faithful is the saying: For if we died with him, we shall also live with him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">if we endure, we shall also reign with him: if we shall deny him, he also will deny us:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">if we are faithless, he abideth faithful; for he cannot deny himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they strive not about words, to no profit, to the subverting of them that hear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Give diligence to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, handling aright the word of truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But shun profane babblings: for they will proceed further in ungodliness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">and their word will eat as doth a gangrene: of whom is Hymenæus and Philetus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">men who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already, and overthrow the faith of some.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Howbeit the firm foundation of God standeth, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his: and, Let every one that nameth the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some unto honor, and some unto dishonor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, meet for the master’s use, prepared unto every good work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But flee youthful lusts, and follow after righteousness, faith, love, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But foolish and ignorant questionings refuse, knowing that they gender strifes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And the Lord’s servant must not strive, but be gentle towards all, apt to teach, forbearing,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">in meekness correcting them that oppose themselves; if peradventure God may give them repentance unto the knowledge of the truth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, having been taken captive by him unto his will.</p>
