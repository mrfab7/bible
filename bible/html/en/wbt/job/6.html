<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison of which drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God set themselves in array against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Can that which is unsavory be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then should I yet have comfort; yes, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is my end, that I should prolong my life?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">To him that is afflicted pity should be shown from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and in which the snow is hid:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">In the time when they become warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For now ye are nothing: ye see my casting down, and are afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Did I say, Bring to me? or Give a reward for me of your substance?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Or, Deliver me from the enemyâ€™s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand in what I have erred.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Yes, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident to you if I lie.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yes, return again, my righteousness is in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?</p>
