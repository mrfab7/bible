<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The length of the enclosure a hundred by cubits, and the breadth, fifty by fifty, and the height five cubits of twisted byssus, and the bases brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For all the vessels of the tent in all its work, and all its pegs, and all the pegs of the enclosure, brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And thou shalt command the sons of Israel, and they shall take to thee pure olive oil, beaten for the light, to lift up the light continually.</p>
