  <verse number="2">Unto the hope of life everlasting, which God, who lieth not, hath promised before the times of the world:</verse>
  <verse number="3">But hath in due times manifested his word in preaching, which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior:</verse>
  <verse number="4">To Titus my beloved son, according to the common faith, grace and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Savior.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and shouldest ordain priests in every city, as I also appointed thee:</verse>
  <verse number="6">If any be without crime, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of riot, or unruly.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For a bishop must be without crime, as the steward of God: not proud, not subject to anger, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre:</verse>

  <verse number="13">This testimony is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men, who turn themselves away from the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">All things are clean to the clean: but to them that are defiled, and to unbelievers, nothing is clean: but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.</verse>
  <verse number="16">They profess that they know God: but in their works they deny him; being abominable, and incredulous, and to every good work reprobate.</verse>
