<div class="chapter" data-book="Titus" data-chapter="3" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Admonish them to be subject to princes and powers, to obey at a word, to be ready to every good work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">To speak evil of no man, not to be litigious, but gentle: shewing all mildness towards all men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For we ourselves also were some time unwise, incredulous, erring, slaves to divers desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But when the goodness and kindness of God our Savior appeared:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Not by the works of justice, which we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us, by the laver of regeneration, and renovation of the Holy Ghost;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Whom he hath poured forth upon us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Savior:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">That, being justified by his grace, we may be heirs, according to hope of life everlasting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">It is a faithful saying: and these things I will have thee affirm constantly: that they, who believe in God, may be careful to excel in good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law. For they are unprofitable and vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, avoid:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Knowing that he, that is such an one, is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned by his own judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When I shall send to thee Artemas or Tychicus, make haste to come unto me to Nicopolis. For there I have determined to winter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Send forward Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollo, with care, that nothing be wanting to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And let our men also learn to excel in good works for necessary uses: that they be not unfruitful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All that are with me salute thee: salute them that love us in the faith. The grace of God be with you all. Amen.</p>
