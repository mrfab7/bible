<p class="verse" data-verse="1">He that separateth himself seeketh [his] pleasure, he is vehement against all sound wisdom.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="7">A fool’s mouth is destruction to him, and his lips are a snare to his soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The words of a talebearer are as dainty morsels, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He also who is indolent in his work is brother of the destroyer.</p>
