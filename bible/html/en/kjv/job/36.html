<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Elihu also proceeded, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that [I have] yet to speak on Godâ€™s behalf.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For truly my words [shall] not [be] false: he that is perfect in knowledge [is] with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Behold, God [is] mighty, and despiseth not [any: he is] mighty in strength [and] wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings [are they] on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And if [they be] bound in fetters, [and] be holden in cords of affliction;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If they obey and serve [him], they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">They die in youth, and their life [is] among the unclean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait [into] a broad place, where [there is] no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table [should be] full of fatness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold [on thee].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Because [there is] wrath, [beware] lest he take thee away with [his] stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Will he esteem thy riches? [no], not gold, nor all the forces of strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Every man may see it; man may behold [it] afar off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Behold, God [is] great, and we know [him] not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Which the clouds do drop [and] distil upon man abundantly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Also can [any] understand the spreadings of the clouds, [or] the noise of his tabernacle?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it [not to shine] by [the cloud] that cometh betwixt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.</p>
