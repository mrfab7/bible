1	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2	We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;
3	Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;
4	Knowing, brothers beloved, your election of God.
5	For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.
6	And you became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost.
7	So that you were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
8	For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.
9	For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;
10	And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.
