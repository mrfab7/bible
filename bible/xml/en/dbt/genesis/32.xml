  <verse number="1">And Jacob went on his way; and the angels of God met him.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And when Jacob saw them he said, This is the camp of God. And he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Jacob sent messengers before his face to Esau his brother, into the land of Seir, the fields of Edom.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak to my lord, to Esau: Thy servant Jacob speaks thus—With Laban have I sojourned and tarried until now;</verse>
  <verse number="5">and I have oxen, and asses, sheep, and bondmen, and bondwomen; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favour in thine eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother, to Esau; and he also is coming to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then Jacob was greatly afraid, and was distressed; and he divided the people that were with him, and the sheep and the cattle and the camels, into two troops.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he said, If Esau come to the one troop and smite it, then the other troop which is left shall escape.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Jacob said, God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Jehovah, who saidst unto me: Return into thy country and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good,</verse>
  <verse number="10">—I am too small for all the loving-kindness and all the faithfulness that thou hast shewn unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two troops.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, [and] the mother with the children.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And thou saidst, I will certainly deal well with thee, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he lodged there that night; and took of what came to his hand a gift for Esau his brother—</verse>
  <verse number="14">two hundred she-goats, and twenty he-goats; two hundred ewes, and twenty rams;</verse>
  <verse number="15">thirty milch camels with their colts; forty kine, and ten bulls; twenty she-asses, and ten young asses.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he delivered [them] into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself; and he said to his servants, Go on before me, and put a space between drove and drove.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meets thee, and asks thee, saying, Whose art thou, and where goest thou, and whose are these before thee?</verse>
  <verse number="18">—then thou shalt say, Thy servant Jacob’s: it is a gift sent to my lord, to Esau. And behold, he also is behind us.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, According to this word shall ye speak to Esau when ye find him.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And, moreover, ye shall say, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will propitiate him with the gift that goes before me, and afterwards I will see his face: perhaps he will accept me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the gift went over before him; and he himself lodged that night in the camp.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two maidservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok;</verse>
  <verse number="23">and he took them and led them over the river, and led over what he had.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Jacob remained alone; and a man wrestled with him until the rising of the dawn.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And when he saw that he did not prevail against him, he touched the joint of his thigh; and the joint of Jacob’s thigh was dislocated as he wrestled with him.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And he said, Let me go, for the dawn ariseth. And he said, I will not let thee go except thou bless me.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he said to him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And he said, Thy name shall not henceforth be called Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast wrestled with God, and with men, and hast prevailed.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Jacob asked and said, Tell [me], I pray thee, thy name. And he said, How is it that thou askest after my name? And he blessed him there.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel—For I have seen God face to face, and my life has been preserved.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And as he passed over Peniel, the sun rose upon him; and he limped upon his hip.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Therefore the children of Israel do not eat of the sinew that is over the joint of the thigh, to this day; because he touched the joint of Jacob’s thigh—the sinew.</verse>
