<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on the mount Zion, and with him a hundred and forty and four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and the voice which I heard was as the voice of harpers harping with their harps:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and they sing as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders: and no man could learn the song save the hundred and forty and four thousand, even they that had been purchased out of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among men, to be the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And in their mouth was found no lie: they are without blemish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And I saw another angel flying in mid heaven, having an eternal gospel to proclaim unto them that dwell on the earth, and unto every nation and tribe and tongue and people;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and he saith with a great voice, Fear God, and give him glory; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made the heaven and the earth and sea and fountains of waters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And another, a second angel, followed, saying, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, which hath made all the nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice, If any man worshippeth the beast and his image, and receiveth a mark on his forehead, or upon his hand,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">he also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and the smoke of their torment goeth up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, they that worship the beast and his image, and whoso receiveth the mark of his name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Here is the patience of the saints, they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And I heard a voice from heaven saying, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; for their works follow with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And I saw, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud I saw one sitting like unto a son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And another angel came out from the temple, crying with a great voice to him that sat on the cloud, Send forth thy sickle, and reap: for the hour to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is over-ripe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he that sat on the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And another angel came out from the altar, he that hath power over fire; and he called with a great voice to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Send forth thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vintage of the earth, and cast it into the winepress, the great winepress, of the wrath of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the winepress was trodden without the city, and there came out blood from the winepress, even unto the bridles of the horses, as far as a thousand and six hundred furlongs.</p>
