  <verse number="1">AND Jesus passing by, saw a man, who was blind from his birth:</verse>
  <verse number="2">And his disciples asked him: Rabbi, who hath sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Jesus answered: Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I must work the works of him that sent me, whilst it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</verse>
  <verse number="5">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="6">When he had said these things, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and spread the clay on his eyes,</verse>
  <verse number="7">And said to him: Go, wash in the pool of Siloe, which is interpreted, Sent. He went therefore, and washed, and he came seeing.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The neighbours therefore, and they who had seen him before that he was a beggar, said: Is not this he that sat and begged? Some said: This is he.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But others said: No, but he is like him. But he said: I am he.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They said therefore to him: How were thy eyes opened?</verse>
  <verse number="11">He answered: That man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me: Go to the pool of Siloe, and wash. And I went, I washed, and I see.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they said to him: Where is he? He saith: I know not.</verse>
  <verse number="13">They bring him that had been blind to the Pharisees.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Now it was the sabbath, when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Again therefore the Pharisees asked him, how he had received his sight. But he said to them: He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and I see.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Some therefore of the Pharisees said: This man is not of God, who keepeth not the sabbath. But others said: How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They say therefore to the blind man again: What sayest thou of him that hath opened they eyes? And he said: He is a prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The Jews then did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,</verse>
  <verse number="19">And asked them, saying: Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then doth he now see?</verse>
  <verse number="20">His parents answered them, and said: We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</verse>
  <verse number="21">But how he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: ask himself: he is of age, let him speak for himself.</verse>
  <verse number="22">These things his parents said, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had already agreed among themselves, that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Therefore did his parents say: He is of age, ask himself.</verse>
  <verse number="24">They therefore called the man again that had been blind, and said to him: Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.</verse>
  <verse number="25">He said therefore to them: If he be a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.</verse>
  <verse number="26">They said then to him: What did he to thee? How did he open thy eyes?</verse>
  <verse number="27">He answered them: I have told you already, and you have heard: why would you hear it again? will you also become his disciples?</verse>
  <verse number="28">They reviled him therefore, and said: Be thou his disciple; but we are the disciples of Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="29">We know that God spoke to Moses: but as to this man, we know not from whence he is.</verse>
  <verse number="30">The man answered, and said to them: Why, herein is a wonderful thing, that you know not from whence he is, and he hath opened my eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Now we know that God doth not hear sinners: but if a man be a server of God, and doth his will, him he heareth.</verse>
  <verse number="32">From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard, that any man hath opened the eyes of one born blind.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Unless this man were of God, he could not do any thing.</verse>
  <verse number="34">They answered, and said to him: Thou wast wholly born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Jesus heard that they had cast him out: and when he had found him, he said to him: Dost thou believe in the Son of God?</verse>
  <verse number="36">He answered, and said: Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?</verse>
  <verse number="37">And Jesus said to him: Thou hast both seen him; and it is he that talketh with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And he said: I believe, Lord. And falling down, he adored him.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And Jesus said: For judgment I am come into this world; that they who see not, may see; and they who see, may become blind.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And some of the Pharisees, who were with him, heard: and they said unto him: Are we also blind?</verse>
  <verse number="41">Jesus said to them: If you were blind, you should not have sin: but now you say: We see. Your sin remaineth.</verse>
