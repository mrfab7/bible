  <verse number="1">Now the LORD attended to Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for Sarah what He had promised.</verse>
  <verse number="2">So Sarah conceived and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the very time God had promised.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Abraham gave the name Isaac to the son Sarah bore to him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God had commanded him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then Sarah said, “God has made me laugh, and everyone who hears of this will laugh with me.”</verse>
  <verse number="7">She added, “Who would have told Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne him a son in his old age.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">So the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But Sarah saw that the son whom Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham was mocking her son,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and she said to Abraham, “Expel the slave woman and her son, for the slave woman’s son will never share in the inheritance with my son Isaac!”</verse>
  <verse number="11">Now this matter distressed Abraham greatly because it concerned his son Ishmael.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed about the boy and your maidservant. Listen to everything that Sarah tells you, for through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But I will also make a nation of the slave woman’s son, because he is your offspring.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">Early in the morning, Abraham got up, took bread and a skin of water, put them on Hagar’s shoulders, and sent her away with the boy. She left and wandered in the Wilderness of Beersheba.</verse>
  <verse number="15">When the water in the skin was gone, she left the boy under one of the bushes.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then she went off and sat down nearby, about a bowshot away, for she said, “I cannot bear to watch the boy die!” And as she sat nearby, she lifted up her voice and wept.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Then God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, “What is wrong, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy where he lies.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Get up, lift up the boy, and take him by the hand, for I will make him into a great nation.”</verse>
  <verse number="19">Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. So she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And God was with the boy, and he grew up and settled in the wilderness and became a great archer.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And while he was dwelling in the Wilderness of Paran, his mother got a wife for him from the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="22">At that time Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army said to Abraham, “God is with you in all that you do.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Now, therefore, swear to me here before God that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or descendants. Show to me and to the country in which you reside the same kindness that I have shown to you.”</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Abraham replied, “I swear it.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">But when Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well that Abimelech’s servants had seized,</verse>
  <verse number="26">Abimelech replied, “I do not know who has done this. You did not tell me, so I have not heard about it until today.”</verse>
  <verse number="27">So Abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Abraham separated seven ewe lambs from the flock,</verse>
  <verse number="29">and Abimelech asked him, “Why have you set apart these seven ewe lambs?”</verse>
  <verse number="30">He replied, “You are to accept the seven ewe lambs from my hand as my witness that I dug this well.”</verse>
  <verse number="31">So that place was called Beersheba, because it was there that the two of them swore an oath.</verse>
  <verse number="32">After they had made the covenant at Beersheba, Abimelech and Phicol the commander of his army got up and returned to the land of the Philistines.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called upon the name of the LORD, the Eternal God.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Abraham resided in the land of the Philistines for a long time.</verse>
