<p class="verse" data-verse="1">What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that from now on we should not serve sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For he that is dead is freed from sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dies no more; death has no more dominion over him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For in that he died, he died to sin once: but in that he lives, he lives to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in the lusts thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Neither yield you your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin: but yield yourselves to God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under the law, but under grace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Know you not, that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are to whom you obey; whether of sin to death, or of obedience to righteousness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But God be thanked, that you were the servants of sin, but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Being then made free from sin, you became the servants of righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity to iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness to holiness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For when you were the servants of sin, you were free from righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">What fruit had you then in those things whereof you are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end everlasting life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
