<chapter book="Hosea" number="12" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Ephraim is enjoying wind, And is pursuing an east wind, All the day lying and spoiling he multiplieth, And a covenant with Asshur they make, And oil to Egypt is carried.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And a controversy hath Jehovah with Judah, To lay a charge on Jacob according to his ways, According to his doings He returneth to him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">In the womb he took his brother by the heel, And by his strength he was a prince with God,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Yea, he is a prince unto the Messenger, And he overcometh by weeping, And he maketh supplication to Him, At Bethel He doth find him, And there He doth speak with us,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Even Jehovah, God of the Hosts, Jehovah is His memorial.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And thou, through thy God, dost turn, Kindness and judgment keep thou, And wait on thy God continually.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Canaan! in his hand are balances of deceit! To oppress he hath loved.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Ephraim saith: ‘Surely I have become rich, I have found wealth for myself, All my labours—they find not against me iniquity that is sin.’</verse>
  <verse number="9">And I—Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt, Again do I turn thee back into tents, As in the days of the appointed time.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And I have spoken unto the prophets, And I have multiplied vision, And by the hand of the prophets I use similes.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Surely Gilead is iniquity, Only, vanity they have been, In Gilead bullocks they have sacrificed, Also their altars are as heaps, on the furrows of a field.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Jacob doth flee to the country of Aram, And Israel doth serve for a wife, Yea, for a wife he hath kept watch.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And by a prophet hath Jehovah brought up Israel out of Egypt, And by a prophet it hath been watched.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Ephraim hath provoked most bitterly, And his blood on himself he leaveth, And his reproach turn back to him doth his Lord!</verse>
