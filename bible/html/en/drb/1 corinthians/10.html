<p class="verse" data-verse="1">FOR I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And all in Moses were baptized, in the cloud, and in the sea:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And did all eat the same spiritual food,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And all drank the same spiritual drink; (and they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the desert.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Now these things were done in a figure of us, that we should not covet evil things as they also coveted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Neither become ye idolaters, as some of them, as it is written: The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and there fell in one day three and twenty thousand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Neither let us tempt Christ: as some of them tempted, and perished by the serpents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Neither do you murmur: as some of them murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Now all these things happened to them in figure: and they are written for our correction, upon whom the ends of the world are come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Wherefore he that thinketh himself to stand, let him take heed lest he fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Let no temptation take hold on you, but such as is human. And God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able: but will make also with temptation issue, that you may be able to bear it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Wherefore, my dearly beloved, fly from the service of idols.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I speak as to wise men: judge ye yourselves what I say.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The chalice of benediction, which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ ? And the bread, which we break, is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For we, being many, are one bread, one body, all that partake of one bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Behold Israel according to the flesh: are not they, that eat of the sacrifices, partakers of the altar ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">What then ? Do I say, that what is offered in sacrifice to idols, is any thing ? Or, that the idol is any thing ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But the things which the heathens sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God. And I would not that you should be made partakers with devils.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">You cannot drink the chalice of the Lord, and the chalice of devils: you cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord, and of the table of devils.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy ? Are we stronger than he? All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">All things are lawful for me, but all things do not edify.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Let no man seek his own, but that which is another’s.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat; asking no question for conscience’ sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">If any of them that believe not, invite you, and you will be willing to go; eat of any thing that is set before you, asking no question for conscience’ sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">But if any man say: This has been sacrificed to idols, do not eat of it for his sake that told it, and for conscience’ sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Conscience, I say, not thy own, but the other’s. For why is my liberty judged by another man’s conscience ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">If I partake with thanksgiving, why am I evil spoken of, for that for which I give thanks ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all to the glory of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Be without offence to the Jews, and to the Gentiles, and to the church of God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">As I also in all things please all men, not seeking that which is profitable to myself, but to many, that may be saved.</p>
