  <verse number="1">My spirit will be wasted, my days will be shortened, and only the grave will left for me.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I have not sinned, yet my eye remains in bitterness.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Free me, O Lord, and set me beside you, and let the hand of anyone you wish fight against me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">You have set their heart far from discipline; therefore, they will not be praised.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He promises prey to his companions, but the eyes of his sons will grow faint.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He has posted me like a proverb to the people, and I am an example in their presence.</verse>
  <verse number="7">My eyesight has been clouded by indignation, and my limbs have been reduced, as if to nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The just will be astounded over this, and the innocent will be stirred up against the hypocrite.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the just will cling to his way, and clean hands will increase strength.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore, be converted, all of you, and approach, for I do not find in you any wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="11">My days have passed away; my thoughts have been scattered, tormenting my heart.</verse>
  <verse number="12">They have turned night into day, and I hope for light again after the darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If I should wait, the underworld is my house, and in darkness I have spread out my bed.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I have said to decay and to worms: “You are my father, my mother, and my sister.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">Therefore, where is my expectation now, and who is it that considers my patience?</verse>
  <verse number="16">Everything of mine will descend into the deepest underworld; do you think that, in that place at least, there will be rest for me?</verse>
