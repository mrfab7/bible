<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Shall not wisdom call, and understanding give her voice?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">She stood upon the head of the heights, upon the way of the house of the beaten paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">At the hand of the gates, at the mouth of the city from the coming in of the doors she will cry:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To you, ye men, I shall call, and my voice is to the sons of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Understand craftiness, ye simple: and ye foolish, understand the heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Hear ye, for I will speak dear things; and the openings of my lips uprightnesses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For my palate shall meditate the truth, and evil is the abomination of my lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">In justice are all the sayings of my mouth; nothing in them crooked and perverse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">All of them straight to him understanding, and right to those finding knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Receive my instruction and not silver and knowledge above tried gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For wisdom is good above pearls, and all delights shall not be made equal with her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I wisdom dwelt with prudence, and I shall find the knowledge of machinations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The fear of Jehovah hates evil: pride and haughtiness, and the evil way, and the mouth of perverseness I hated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">To me counsel and wisdom: I am understanding; to me is strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">By me kings shall reign, and princes shall decree justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">By me chiefs shall have dominion, and nobles all judging the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I loved those loving me: and they seeking me shall find me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Riches and honor are with me; splendid riches and justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">My fruit is good above gold, and above pure gold; and my gain above tried silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I shall go in the way of justice, in the midst of the beaten paths of judgment:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">To cause those loving me to inherit existence: and I will fill their treasures.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Jehovah set me up the beginning of his way, before his works from ancient time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">From forever I was knit together, from the beginning, from the first of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">In no depths was I begun; in no fountains abundant in waters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Before the mountains were settled; before the hills I had a beginning:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Yet he made not the earth and the fields, and the head of the clods of the habitable globe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">In his preparing the heavens I was there: in his inscribing a circle upon the face of the deep:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">In his making firm the clouds from above: in his strengthening the fountains of the deep:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">In his setting his law to the sea, and the waters shall not pass by his mouth; in his making firm the foundations of the earth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And I shall be near him the builder, and I shall be a delight of day, day, smiling before him in all time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Smiling in the habitable globe of his earth; and my delight with the sons of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And now ye sons, hear to me: and the happy shall watch my ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Hear ye instructions, and be wise, and ye shall not reject it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Happy the man hearing to me, to watch at my doors day, day; to watch the door posts of my entrances.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">For he finding me, the finding of life, and he shall bring forth acceptance from Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And he sinning against me did violence to his soul: all hating me loved death.</p>
