  <verse number="1">Elihu spoke moreover, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Think you this to be right, that you said, My righteousness is more than God’s?</verse>
  <verse number="3">For you said, What advantage will it be to you? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?</verse>
  <verse number="4">I will answer you, and your companions with you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Look to the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">If you sin, what do you against him? or if your transgressions be multiplied, what do you to him?</verse>
  <verse number="7">If you be righteous, what give you him? or what receives he of your hand?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are; and your righteousness may profit the son of man.</verse>
  <verse number="9">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But none said, Where is God my maker, who gives songs in the night;</verse>
  <verse number="11">Who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth, and makes us wiser than the fowls of heaven?</verse>
  <verse number="12">There they cry, but none gives answer, because of the pride of evil men.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Although you say you shall not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust you in him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But now, because it is not so, he has visited in his anger; yet he knows it not in great extremity:</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore does Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplies words without knowledge.</verse>
