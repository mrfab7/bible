<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I reached an agreement with my eyes, that I would not so much as think about a virgin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For what portion should God from above hold for me, and what inheritance should the Almighty from on high keep?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is not destruction held for the wicked and repudiation kept for those who work injustice?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Does he not examine my ways and number all my steps?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If I have walked in vanity, or if my foot has hurried towards deceitfulness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">let him weigh me in a just balance, and let God know my simplicity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If my steps have turned aside from the way, or if my heart has followed my eyes, or if a blemish has clung to my hands,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">then may I sow, and let another consume, and let my offspring be eradicated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">If my heart has been deceived over a woman, or if I have waited in ambush at my friend’s door,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">then let my wife be the harlot of another, and let other men lean over her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For this is a crime and a very great injustice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">It is a fire devouring all the way to perdition, and it roots out all that springs forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I have despised being subject to judgment with my servant or my maid, when they had any complaint against me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">then what will I do when God rises to judge, and, when he inquires, how will I respond to him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Is not he who created me in the womb, also he who labored to make him? And did not one and the same form me in the womb?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If I have denied the poor what they wanted and have made the eyes of the widow wait;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">if I have eaten my morsel of food alone, while orphans have not eaten from it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">(for from my infancy mercy grew with me, and it came out with me from my mother’s womb;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">if I have looked down on him who was perishing because he had no clothing and the poor without any covering,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">if his sides have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">if I have lifted up my hand over an orphan, even when it might seem to me that I the advantage over him at the gate;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">then may my shoulder fall from its joint, and may my arm, with all its bones, be broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For I have always feared God, like waves flowing over me, whose weight I was unable to bear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">If I have considered gold to be my strength, or if I have called purified gold ‘my Trust;’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">if I have rejoiced over my great success, and over the many things my hand has obtained;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">if I gazed upon the sun when it shined and the moon advancing brightly,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">so that my heart rejoiced in secret and I kissed my hand with my mouth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">which is a very great iniquity and a denial against the most high God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">if I have been glad at the ruin of him who hated me and have exulted that evil found him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">for I have not been given my throat to sin by asking for a curse on his soul;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">if the men around my tabernacle have not said: “He might give us some of his food, so that we will be filled,”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">for the foreigner did not remain at the door, my door was open to the traveler;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">if, as man does, I have hidden my sin and have concealed my iniquity in my bosom;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">if I became frightened by an excessive crowd, and the disrespect of close relatives alarmed me, so that I would much rather have remained silent or have gone out the door;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">then, would he grant me a hearing, so that the Almighty would listen to my desire, and he who judges would himself write a book,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">which I would then carry on my shoulder and wrap around me like a crown?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">With each of my steps, I would pronounce and offer it, as if to a prince.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">So, if my land cries out against me, and if its furrows weep with it,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">if I have used its fruits for nothing but money and have afflicted the souls of its tillers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">then, may thistles spring forth for me instead of grain, and thorns instead of barley. (This ended the words of Job.)</p>
