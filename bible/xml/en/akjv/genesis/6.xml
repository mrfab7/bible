  <verse number="14">Make you an ark of gopher wood; rooms shall you make in the ark, and shall pitch it within and without with pitch.</verse>

  <verse number="16">A window shall you make to the ark, and in a cubit shall you finish it above; and the door of the ark shall you set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shall you make it.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters on the earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But with you will I establish my covenant; and you shall come into the ark, you, and your sons, and your wife, and your sons’ wives with you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shall you bring into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come to you, to keep them alive.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And take you to you of all food that is eaten, and you shall gather it to you; and it shall be for food for you, and for them.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.</verse>
