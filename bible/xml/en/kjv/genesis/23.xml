  <verse number="5">And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,</verse>
  <verse number="6">Hear us, my lord: thou [art] a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead.</verse>
