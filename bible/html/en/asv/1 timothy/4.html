<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Timothy" data-chapter="4" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But the Spirit saith expressly, that in later times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by them that believe and know the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If thou put the brethren in mind of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which thou hast followed until now:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">but refuse profane and old wivesâ€™ fables. And exercise thyself unto godliness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">for bodily exercise is profitable for a little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For to this end we labor and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">These things command and teach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an ensample to them that believe, in word, in manner of life, in love, in faith, in purity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Till I come, give heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Be diligent in these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy progress may be manifest unto all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Take heed to thyself, and to thy teaching. Continue in these things; for in doing this thou shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee.</p>
