<div class="chapter" data-book="Hebrews" data-chapter="8" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The point of what we are saying is this: We do have such a high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and who ministers in the sanctuary and true tabernacle set up by the Lord, not by man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And since every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices, it was necessary for this One also to have something to offer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are already priests who offer gifts according to the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The place where they serve is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Now, however, Jesus has received a much more excellent ministry, just as the covenant He mediates is better and is founded on better promises.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For if that first covenant had been without fault, no place would have been sought for a second.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But God found fault with the people and said: “Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">It will not be like the covenant I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not abide by My covenant, and I disregarded them, declares the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord. I will put My laws in their minds and inscribe them on their hearts. And I will be their God, and they will be My people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">No longer will each one teach his neighbor or his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ because they will all know Me, from the least of them to the greatest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For I will forgive their iniquities and will remember their sins no more.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">By speaking of a new covenant, He has made the first one obsolete; and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear.</p>
