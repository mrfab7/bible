  <verse number="1">And so Jacob, setting out, arrived in the eastern land.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he saw a well in a field, and also three flocks of sheep reclining near it. For the animals were watered from it, and its mouth was closed with a great stone.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the custom was, when all the sheep were gathered together, to roll away the stone. And when the flocks had been refreshed, they placed it over the mouth of the well again.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he said to the shepherds, “Brothers, where are you from?” And they answered. “From Haran.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">And questioning them, he said, “Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?” They said, “We know him.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">He said, “Is he well?” “He is very well,” they said. “And behold, his daughter Rachel approaches with his flock.”</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Jacob said, “There is still much daylight remaining, and it is not time to return the flocks to the sheepfold. Give the sheep to drink first, and then lead them back to pasture.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">They responded, “We cannot, until all the animals are gathered together and we remove the stone from the mouth of the well, so that we may water the flocks.”</verse>
  <verse number="9">They were still speaking, and behold, Rachel arrived with her father’s sheep; for she pastured the flock.</verse>
  <verse number="10">When Jacob had seen her, and he realized that she was his maternal first cousin, and that these were the sheep of his uncle Laban, he removed the stone which closed the well.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And having watered the flock, he kissed her. And lifting up his voice, he wept.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he revealed to her that he was a brother of her father, and the son of Rebekah. And so, hurrying, she announced it to her father.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And when he had heard that Jacob, his sister’s son, had arrived, he ran to meet him. And embracing him, and kissing him heartily, he brought him into his house. But when he had heard the reasons for his journey,</verse>
  <verse number="14">he responded, “You are my bone and my flesh.” And after the days of one month were completed,</verse>
  <verse number="15">he said to him: “Though you are my brother, will you serve me for nothing? Tell me what wages you would accept.”</verse>
  <verse number="16">In truth, he had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah; and truly the younger was called Rachel.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But while Leah was bleary-eyed, Rachel had an elegant appearance and was attractive to behold.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Jacob, loving her, said, “I will serve you for seven years, for your younger daughter Rachel.”</verse>
  <verse number="19">Laban responded, “It is better that I give her to you than to another man; remain with me.”</verse>
  <verse number="20">Therefore, Jacob served for seven years for Rachel. And these seemed like only a few days, because of the greatness of love.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he said to Laban, “Give my wife to me. For now the time has been fulfilled, so that I may go in to her.”</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he, having called a great crowd of his friends to the feast, agreed to the marriage.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And at night, he brought in his daughter Leah to him,</verse>
  <verse number="24">giving his daughter a handmaid named Zilpah. After Jacob had gone in to her, according to custom, when morning had arrived, he saw Leah.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he said to his father-in-law, “What is it that you intended to do? Did I not serve you for Rachel? Why have you deceived me?”</verse>
  <verse number="26">Laban responded, “It is not the practice in this place to give the younger in marriage first.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Complete a week of days with this mating. And then I will give this one to you also, for the service that you will provide to me for another seven years.”</verse>
  <verse number="28">He agreed to his pleading. And after the week had passed, he took Rachel as a wife.</verse>
  <verse number="29">To her, the father had given Bilhah as her servant.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And, having at last obtained the marriage he desired, he preferred the love of the latter before the former, and he served with him another seven years.</verse>
  <verse number="31">But the Lord, seeing that he despised Leah, opened her womb, but her sister remained barren.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Having conceived, she gave birth to a son, and she called his name Reuben, saying: “The Lord saw my humiliation; now my husband will love me.”</verse>
  <verse number="33">And again she conceived and bore a son, and she said, “Because the Lord heard that I was treated with contempt, he has also given this one to me.” And she called his name Simeon.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And she conceived a third time, and she gave birth to another son, and she said: “Now likewise my husband will unite with me, because I have borne him three sons.” And because of this, she called his name Levi.</verse>
  <verse number="35">A fourth time she conceived and bore a son, and she said, “Only now will I confess to the Lord.” And for this reason, she called him Judah. And she ceased from child-bearing.</verse>
