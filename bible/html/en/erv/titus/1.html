<div class="chapter" data-book="Titus" data-chapter="1" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">in hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before times eternal;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">but in his own seasons manifested his word in the message, wherewith I was intrusted according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">to Titus, my true child after a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that were wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave thee charge;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children that believe, who are not accused of riot or unruly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For the bishop must be blameless, as God’s steward; not selfwilled, not soon angry, no brawler, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">but given to hospitality, a lover of good, soberminded, just, holy, temperate;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able both to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict the gainsayers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For there are many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are alway liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">This testimony is true. For which cause reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">They profess that they know God; but by their works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</p>
