<chapter book="Hosea" number="9" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">‘Rejoice not, O Israel, be not joyful like the peoples, For thou hast gone a-whoring from thy God, Thou hast loved a gift near all floors of corn.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Floor and wine-press do not delight them, And new wine doth fail in her,</verse>
  <verse number="3">They do not abide in the land of Jehovah, And turned back hath Ephraim to Egypt, And in Asshur an unclean thing they eat.</verse>
  <verse number="4">They pour not out wine to Jehovah, Nor are they sweet to Him, Their sacrifices are as bread of mourners to them, All eating it are unclean: For their bread is for themselves, It doth not come into the house of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="5">What do ye at the day appointed? And at the day of Jehovah’s festival?</verse>
  <verse number="6">For, lo, they have gone because of destruction, Egypt gathereth them, Moph burieth them, The desirable things of their silver, Nettles possess them—a thorn is in their tents.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Come in have the days of inspection, Come in have the days of recompence, Israel doth know! a fool is the prophet, Mad is the man of the Spirit, Because of the abundance of thine iniquity, And great is the hatred.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Ephraim is looking away from My God, The prophet! a snare of a fowler is over all his ways, Hatred is in the house of his God.</verse>
  <verse number="9">They have gone deep—have done corruptly, As in the days of Gibeah, He doth remember their iniquity, He doth inspect their sins.</verse>
  <verse number="10">As grapes in a wilderness I found Israel, As the first-fruit in a fig-tree, at its beginning, I have seen your fathers, They—they have gone in to Baal-Peor, And are separated to a shameful thing, And are become abominable like their love.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Ephraim is as a fowl, Fly away doth their honour, without birth, And without womb, and without conception.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For though they nourish their sons, I have made them childless—without man, Surely also, woe to them, when I turn aside from them.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Ephraim! when I have looked to the rock, Is planted in comeliness, And Ephraim is to bring out unto a slayer his sons.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Give to them, Jehovah—what dost Thou give? Give to them miscarrying womb, and dry breasts.</verse>
  <verse number="15">All their evil is in Gilgal, Surely there I have hated them, Because of the evil of their doings, Out of My house I do drive them, I add not to love them, all their heads are apostates.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Ephraim hath been smitten, Their root hath dried up, fruit they yield not, Yea, though they bring forth, I have put to death the desired of their womb.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Reject them doth my God, Because they have not hearkened to Him, And they are wanderers among nations!</verse>
