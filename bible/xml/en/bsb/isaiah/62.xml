  <verse number="1">For Zion’s sake I will not keep silent, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not keep still, until her righteousness shines like a bright light, her salvation like a blazing torch.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Nations will see your righteousness, and all kings your glory. You will be called by a new name that the mouth of the LORD will bestow.</verse>
  <verse number="3">You will be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, a royal diadem in the palm of your God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">No longer will you be called Forsaken, nor your land named Desolate; but you will be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah; for the LORD will take delight in you, and your land will be His bride.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For as a young man marries a young woman, so your sons will marry you; and as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride, so your God will rejoice over you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">On your walls, O Jerusalem, I have posted watchmen; they will never be silent day or night. You who call on the LORD shall take no rest for yourselves,</verse>
  <verse number="7">nor give Him any rest until He establishes Jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The LORD has sworn by His right hand and by His mighty arm: “Never again will I give your grain to your enemies for food, nor will foreigners drink the new wine for which you have toiled.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For those who harvest grain will eat it and praise the LORD, and those who gather grapes will drink the wine in My holy courts.”</verse>
  <verse number="10">Go out, go out through the gates; prepare the way for the people! Build it up, build up the highway; clear away the stones; raise a banner for the nations!</verse>
  <verse number="11">Behold, the LORD has proclaimed to the ends of the earth, “Say to Daughter Zion: See, your Savior comes! Look, His reward is with Him, and His recompense goes before Him.”</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they will be called the Holy People, the Redeemed of The LORD; and you will be called Sought Out, A City Not Forsaken.</verse>
