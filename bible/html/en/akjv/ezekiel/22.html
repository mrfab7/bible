<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Now, you son of man, will you judge, will you judge the bloody city? yes, you shall show her all her abominations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then say you, Thus said the Lord GOD, The city sheds blood in the middle of it, that her time may come, and makes idols against herself to defile herself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">You are become guilty in your blood that you have shed; and have defiled yourself in your idols which you have made; and you have caused your days to draw near, and are come even to your years: therefore have I made you a reproach to the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Those that be near, and those that be far from you, shall mock you, which are infamous and much vexed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in you to their power to shed blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In you have they set light by father and mother: in the middle of you have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in you have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">You have despised my holy things, and have profaned my sabbaths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">In you are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in you they eat on the mountains: in the middle of you they commit lewdness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">In you have they discovered their fathers’ nakedness: in you have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And one has committed abomination with his neighbor’s wife; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in you has humbled his sister, his father’s daughter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">In you have they taken gifts to shed blood; you have taken usury and increase, and you have greedily gained of your neighbors by extortion, and have forgotten me, said the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Behold, therefore I have smitten my hand at your dishonest gain which you have made, and at your blood which has been in the middle of you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Can your heart endure, or can your hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with you? I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And I will scatter you among the heathen, and disperse you in the countries, and will consume your filthiness out of you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And you shall take your inheritance in yourself in the sight of the heathen, and you shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the middle of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Because you are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the middle of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the middle of the furnace, to blow the fire on it, to melt it; so will I gather you in my anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Yes, I will gather you, and blow on you in the fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted in the middle therof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">As silver is melted in the middle of the furnace, so shall you be melted in the middle thereof; and you shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury on you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Son of man, say to her, You are the land that is not cleansed, nor rained on in the day of indignation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the middle thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the middle thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned my holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they showed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Her princes in the middle thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And her prophets have daubed them with untempered mortar, seeing vanity, and divining lies to them, saying, Thus said the Lord GOD, when the LORD has not spoken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yes, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Therefore have I poured out my indignation on them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed on their heads, said the Lord GOD.</p>
