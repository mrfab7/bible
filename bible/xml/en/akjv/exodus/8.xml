  <verse number="1">And the LORD spoke to Moses, Go to Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus said the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And if you refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all your borders with frogs:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into your house, and into your bedchamber, and on your bed, and into the house of your servants, and on your people, and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs:</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the frogs shall come up both on you, and on your people, and on all your servants.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch forth your hand with your rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the LORD, that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people; and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Moses said to Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I entreat for you, and for your servants, and for your people, to destroy the frogs from you and your houses, that they may remain in the river only?</verse>
  <verse number="10">And he said, To morrow. And he said, Be it according to your word: that you may know that there is none like to the LORD our God.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the frogs shall depart from you, and from your houses, and from your servants, and from your people; they shall remain in the river only.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried to the LORD because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And they gathered them together on heaps: and the land stank.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and listened not to them; as the LORD had said.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the LORD said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out your rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man, and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice on man, and on beast.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he listened not to them; as the LORD had said.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the LORD said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; see, he comes forth to the water; and say to him, Thus said the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies on you, and on your servants, and on your people, and into your houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground where on they are.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end you may know that I am the LORD in the middle of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And I will put a division between my people and your people: to morrow shall this sign be.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the LORD did so; and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants’ houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go you, sacrifice to your God in the land.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: see, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?</verse>
  <verse number="27">We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God, as he shall command us.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away: entreat for me.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Moses said, Behold, I go out from you, and I will entreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go.</verse>
