<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then the whole council rose and led Jesus away to Pilate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And they began to accuse Him, saying, “We found this man subverting our nation, forbidding payment of taxes to Caesar, and proclaiming Himself to be Christ, a King.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">So Pilate asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” “You have said so,” Jesus replied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But they kept insisting, “He stirs up the people all over Judea with His teaching. He began in Galilee and has come all the way here.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When Pilate heard this, he asked if the man was a Galilean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And learning that Jesus was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who himself was in Jerusalem at that time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">When Herod saw Jesus, he was greatly pleased. He had wanted to see Him for a long time, because he had heard about Him and was hoping to see Him perform a miracle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Herod questioned Jesus at great length, but He gave no answer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Meanwhile, the chief priests and scribes stood there, vehemently accusing Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And even Herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked Him. Dressing Him in a fine robe, they sent Him back to Pilate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">That day Herod and Pilate became friends; before this time they had been enemies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Then Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion. I have examined Him here in your presence and found Him not guilty of your charges against Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Neither has Herod, for he sent Him back to us. As you can see, He has done nothing deserving of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Therefore I will punish Him and release Him.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17"></p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But they all cried out in unison: “Away with this man! Release Barabbas to us!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">(Barabbas had been imprisoned for an insurrection in the city, and for murder.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Wanting to release Jesus, Pilate addressed them again,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">but they kept shouting, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A third time he said to them, “What evil has this man done? I have found in Him no offense worthy of death. So after I punish Him, I will release Him.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices for Jesus to be crucified. And their clamor prevailed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">So Pilate sentenced that their demand be met.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">As they had requested, he released the one imprisoned for insurrection and murder, and he handed Jesus over to their will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">As the soldiers led Him away, they seized Simon of Cyrene on his way in from the country, and they put the cross on him to carry behind Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">A great number of people followed Him, including women who kept mourning and wailing for Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">But Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Look, the days are coming when people will say, ‘Blessed are the barren women, the wombs that never bore, and breasts that never nursed!’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">At that time ‘they will say to the mountains, “Fall on us!” and to the hills, “Cover us!”’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For if men do these things while the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Two others, who were criminals, were also led away to be executed with Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">When they came to the place called The Skull, they crucified Him there, along with the criminals, one on His right and the other on His left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” And they divided up His garments by casting lots.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">The people stood watching, and the rulers sneered at Him, saying, “He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ of God, the Chosen One.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">The soldiers also mocked Him and came up to offer Him sour wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">“If You are the King of the Jews,” they said, “save Yourself!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">Above Him was posted an inscription: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">One of the criminals who hung there heaped abuse on Him. “Are You not the Christ?” he said. “Save Yourself and us!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">But the other one rebuked him, saying, “Do you not even fear God, since you are under the same judgment?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">We are punished justly, for we are receiving what our actions deserve. But this man has done nothing wrong.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when You come into Your kingdom!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And Jesus said to him, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with Me in Paradise.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn down the middle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">Then Jesus called out in a loud voice, “Father, into Your hands I commit My Spirit.” And when He had said this, He breathed His last.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">When the centurion saw what had happened, he gave glory to God, saying, “Surely this was a righteous man.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">And when all the people who had gathered for this spectacle saw what had happened, they returned home beating their breasts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">But all those who knew Jesus, including the women who had followed Him from Galilee, stood at a distance watching these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">Now there was a Council member named Joseph, a good and righteous man,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">who had not consented to their decision or action. He was from the Judean town of Arimathea and was waiting for the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">He went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and placed it in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had yet been laid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">It was Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was beginning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">The women who had come with Jesus from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how His body was placed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">Then they returned to prepare spices and perfumes. And they rested on the Sabbath, according to the commandment.</p>
