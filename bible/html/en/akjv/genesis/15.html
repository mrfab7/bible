<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am your shield, and your exceeding great reward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Abram said, LORD God, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Abram said, Behold, to me you have given no seed: and, see, one born in my house is my heir.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And, behold, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, This shall not be your heir; but he that shall come forth out of your own bowels shall be your heir.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if you be able to number them: and he said to him, So shall your seed be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he said to him, I am the LORD that brought you out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he said to him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he took to him all these, and divided them in the middle, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And when the fowls came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram; and, see, an horror of great darkness fell on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And he said to Abram, Know of a surety that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried in a good old age.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But in the fourth generation they shall come here again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To your seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.</p>
