<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Shall he that reproveth contend with the Almighty? He that argueth with God, let him answer it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then Job answered the LORD, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer Thee? I lay my hand upon my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Once have I spoken, but I will not answer again; Yea, twice, but I will proceed no further.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Gird up thy loins now like a man; I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Wilt thou even make void My judgment? Wilt thou condemn Me, that thou mayest be justified?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Or hast thou an arm like God? And canst thou thunder with a voice like Him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency, And array thyself with glory and beauty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath; And look upon every one that is proud, and abase him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; And tread down the wicked in their place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hide them in the dust together; Bind their faces in the hidden place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then will I also confess unto thee That thine own right hand can save thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; He eateth grass as an ox.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Lo now, his strength is in his loins, And his force is in the stays of his body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He straineth his tail like a cedar; The sinews of his thighs are knit together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">His bones are as pipes of brass; His gristles are like bars of iron.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He is the beginning of the ways of God; He only that made him can make His sword to approach unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Surely the mountains bring him forth food, And all the beasts of the field play there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He lieth under the lotus-trees, In the covert of the reed, and fens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The lotus-trees cover him with their shadow; The willows of the brook compass him about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not; He is confident, though the Jordan rush forth to his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Shall any take him by his eyes, Or pierce through his nose with a snare?</p>
