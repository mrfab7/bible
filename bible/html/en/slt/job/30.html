<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And now the younger than I laughed upon me, which I rejected their fathers to set with the dogs of my flock.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Also the strength of their hands wherefore to me? Upon them old age perished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">In want and in hunger, barren, gnawing the dry land, yesternight desolation and burning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Plucking off sea purslain upon the shrub, the root of broom their bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">They shall be driven forth from the midst, they shall cry after them as a thief:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">To dwell in the horror of the valleys, holes of the dust, and the rocks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Between the shrubs they will bray; they will be poured out under the thorn bush.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The sons of the foolish one, also the sons of no name: they were beaten from the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And now I was their song, and I to them for a by word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They abhorred me, they removed far from me, and withheld not spittle from my face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Because he loosed his cord and he will afflict me, and they cast off the bridle from before me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Upon the right the brood will rise up; they cast away my feet, and they will cast up the paths of their destruction against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They tore up my beaten path, they helped for my fall, no help to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">They will come as a wide breach under a destroying tempest, they rolled themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Terror turned upon me, it will pursue my willingness as the wind, and my salvation passed away as a cloud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And now my soul shall be poured out upon me; and the days of affliction will hold me fast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The night my bones pierced from above me, and my gnawers will not lie down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">By the multitude of power my clothing will be disguised: it will gird me about as the mouth of my coat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He cast me to the clay; I shall become like as dust and ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I shall cry to thee and thou wilt not answer me: I stood up and thou wilt not attend to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Thou wilt turn to be cruel to me: with the strength of thy hand thou wilt lie in wait for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Thou wilt lift me up to the wind; thou wilt cause me to ride, and thou wilt melt to me counsel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For I knew thou wilt turn me back to death, and the house appointed to all living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But prayer is nothing; he will send forth the hand, if in his calamity to them a cry for help.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If I wept not for him being hard of day: my soul was grieved for the needy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For I hoped for good and evil will come: and I shall wait for light and darkness will come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">My bowels boiled, and were not silent: the days of affliction anticipated me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">I went darkened without warmth: I rose up, I shall cry in the convocation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">I was a brother to jackals, and a companion to the daughters of the ostrich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">My skin was black from above me, and my bones burnt from heat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And my harp will be for mourning, and my pipe for the voice of those weeping.</p>
