  <verse number="1">Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take to him my two sons to be slaves.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for you? tell me, what have you in the house? And she said, Your handmaid has not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then he said, Go, borrow you vessels abroad of all your neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And when you are come in, you shall shut the door on you and on your sons, and shall pour out into all those vessels, and you shall set aside that which is full.</verse>
  <verse number="5">So she went from him, and shut the door on her and on her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said to her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt, and live you and your children of the rest.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passes by us continually.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Let us make a little chamber, I pray you, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in thither.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, you have been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for you? would you be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among my own people.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Truly she has no child, and her husband is old.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, you shall embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your handmaid.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season that Elisha had said to her, according to the time of life.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And he said to his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door on him, and went out.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And she called to her husband, and said, Send me, I pray you, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he said, Why will you go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not your riding for me, except I bid you.</verse>
  <verse number="25">So she went and came to the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:</verse>
  <verse number="26">Run now, I pray you, to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with you? is it well with your husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well:</verse>
  <verse number="27">And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD has hid it from me, and has not told me.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?</verse>
  <verse number="29">Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go your way: if you meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute you, answer him not again: and lay my staff on the face of the child.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And the mother of the child said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And he arose, and followed her.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Why he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid on his bed.</verse>
  <verse number="33">He went in therefore, and shut the door on them two, and prayed to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And he went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands: and stretched himself on the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself on him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in to him, he said, Take up your son.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Then she went in, and fell at his feet, and bowed herself to the ground, and took up her son, and went out.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And Elisha came again to Gilgal: and there was a dearth in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him: and he said to his servant, Set on the great pot, and seethe pottage for the sons of the prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And one went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine, and gathered thereof wild gourds his lap full, and came and shred them into the pot of pottage: for they knew them not.</verse>
  <verse number="40">So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of the pottage, that they cried out, and said, O you man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="41">But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot; and he said, Pour out for the people, that they may eat. And there was no harm in the pot.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And there came a man from Baalshalisha, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of corn in the husk thereof. And he said, Give to the people, that they may eat.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And his servitor said, What, should I set this before an hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat: for thus said the LORD, They shall eat, and shall leave thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="44">So he set it before them, and they did eat, and left thereof, according to the word of the LORD.</verse>
