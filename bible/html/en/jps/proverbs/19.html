<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity Than he that is perverse in his lips and a fool at the same time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Also, that the soul be without knowledge is not good; And he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The foolishness of man perverteth his way; And his heart fretteth against the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Wealth addeth many friends; But as for the poor, his friend separateth himself from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A false witness shall not be unpunished; And he that breatheth forth lies shall not escape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Many will entreat the favour of the liberal man; And every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All the brethren of the poor do hate him; How much more do his friends go far from him! He that pursueth words, they turn against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul; He that keepeth understanding shall find good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A false witness shall not be unpunished; And he that breatheth forth lies shall perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Luxury is not seemly for a fool; Much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">It is the discretion of a man to be slow to anger, And it is his glory to pass over a transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion; But his favour is as dew upon the grass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A foolish son is the calamity of his father; And the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">House and riches are the inheritance of fathers; But a prudent wife is from the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; And the idle soul shall suffer hunger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his soul; But he that despiseth His ways shall die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He that is gracious unto the poor lendeth unto the LORD; And his good deed will He repay unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Chasten thy son, for there is hope; But set not thy heart on his destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment; For if thou interpose, thou wilt add thereto.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Hear counsel, and receive instruction, That thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">There are many devices in a man’s heart; But the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The lust of a man is his shame; And a poor man is better than a liar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The fear of the LORD tendeth to life; And he that hath it shall abide satisfied, He shall not be visited with evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish, And will not so much as bring it back to his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">When thou smitest a scorner, the simple will become prudent; And when one that hath understanding is reproved, he will understand knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">A son that dealeth shamefully and reproachfully Will despoil his father, and chase away his mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Cease, my son, to hear the instruction That causeth to err from the words of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">An ungodly witness mocketh at right; And the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Judgments are prepared for scorners, And stripes for the back of fools.</p>
