<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land of Canaan, this shall be the land that shall fall to you for an inheritance, the land of Canaan according to the borders thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then your south side shall be from the wilderness of Zin alongside of Edom, and your southern border shall be from the end of the salt sea eastward;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and your border shall turn from the south of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin, and shall end southward at Kadesh-barnea, and shall go on to Hazar-Addar, and pass on to Azmon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the border shall turn from Azmon unto the torrent of Egypt, and shall end at the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And as west border ye shall have the great sea, and [its] coast. This shall be your west border.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall mark out for you mount Hor;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">from mount Hor ye shall mark out the entrance to Hamath, and the end of the border shall be toward Zedad;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and the border shall go to Ziphron, and shall end at Hazar-enan. This shall be your north border.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And ye shall mark out for you as eastern border from Hazar-enan to Shepham:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall strike upon the extremity of the sea of Chinnereth eastward;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">and the border shall go down to the Jordan, and shall end at the salt sea. This shall be your land according to the borders thereof round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall take for yourselves as inheritance by lot, which Jehovah commanded to give to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">These are the names of the men who shall divide the land unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land.</p>
