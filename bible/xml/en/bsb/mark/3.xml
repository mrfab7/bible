  <verse number="1">Once again Jesus entered the synagogue, and a man with a withered hand was there.</verse>
  <verse number="2">In order to accuse Jesus, they were watching to see if He would heal on the Sabbath.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then Jesus said to the man with the withered hand, “Stand up among us.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">And He asked them, “Which is lawful on the Sabbath: to do good or to do evil, to save life or to destroy it?” But they were silent.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Jesus looked around at them with anger and sorrow at their hardness of heart. Then He said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” So he stretched it out, and it was restored.</verse>
  <verse number="6">At this, the Pharisees went out and began plotting with the Herodians how they might kill Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="7">So Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea, accompanied by a large crowd from Galilee, Judea,</verse>
  <verse number="8">Jerusalem, Idumea, the region beyond the Jordan, and the vicinity of Tyre and Sidon. The large crowd came to Him when they heard what great things He was doing.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Jesus asked His disciples to have a boat ready for Him so that the crowd would not crush Him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For He had healed so many that all who had diseases were pressing forward to touch Him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And when the unclean spirits saw Him, they fell down before Him and cried out, “You are the Son of God!”</verse>
  <verse number="12">But He warned them sternly not to make Him known.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then Jesus went up on the mountain and called for those He wanted, and they came to Him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He appointed twelve of them, whom He designated as apostles, to accompany Him, to be sent out to preach,</verse>
  <verse number="15">and to have authority to drive out demons.</verse>
  <verse number="16">These are the twelve He appointed: Simon (whom He named Peter),</verse>
  <verse number="17">James son of Zebedee and his brother John (whom He named Boanerges, meaning “Sons of Thunder”),</verse>
  <verse number="18">Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot,</verse>
  <verse number="19">and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Then Jesus went home, and once again a crowd gathered, so that He and His disciples could not even eat.</verse>
  <verse number="21">When His family heard about this, they went out to take custody of Him, saying, “He is out of His mind.”</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and, “By the prince of the demons He drives out demons.”</verse>
  <verse number="23">So Jesus called them together and began to speak to them in parables: “How can Satan drive out Satan?</verse>
  <verse number="24">If a kingdom is divided against itself, it cannot stand.</verse>
  <verse number="25">If a house is divided against itself, it cannot stand.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And if Satan is divided and rises against himself, he cannot stand; his end has come.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Indeed, no one can enter a strong man’s house to steal his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can plunder his house.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Truly I tell you, the sons of men will be forgiven all sins and blasphemies, as many as they utter.</verse>
  <verse number="29">But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of eternal sin.”</verse>
  <verse number="30">Jesus made this statement because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”</verse>
  <verse number="31">Then Jesus’ mother and brothers came and stood outside. They sent someone in to summon Him,</verse>
  <verse number="32">and a crowd was sitting around Him. “Look,” He was told, “Your mother and brothers are outside, asking for You.”</verse>
  <verse number="33">But Jesus replied, “Who are My mother and My brothers?”</verse>
  <verse number="34">Looking at those seated in a circle around Him, He said, “Here are My mother and My brothers!</verse>
  <verse number="35">For whoever does the will of God is My brother and sister and mother.”</verse>
