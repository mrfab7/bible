<div class="chapter" data-book="Philemon" data-chapter="1" data-translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" data-translation-id="jps" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother: To Philemon our dearly-loved fellow labourer—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and to our sister Apphia and our comrade Archippus—as well as to the Church in your house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">May grace be granted to you all, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I give continual thanks to my God while making mention of you, my brother, in my prayers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have towards the Lord Jesus and which you manifest towards all God’s people;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">praying as I do, that their participation in your faith may result in others fully recognizing all the right affection that is in us toward Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For I have found great joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of God’s people have been, and are, refreshed through you, my brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Therefore, though I might with Christ’s authority speak very freely and order you to do what is fitting,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">it is for love’s sake that—instead of that—although I am none other than Paul the aged, and am now also a prisoner for Christ Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I entreat you on behalf of my own child whose father I have become while in my chains—I mean Onesimus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Formerly he was useless to you, but now—true to his name—he is of great use to you and to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I am sending him back to you, though in so doing I send part of myself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">It was my wish to keep him at my side for him to attend to my wants, as your representative, during my imprisonment for the Good News.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Only I wished to do nothing without your consent, so that his kind action of yours might not be done under pressure, but might be a voluntary one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For perhaps it was for this reason he was parted from you for a time, that you might receive him back wholly and for ever yours;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">no longer as a slave, but as something better than a slave—a brother peculiarly dear to me, and even dearer to you, both as a servant and as a fellow Christian.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If therefore you regard me as a comrade, receive him as if he were I myself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And if he was ever dishonest or is in your debt, debit me with the amount.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I Paul write this with my own hand—I will pay you in full. (I say nothing of the fact that you owe me even your own self.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Yes, brother, do me this favour for the Lord’s sake. Refresh my heart in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">I write to you in the full confidence that you will meet my wishes, for I know you will do even more than I say.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And at the same time provide accommodation for me; for I hope that through your prayers I shall be permitted to come to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Greetings to you, my brother, from Epaphras my fellow prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">and from Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with the spirit of every one of you.</p>
