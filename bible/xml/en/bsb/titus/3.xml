<chapter book="Titus" number="3" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Remind the believers to submit to rulers and authorities, to be obedient and ready for every good work,</verse>
  <verse number="2">to malign no one, and to be peaceable and gentle, showing full consideration to everyone.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For at one time we too were foolish, disobedient, misled, and enslaved to all sorts of desires and pleasures—living in malice and envy, being hated and hating one another.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But when the kindness of God our Savior and His love for mankind appeared,</verse>
  <verse number="5">He saved us, not by the righteous deeds we had done, but according to His mercy, through the washing of new birth and renewal by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="6">This is the Spirit He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior,</verse>
  <verse number="7">so that, having been justified by His grace, we would become heirs with the hope of eternal life.</verse>
  <verse number="8">This saying is trustworthy. And I want you to emphasize these things, so that those who have believed God will take care to devote themselves to good deeds. These things are excellent and profitable for the people.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But avoid foolish controversies, genealogies, arguments, and quarrels about the law, because these things are pointless and worthless.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Reject a divisive man after a first and second admonition,</verse>
  <verse number="11">knowing that such a man is corrupt and sinful; he is self-condemned.</verse>
  <verse number="12">As soon as I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis, because I have decided to winter there.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Do your best to equip Zenas the lawyer and Apollos, so that they will have everything they need.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And our people must also learn to devote themselves to good works in order to meet the pressing needs of others, so that they will not be unfruitful.</verse>
  <verse number="15">All who are with me send you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with all of you.</verse>
