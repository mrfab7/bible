  <verse number="2">And it goes out from Bethel to Luz. And it crosses the border of Archi to Ataroth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And it descends to the west, beside the border of Japhleti, as far as the borders of lower Beth-horon, and to Gezer. And the last parts of its regions are by the great sea.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Manasseh and Ephraim, the sons of Joseph, possessed it.</verse>

  <verse number="10">And the sons of Ephraim did not put to death the Canaanite that was living at Gezer. And the Canaanite lived in the midst of Ephraim, even to this day, paying tribute.</verse>
