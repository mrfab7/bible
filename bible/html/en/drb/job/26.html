<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Whose helper art thou? is it of him that is weak? and dost thou hold up the arm of him that has no strength?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">To whom hast thou given counsel? perhaps to him that hath no wisdom, and thou hast shewn thy very great prudence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Whom hast thou desired to teach? was it not him that made life?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Behold the giants groan under the waters, and they that dwell with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Hell is naked before him, and there is no covering for destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He stretched out the north over the empty space, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He bindeth up the waters in his clouds, so that they break not out and fall down together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He withholdeth the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud over it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He hath set bounds about the waters, till light and darkness come to an end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The pillars of heaven tremble, and dread at his beck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">By his power the seas are suddenly gathered together, and his wisdom has struck the proud one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">His spirit hath adorned the heavens, and his obstetric hand brought forth the winding serpent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Lo, these things are said in part of his ways: and seeing we have heard scarce a little drop of his word, who shall be able to behold the thunder of his greatness?</p>
