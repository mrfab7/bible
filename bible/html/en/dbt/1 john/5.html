<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Every one that believes that Jesus is the Christ is begotten of God; and every one that loves him that has begotten loves also him that is begotten of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hereby know we that we love the children of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments; and his commandments are not grievous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For all that has been begotten of God gets the victory over the world; and this is the victory which has gotten the victory over the world, our faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who is he that gets the victory over the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">This is he that came by water and blood, Jesus [the] Christ; not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit that bears witness, for the Spirit is the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For they that bear witness are three:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">the Spirit, and the water, and the blood; and the three agree in one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater. For this is the witness of God [which] he has witnessed concerning his Son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He that believes on the Son of God has the witness in himself; he that does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the witness which God has witnessed concerning his Son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And this is the witness, that God has given to us eternal life; and this life is in his Son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He that has the Son has life: he that has not the Son of God has not life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">These things have I written to you that ye may know that ye have eternal life who believe on the name of the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And this is the boldness which we have towards him, that if we ask him anything according to his will he hears us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And if we know that he hears us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If any one see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life, for those that do not sin unto death. There is a sin to death: I do not say of that that he should make a request.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Every unrighteousness is sin; and there is a sin not to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">We know that every one begotten of God does not sin, but he that has been begotten of God keeps himself, and the wicked [one] does not touch him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the wicked [one].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us an understanding that we should know him that [is] true; and we are in him that [is] true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Children, keep yourselves from idols.</p>
