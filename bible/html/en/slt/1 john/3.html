<div class="chapter" data-book="1 John" data-chapter="3" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">See ye, what kind of love the Father has given us, that we should be called the children of God: for this the world knows us not, for it knew him not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Dearly beloved, now are we the children of God, and it has not yet been manifested what we shall be: and we know that, if he be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And every one having this hope in him purifies himself, as he himself is pure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Every one doing sin also does lawlessness; for sin is lawlessness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And ye know that he was manifested that he might let go our sins; and in him is no sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Every one remaining in him sins not: every one sinning has not seen him, nor known him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Little children, let none deceive you: he doing justice is just, as he is just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He doing sin is of the accuser; for the accuser sins from the beginning. For this was the Son of God manifested, that he might loose the works of the accuser.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Every one born of God does not sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, for he has been born of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the accuser: every one not doing justice is not of God, and he not loving his brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And for what slew he him? Because his works were evil, and those of his brother just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Be not amazed, my brethren, if the world hate you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">We know that we have passed from death to life, for we love the brethren. He not loving the brother remains in death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Every one hating his brother is a manslayer: and ye know that no manslayer has eternal life remaining in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">In this have we known love, for he set his soul for us: and we ought to set the souls for the brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And whoever has the life of the world, and sees his brother having need, and should shut up his bowels from him, how remains the love of God in him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">My little children, we should not love in word, neither in tongue; but in work and truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And in this we know that we are of the truth, and we will yield our hearts before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For if our heart condemn us, for God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Dearly beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have freedom of speech towards God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And whatever we ask, we receive of him, for we keep his commands, and do things pleasing before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And this is his command, That we believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us command.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And he keeping his commands remains in him, and he in him. And in this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit he gave us.</p>
