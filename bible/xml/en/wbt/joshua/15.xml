  <verse number="1">This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; even to the border of Edom, the wilderness of Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south border.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And their south border was from the shore of the salt-sea, from the bay that looketh southward:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And it went out to the south side to Maaleh-acrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended on the south side to Kadesh-barnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:</verse>
  <verse number="4">From thence it passed towards Azmon, and went out to the river of Egypt; and the limits of that border were at the sea: this shall be your south limit.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the east border was the salt-sea, even to the end of Jordan: and their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea, at the uttermost part of Jordan:</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the border went up to Beth-hogla, and passed along by the north of Beth-arabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the border went up towards Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward looking towards Gilgal, that is before the going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed towards the waters of En-shemesh, and the borders of it were at En-rogel:</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom, to the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward:</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the border was drawn from the top of the hill to the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjath-jearim:</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the border compassed from Baalah westward to mount Seir, and passed along to the side of mount Jearim (which is Chesalon) on the north side, and went down to Beth-shemesh, and passed on to Timnah:</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the border went out to the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out to Jabneel; and the terminations of the border were at the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the west border was to the great sea, and its coast: this is the border of the children of Judah round about, according to their families.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And to Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before was Kirjath-sepher.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath-sepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter for a wife.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And it came to pass, as she came to him, that she moved him to ask of her father a field. And she lighted off her ass; and Caleb said to her, What wouldst thou?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land, give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.</verse>
  <verse number="20">This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.</verse>
