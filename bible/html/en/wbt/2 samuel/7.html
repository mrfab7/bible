<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest around from all his enemies;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">That the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thy heart: for the LORD is with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Wilt thou build me a house for me to dwell in?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent, and in a tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In all the places in which I have walked with all the children of Israel have I spoken a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why do ye not build me a house of cedar?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Now therefore so shalt thou say to my servant David, thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheep-cote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thy enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like to the name of the great men that are in the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Moreover, I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as formerly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thy enemies. Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee a house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And when thy days shall be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he shall commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But my mercy shall not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And thy house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then king David went in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And what can David say more to thee? for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For thy word’s sake, and according to thy own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people to thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words are true, and thou hast promised this goodness to thy servant:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.</p>
