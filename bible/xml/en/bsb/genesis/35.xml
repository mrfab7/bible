  <verse number="1">Then God said to Jacob, “Arise, go up to Bethel, and settle there. Build an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau.”</verse>
  <verse number="2">So Jacob told his household and all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods that are among you. Purify yourselves and change your garments.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then let us arise and go to Bethel. I will build an altar there to God, who answered me in my day of distress. He has been with me wherever I have gone.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">So they gave Jacob all their foreign gods and all their earrings, and Jacob buried them under the oak near Shechem.</verse>
  <verse number="5">As they set out, a terror from God fell over the surrounding cities, so that they did not pursue Jacob’s sons.</verse>
  <verse number="6">So Jacob and everyone with him arrived in Luz (that is, Bethel) in the land of Canaan.</verse>
  <verse number="7">There Jacob built an altar, and he called that place El-bethel, because it was there that God had revealed Himself to Jacob as he fled from his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried under the oak below Bethel. So Jacob named it Allon-bacuth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">After Jacob had returned from Paddan-aram, God appeared to him again and blessed him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And God said to him, “Though your name is Jacob, you will no longer be called Jacob. Instead, your name will be Israel.” So God named him Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And God told him, “I am God Almighty. Be fruitful and multiply. A nation—even a company of nations—shall come from you, and kings shall descend from you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give this land to your descendants after you.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then God went up from the place where He had spoken with him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">So Jacob set up a pillar in the place where God had spoken with him—a stone marker—and he poured out a drink offering on it and anointed it with oil.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Jacob called the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Later, they set out from Bethel, and while they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth, and her labor was difficult.</verse>
  <verse number="17">During her severe labor, the midwife said to her, “Do not be afraid, for you are having another son.”</verse>
  <verse number="18">And with her last breath—for she was dying—she named him Ben-oni. But his father called him Benjamin.</verse>
  <verse number="19">So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).</verse>
  <verse number="20">Jacob set up a pillar on her grave; it marks Rachel’s tomb to this day.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Israel again set out and pitched his tent beyond the Tower of Eder.</verse>
  <verse number="22">While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard about it. Jacob had twelve sons:</verse>
  <verse number="23">The sons of Leah were Reuben the firstborn of Jacob, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The sons of Rachel’s maidservant Bilhah were Dan and Naphtali.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the sons of Leah’s maidservant Zilpah were Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan-aram.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Jacob returned to his father Isaac at Mamre, near Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had stayed.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Isaac lived 180 years.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people, old and full of years. And his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.</verse>
