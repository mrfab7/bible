<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="13" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">IF I speak with the tongues of men, and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And if I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries, and all knowledge, and if I should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Charity is patient, is kind: charity envieth not, dealeth not perversely; is not puffed up;</verse>
  <verse number="5">Is not ambitious, seeketh not her own, is not provoked to anger, thinketh no evil;</verse>
  <verse number="6">Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth with the truth;</verse>
  <verse number="7">Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Charity never falleth away: whether prophecies shall be made void, or tongues shall cease, or knowledge shall be destroyed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.</verse>
  <verse number="11">When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But, when I became a man, I put away the things of a child.</verse>
  <verse number="12">We see now through a glass in a dark manner; but then face to face. Now I know I part; but then I shall know even as I am known.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And now there remain faith, hope, and charity, these three: but the greatest of these is charity.</verse>
