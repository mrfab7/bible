<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="33" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And yet, I pray thee, O Job, Hear my speech and to all my words give ear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Lo, I pray thee, I have opened my mouth, My tongue hath spoken in the palate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Of the uprightness of my heart are my sayings, And knowledge have my lips clearly spoken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The Spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the Mighty doth quicken me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If thou art able—answer me, Set in array before me—station thyself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Lo, I am, according to thy word, for God, From the clay I—I also, have been formed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Lo, my terror doth not frighten thee, And my burden on thee is not heavy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Surely—thou hast said in mine ears, And the sounds of words I hear:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Pure am I, without transgression, Innocent am I, and I have no iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Lo, occasions against me He doth find, He doth reckon me for an enemy to Him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He doth put in the stocks my feet, He doth watch all my paths.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Lo, in this thou hast not been righteous, I answer thee, that greater is God than man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Wherefore against Him hast thou striven, When for all His matters He answereth not?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For once doth God speak, and twice, (He doth not behold it.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">In a dream—a vision of night, In the falling of deep sleep on men, In slumberings on a bed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Then He uncovereth the ear of men, And for their instruction sealeth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">To turn aside man from doing, And pride from man He concealeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He keepeth back his soul from corruption, And his life from passing away by a dart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And he hath been reproved With pain on his bed, And the strife of his bones is enduring.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And his life hath nauseated bread, And his soul desirable food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His flesh is consumed from being seen, And high are his bones, they were not seen!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And draw near to the pit doth his soul, And his life to those causing death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If there is by him a messenger, An interpreter—one of a thousand, To declare for man his uprightness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Then He doth favour him and saith, ‘Ransom him from going down to the pit, I have found an atonement.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Fresher is his flesh than a child’s, He returneth to the days of his youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He maketh supplication unto God, And He accepteth him. And he seeth His face with shouting, And He returneth to man His righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He looketh on men, and saith, ‘I sinned, And uprightness I have perverted, And it hath not been profitable to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He hath ransomed my soul From going over into the pit, And my life on the light looketh.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Lo, all these doth God work, Twice—thrice with man,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">To bring back his soul from the pit, To be enlightened with the light of the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Attend, O Job, hearken to me, Keep silent, and I—I do speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">If there are words—answer me, Speak, for I have a desire to justify thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If there are not—hearken thou to me, Keep silent, and I teach thee wisdom.</p>
