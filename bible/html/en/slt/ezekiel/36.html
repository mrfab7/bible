<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And thou son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of Jehovah:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because the enemy said against you, Aha! and the heights of old were for a possession to us:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For this, prophesy and say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because for, because of making desolate, and panting after you from round about, for you to be a possession for the remainder of the nations, and ye will come up upon the lips of the tongue and a slander of the people:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For this ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus said the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and to the hills, to the torrents and to the valleys, and to the desolate wastes, and to cities being forsaken which were for plunder and for derision to the rest of the nations that are from round about;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: If not in the fire of my jealousy I spake against the rest of the nations and against all Edom who gave my land to them for a possession with joy of all the heart, with contempt of soul for casting it out for plunder.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For this, prophesy against the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and to the hills, and to the torrents and to the valleys, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me, in my jealousy and in my wrath did I speak because ye bore the shame of the nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: I lifted up my hand; if not the nations who are from round about to you, they shall bear their shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And ye mountains of Israel, ye shall give your branch, and ye shall bear your fruit to my people Israel; for they drew near to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For behold me for you, and I turned to you and ye were tilled and sown.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I multiplied man upon you, all the house of Israel, all of it: and the cities were inhabited and the wastes shall be built.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And I multiplied upon you man and cattle; and they multiplied and were fruitful: and I caused you to dwell according to your former times, and I did good above your beginnings: and ye knew that I am Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And I caused man to go upon you, my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou wert to them for an inheritance, and thou shalt no more add to bereave them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of their saying to you, Thou didst consume man, and thou wert bereaving thy nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For this, thou shalt no more consume man, and thou shalt no more bereave thy nation; says the Lord Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And I will no more cause to be heard in thee the shame of the nations, and thou shalt bear no more the reproach of the peoples, and thou shalt no more bereave thy nations, says the Lord Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Son of man, the house of Israel dwelling upon their land, and they will defile it with their way and with their doings: their way was before me as the uncleanness of her set apart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And I will pour out my wrath upon them upon the blood which they poured out upon the land, and they defiled it by their blocks:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And I will scatter them among the nations, and they shall be dispersed in the lands: according to their ways and according to their doings, I judged them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And he will come to the nations where they came in there, and they will profane my holy name in saying to them, These the people of Jehovah, and they went forth from their land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And I will spare for my holy name that the house of Israel profaned among the nations where they went there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For this, say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: I do not for your sake, O house of Israel, but for my holy name which ye profaned among the nations where ye went there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And I consecrated my great name, being profaned among the nations which ye profaned, in the midst of them; and the nations shall know that I am Jehovah, says the Lord Jehovah, in my being consecrated among you before your eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And I took you from the nations and I gathered you from all the lands, and I brought you into your land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And I sprinkled clean waters upon you, and ye were cleansed: from all your uncleannesses and from all your blocks will I cleanse you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And I gave to you a new heart, and a new spirit will I give in the midst of you: and I turned away your heart of stone from your flesh, and I gave to you an heart of flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And my spirit I will, give in the midst of you, and I made that ye shall go in my laws, and my judgments shall ye watch and do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And ye dwelt in the land which I gave to your fathers, and ye were to me for a people, and I shall be to you for God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And I saved you from all your uncleannesses: and I called for the grain and I multiplied it, and I will not give famine upon you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And I multiplied the fruit of the tree and the produce of the field, so that ye shall no more take the reproach of famine among the nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And ye remembered your evil ways and your doings which not being good, and ye loathed with your faces for your iniquities and for your abominations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">I did not for your sakes, says the Lord Jehovah, it shall be known to you: be ashamed and be disgraced for your ways, O house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Thus said the Lord Jehovah; In the day of my cleansing you from all your iniquities, and I caused the cities to be inhabited, and the walls were built.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And the desolate land shall be worked instead of its being a desolation before the eyes of all passing by.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And they said: This land being desolate was as the garden of Eden: and the cities laid waste and desolated and destroyed, being fortified, were inhabited.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And the nations which shall be left round about you shall know that I Jehovah built the destroyed, I planted the desolated: I Jehovah spake, and I did.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Yet this will I be sought out to the house of Israel, to do to them; I will multiply them with men as sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">As holy sheep, as the sheep of Jerusalem in her appointments; thus shall the cities laid waste be filled with flocks of men: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.</p>
