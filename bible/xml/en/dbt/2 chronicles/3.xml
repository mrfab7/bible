  <verse number="4">And the porch which was in front was twenty cubits in length, in front of the house broadways, and the height was a hundred and twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the greater house he boarded with cypress-wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set on it palm-trees and chains.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he overlaid the house with precious stones for beauty; and the gold was gold of Parvaim.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he covered the house, the beams, the threshold, and its walls, and its doors with gold, and engraved cherubim on the walls.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he made the house of the most holy place, the length of which was according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits; and he covered it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.</verse>

  <verse number="10">And in the house of the most holy place he made two cherubim of image work, and they overlaid them with gold.</verse>

  <verse number="14">And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and byssus, and made cherubim upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And before the house he made two pillars thirty-five cubits long; and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he made chains [as] in the oracle, and he put them on the top of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the right hand and the other on the left; and he called the name of that on the right Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.</verse>
