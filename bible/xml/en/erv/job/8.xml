  <verse number="1">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a mighty wind?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?</verse>
  <verse number="4">If thy children have sinned against him, and he have delivered them into the hand of their transgression:</verse>
  <verse number="5">If thou wouldest seek diligently unto God, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;</verse>
  <verse number="6">If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out:</verse>
  <verse number="9">(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)</verse>
  <verse number="10">Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Whilst it is yet in its greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.</verse>
  <verse number="13">So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hope of the godless man shall perish:</verse>
  <verse number="14">Whose confidence shall break in sunder, and whose trust is a spider’s web.</verse>
  <verse number="15">He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure.</verse>
  <verse number="16">He is green before the sun, and his shoots go forth over his garden.</verse>
  <verse number="17">His roots are wrapped about the heap, he beholdeth the place of stones.</verse>
  <verse number="18">If he be destroyed from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others spring.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he uphold the evil-doers.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He will yet fill thy mouth with laughter, and thy lips with shouting.</verse>
  <verse number="22">They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the tent of the wicked shall be no more.</verse>
