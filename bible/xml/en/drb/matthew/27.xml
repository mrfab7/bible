  <verse number="1">AND when morning was come, all the chief priests and ancients of the people took counsel against Jesus, that they might put him to death.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And they brought him bound, and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then Judas, who betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repenting himself, brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and ancients,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Saying: I have sinned in betraying innocent blood. But they said: What is that to us? look thou to it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed: and went and hanged himself with an halter.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But the chief priests having taken the pieces of silver, said: It is not lawful to put them into the corbona, because it is the price of blood.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the potter’s field, to be a burying place for strangers.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For this cause the field was called Haceldama, that is, The field of blood, even to this day.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the prophet, saying: And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was prized, whom they prized of the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they gave them unto the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed to me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying: Art thou the king of the Jews? Jesus saith to him: Thou sayest it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And when he was accused by the chief priests and ancients, he answered nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then Pilate saith to him: Dost not thou hear how great testimonies they allege against thee?</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he answered him to never a word; so that the governor wondered exceedingly.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Now upon the solemn day the governor was accustomed to release to the people one prisoner, whom they would.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he had then a notorious prisoner, that was called Barabbas.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They therefore being gathered together, Pilate said: Whom will you that I release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus that is called Christ?</verse>
  <verse number="18">For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And as he was sitting in the place of judgment, his wife sent to him, saying: Have thou nothing to do with that just man; for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But the chief priests and ancients persuaded the people, that they should ask Barabbas, and make Jesus away.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the governor answering, said to them: Whether will you of the two to be released unto you? But they said, Barabbas.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Pilate saith to them: What shall I do then with Jesus that is called Christ? They say all: Let him be crucified.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The governor said to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more, saying: Let him be crucified.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Pilate seeing that he prevailed nothing, but that rather a tumult was made; taking water washed his hands before the people, saying: I am innocent of the blood of this just man; look you to it.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the whole people answering, said: His blood be upon us and our children.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Then he released to them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him unto them to be crucified.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Then the soldiers of the governor taking Jesus into the hall, gathered together unto him the whole band;</verse>
  <verse number="28">And stripping him, they put a scarlet cloak about him.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand. And bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, saying: Hail, king of the Jews.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And spitting upon him, they took the reed, and struck his head.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And after they had mocked him, they took off the cloak from him, and put on him his own garments, and led him away to crucify him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon: him they forced to take up his cross.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And they came to the place that is called Golgotha, which is the place of Calvary.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall. And when he had tasted, he would not drink.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And after they had crucified him, they divided his garments, casting lots; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying: They divided my garments among them; and upon my vesture they cast lots.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And they sat and watched him.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And they put over his head his cause written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
  <verse number="38">Then were crucified with him two thieves: one on the right hand, and one on the left.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And they that passed by, blasphemed him, wagging their heads,</verse>
  <verse number="40">And saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God, and in three days dost rebuild it: save thy own self: if thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross.</verse>
  <verse number="41">In like manner also the chief priests, with the scribes and ancients, mocking, said:</verse>
  <verse number="42">He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the king of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him.</verse>
  <verse number="43">He trusted in God; let him now deliver him if he will have him; for he said: I am the Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And the selfsame thing the thieves also, that were crucified with him, reproached him with.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over the whole earth, until the ninth hour.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying: Eli, Eli, lamma sabacthani? that is, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</verse>
  <verse number="47">And some that stood there and heard, said: This man calleth Elias.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And immediately one of them running took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar; and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</verse>
  <verse number="49">And the others said: Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to deliver him.</verse>
  <verse number="50">And Jesus again crying with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</verse>
  <verse number="51">And behold the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top even to the bottom, and the earth quaked, and the rocks were rent.</verse>
  <verse number="52">And the graves were opened: and many bodies of the saints that had slept arose,</verse>
  <verse number="53">And coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, came into the holy city, and appeared to many.</verse>
  <verse number="54">Now the centurion and they that were with him watching Jesus, having seen the earthquake, and the things that were done, were sore afraid, saying: Indeed this was the Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="55">And there were there many women afar off, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him:</verse>
  <verse number="56">Among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</verse>
  <verse number="57">And when it was evening, there came a certain rich man of Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="58">He went to Pilate, and asked the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded that the body should be delivered.</verse>
  <verse number="59">And Joseph taking the body, wrapped it up in a clean linen cloth.</verse>
  <verse number="60">And laid it in his own new monument, which he had hewed out in a rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the monument, and went his way.</verse>
  <verse number="61">And there was there Mary Magdalen, and the other Mary sitting over against the sepulchre.</verse>
  <verse number="62">And the next day, which followed the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate,</verse>
  <verse number="63">Saying: Sir, we have remembered, that that seducer said, while he was yet alive: After three days I will rise again.</verse>
  <verse number="64">Command therefore the sepulchre to be guarded until the third day: lest perhaps his disciples come and steal him away, and say to the people: He is risen from the dead; and the last error shall be worse than the first.</verse>
  <verse number="65">Pilate saith to them: You have a guard; go, guard it as you know.</verse>
  <verse number="66">And they departing, made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone, and setting guards.</verse>
