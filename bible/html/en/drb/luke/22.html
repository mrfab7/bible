<p class="verse" data-verse="1">NOW the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the pasch, was at hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put Jesus to death: but they feared the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Satan entered into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariot, one of the twelve.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he went, and discoursed with the chief priests and the magistrates, how he might betray him to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he promised. And he sought opportunity to betray him in the absence of the multitude.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the day of the unleavened bread came, on which it was necessary that the pasch should be killed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he sent Peter and John, saying: Go, and prepare for us the pasch, that we may eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But they said: Where wilt thou that we prepare?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he said to them: Behold, as you go into the city, there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water: follow him into the house where he entereth in.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And you shall say to the goodman of the house: The master saith to thee, Where is the guest chamber, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And he will shew you a large dining room, furnished; and there prepare.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And they going, found as he had said to them, and made ready the pasch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he said to them: With desire I have desired to eat this pasch with you, before I suffer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For I say to you, that from this time I will not eat it, till it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And having taken the chalice, he gave thanks, and said: Take, and divide it among you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For I say to you, that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And taking bread, he gave thanks, and brake; and gave to them, saying: This is my body, which is given for you. Do this for a commemoration of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In like manner the chalice also, after he had supped, saying: This is the chalice, the new testament in my blood, which shall be shed for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But yet behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the Son of man indeed goeth, according to that which is determined: but yet, woe to that man by whom he shall be betrayed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And there was also a strife amongst them, which of them should seem to be the greater.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And he said to them: The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they that have power over them, are called beneficent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But you not so: but he that is the greater among you, let him become as the younger; and he that is the leader, as he that serveth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For which is greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that serveth? Is it not he that sitteth at table? But I am in the midst of you, as he that serveth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And you are they who have continued with me in my temptations:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And I dispose to you, as my Father hath disposed to me, a kingdom;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">That you may eat and drink at my table, in my kingdom: and may sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And the Lord said: Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and thou, being once converted, confirm thy brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Who said to him: Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And he said: I say to thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, till thou thrice deniest that thou knowest me. And he said to them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, did you want anything?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">But they said: Nothing. Then said he unto them: But now he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a scrip; and he that hath not, let him sell his coat, and buy a sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">For I say to you, that this that is written must yet be fulfilled in me: And with the wicked was he reckoned. For the things concerning me have an end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">But they said: Lord, behold here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And going out, he went, according to his custom, to the mount of Olives. And his disciples also followed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And when he was come to the place, he said to them: Pray, lest ye enter into temptation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And he was withdrawn away from them a stone’s cast; and kneeling down, he prayed,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">Saying: Father, if thou wilt, remove this chalice from me: but yet not my will, but thine be done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. And being in an agony, he prayed the longer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And his sweat became as drops of blood, trickling down upon the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">And he said to them: Why sleep you? arise, pray, lest you enter into temptation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">As he was yet speaking, behold a multitude; and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus, for to kiss him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">And Jesus said to him: Judas, dost thou betray the Son of man with a kiss?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">And they that were about him, seeing what would follow, said to him: Lord, shall we strike with the sword?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">But Jesus answering, said: Suffer ye thus far. And when he had touched his ear, he healed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">And Jesus said to the chief priests, and magistrates of the temple, and the ancients, that were come unto him: Are ye come out, as it were against a thief, with swords and clubs?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not stretch forth your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">And apprehending him, they led him to the high priest’s house. But Peter followed afar off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were sitting about it, Peter was in the midst of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">Whom when a certain servant maid had seen sitting at the light, and had earnestly beheld him, she said: This man also was with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="57">But he denied him, saying: Woman, I know him not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="58">And after a little while, another seeing him, said: Thou also art one of them. But Peter said: O man, I am not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="59">And after the space, as it were of one hour, another certain man affirmed, saying: Of a truth, this man was also with him; for he is also a Galilean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="60">And Peter said: Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, as he was yet speaking, the cock crew.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="61">And the Lord turning looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, as he had said: Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="62">And Peter going out, wept bitterly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="63">And the men that held him, mocked him, and struck him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="64">And they blindfolded him, and smote his face. And they asked him, saying: Prophesy, who is it that struck thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="65">And blaspheming, many other things they said against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="66">And as soon as it was day, the ancients of the people, and the chief priests and scribes, cane together; and they brought him into their council, saying: If thou be the Christ, tell us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="67">And he saith to them: If I shall tell you, you will not believe me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="68">And if I shall also ask you, you will not answer me, nor let me go.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="69">But hereafter the Son of man shall be sitting on the right hand of the power of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="70">Then said they all: Art thou then the Son of God? Who said: You say that I am.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="71">And they said: What need we any further testimony? for we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth.</p>
