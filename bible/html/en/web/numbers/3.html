<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now this is the history of the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that Yahweh spoke with Moses in Mount Sinai.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">These are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests who were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest’s office.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Nadab and Abihu died before Yahweh, when they offered strange fire before Yahweh, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children. Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest’s office in the presence of Aaron their father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">“Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They shall keep his requirements, and the requirements of the whole congregation before the Tent of Meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They shall keep all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting, and the obligations of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">You shall give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons. They are wholly given to him on the behalf of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">You shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall keep their priesthood. The stranger who comes near shall be put to death.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">“Behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn who open the womb among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">for all the firstborn are mine. On the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I made holy to me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and animal. They shall be mine. I am Yahweh.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">“Count the children of Levi by their fathers’ houses, by their families. You shall count every male from a month old and upward.”</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Those who were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, even those who were numbered of them were seven thousand five hundred.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The families of the Gershonites shall encamp behind the tabernacle westward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The prince of the fathers’ house of the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The duty of the sons of Gershon in the Tent of Meeting shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, its covering, and the screen for the door of the Tent of Meeting,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the door of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and around the altar, and its cords for all of its service.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Yahweh said to Moses, “Number all the firstborn males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">You shall take the Levites for me (I am Yahweh) instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the livestock of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the livestock of the children of Israel.”</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="43">All the firstborn males according to the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those who were numbered of them, were twenty-two thousand two hundred seventy-three.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">“Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites instead of their livestock; and the Levites shall be mine. I am Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">For the redemption of the two hundred seventy-three of the firstborn of the children of Israel, who exceed the number of the Levites,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">you shall take five shekels apiece for each one; after the shekel of the sanctuary you shall take them (the shekel is twenty gerahs):</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">and you shall give the money, with which their remainder is redeemed, to Aaron and to his sons.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">Moses took the redemption money from those who exceeded the number of those who were redeemed by the Levites;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">from the firstborn of the children of Israel he took the money, one thousand three hundred sixty-five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">and Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses.</p>
