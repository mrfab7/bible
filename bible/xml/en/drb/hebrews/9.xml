<chapter book="Hebrews" number="9" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The former indeed had also justifications of divine service, and a worldly sanctuary.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For there was a tabernacle made the first, wherein were the candlesticks, and the table, and the setting forth of loaves, which is called the holy.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And after the second veil, the tabernacle, which is called the holy of holies:</verse>
  <verse number="4">Having a golden censer, and the ark of the testament covered about on every part with gold, in which was a golden pot that had manna, and the rod of Aaron, that had blossomed, and the tables of the testament.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And over it were the cherubims of glory overshadowing the propitiatory: of which it is not needful to speak now particularly.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now these things being thus ordered, into the first tabernacle the priests indeed always entered, accomplishing the offices of sacrifices.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But into the second, the high priest alone, once a year: not without blood, which he offereth for his own, and the people’s ignorance:</verse>
  <verse number="8">The Holy Ghost signifying this, that the way into the holies was not yet made manifest, whilst the former tabernacle was yet standing.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Which is a parable of the time present: according to which gifts and sacrifices are offered, which can not, as to the conscience, make him perfect that serveth, only in meats and in drinks,</verse>
  <verse number="10">And divers washings, and justices of the flesh laid on them until the time of correction.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But Christ, being come an high priest of the good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hand, that is, not of this creation:</verse>
  <verse number="12">Neither by the blood of goats, or of calves, but by his own blood, entered once into the holies, having obtained eternal redemption.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For if the blood of goats and of oxen, and the ashes of an heifer being sprinkled, sanctify such as are defiled, to the cleansing of the flesh:</verse>
  <verse number="14">How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the Holy Ghost offered himself unspotted unto God, cleanse our conscience from dead works, to serve the living God?</verse>
  <verse number="15">And therefore he is the mediator of the new testament: that by means of his death, for the redemption of those trangressions, which were under the former testament, they that are called may receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For where there is a testament, the death of the testator must of necessity come in.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For a testament is of force, after men are dead: otherwise it is as yet of no strength, whilst the testator liveth.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Whereupon neither was the first indeed dedicated without blood.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For when every commandment of the law had been read by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</verse>
  <verse number="20">Saying: This is the blood of the testament, which God hath enjoined unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The tabernacle also and all the vessels of the ministry, in like manner, he sprinkled with blood.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And almost all things, according to the law, are cleansed with blood: and without shedding of blood there is no remission.</verse>
  <verse number="23">It is necessary therefore that the patterns of heavenly things should be cleansed with these: but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For Jesus is not entered into the holies made with hands, the patterns of the true: but into heaven itself, that he may appear now in the presence of God for us.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the holies, every year with the blood of others:</verse>
  <verse number="26">For then he ought to have suffered often from the beginning of the world: but now once at the end of ages, he hath appeared for the destruction of sin, by the sacrifice of himself.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And as it is appointed unto men once to die, and after this the judgment:</verse>
  <verse number="28">So also Christ was offered once to exhaust the sins of many; the second time he shall appear without sin to them that expect him unto salvation.</verse>
