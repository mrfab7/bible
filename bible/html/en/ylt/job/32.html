<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="32" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And these three men cease from answering Job, for he is righteous in his own eyes,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and burn doth the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram; against Job hath his anger burned, because of his justifying himself more than God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and against his three friends hath his anger burned, because that they have not found an answer, and condemn Job.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Elihu hath waited earnestly beside Job with words, for they are older than he in days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Elihu seeth that there is no answer in the mouth of the three men, and his anger burneth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite answereth and saith:—Young I am in days, and ye are age Therefore I have feared, And am afraid of shewing you my opinion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I said: Days do speak, And multitude of years teach wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Surely a spirit is in man, And the breath of the Mighty One Doth cause them to understand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The multitude are not wise, Nor do the aged understand judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore I have said: Hearken to me, I do shew my opinion—even I.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Lo, I have waited for your words, I give ear unto your reasons, Till ye search out sayings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And unto you I attend, And lo, there is no reasoner for Job, Or answerer of his sayings among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Lest ye say, We have found wisdom, God doth thrust him away, not man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he hath not set in array words for me, And with your sayings I do not answer him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">(They have broken down, They have not answered again, They removed from themselves words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And I have waited, but they do not speak, For they have stood still, They have not answered any more.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I answer, even I—my share, I shew my opinion—even I.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For I have been full of words, Distressed me hath the spirit of my breast,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Lo, my breast is as wine not opened, Like new bottles it is broken up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I speak, and there is refreshment to me, I open my lips and answer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Let me not, I pray you, accept the face of any, Nor unto man give flattering titles,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For I have not known to give flattering titles, In a little doth my Maker take me away.</p>
