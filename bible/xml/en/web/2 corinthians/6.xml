<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="6" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Working together, we entreat also that you not receive the grace of God in vain,</verse>
  <verse number="2">for he says, “At an acceptable time I listened to you, in a day of salvation I helped you.” Behold, now is the acceptable time. Behold, now is the day of salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="3">We give no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our service may not be blamed,</verse>
  <verse number="4">but in everything commending ourselves, as servants of God, in great endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,</verse>
  <verse number="5">in beatings, in imprisonments, in riots, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;</verse>
  <verse number="6">in pureness, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,</verse>
  <verse number="7">in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,</verse>
  <verse number="8">by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;</verse>
  <verse number="9">as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and not killed;</verse>
  <verse number="10">as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians. Our heart is enlarged.</verse>
  <verse number="12">You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Now in return, I speak as to my children, you also be open wide.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Don’t be unequally yoked with unbelievers, for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?</verse>
  <verse number="15">What agreement has Christ with Belial? Or what portion has a believer with an unbeliever?</verse>
  <verse number="16">What agreement has a temple of God with idols? For you are a temple of the living God. Even as God said, “I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they will be my people.”</verse>
  <verse number="17">Therefore, “‘Come out from among them, and be separate,’ says the Lord. ‘Touch no unclean thing. I will receive you.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I will be to you a Father. You will be to me sons and daughters,’ says the Lord Almighty.”</verse>
