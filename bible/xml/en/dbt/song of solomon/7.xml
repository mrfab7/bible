  <verse number="1">How beautiful are thy footsteps in sandals, O prince’s daughter! The roundings of thy thighs are like jewels, The work of the hands of an artist.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thy navel is a round goblet, [which] wanteth not mixed wine; Thy belly a heap of wheat, set about with lilies;</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thy two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle;</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; Thine eyes, [like] the pools in Heshbon, By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Thy nose like the tower of Lebanon, Which looketh toward Damascus;</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, And the locks of thy head like purple; The king is fettered by [thy] ringlets!</verse>
  <verse number="6">How fair and how pleasant art thou, [my] love, in delights!</verse>
  <verse number="7">This thy stature is like to a palm-tree, And thy breasts to grape clusters.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I said, I will go up to the palm-tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof; And thy breasts shall indeed be like clusters of the vine, And the fragrance of thy nose like apples,</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine,... That goeth down smoothly for my beloved, And stealeth over the lips of them that are asleep.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I am my beloved’s, And his desire is toward me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">—Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the fields; Let us lodge in the villages.</verse>
  <verse number="12">We will go up early to the vineyards, We will see if the vine hath budded, [If] the blossom is opening, And the pomegranates are in bloom: There will I give thee my loves.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The mandrakes yield fragrance; And at our gates are all choice fruits, new and old: I have laid them up for thee, my beloved.</verse>
