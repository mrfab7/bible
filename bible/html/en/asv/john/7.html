<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judæa, because the Jews sought to kill him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judæa, that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For no man doeth anything in secret, and himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For even his brethren did not believe on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Jesus therefore saith unto them, My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Go ye up unto the feast: I go not up unto this feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And having said these things unto them, he abode still in Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But when his brethren were gone up unto the feast, then went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but he leadeth the multitude astray.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The Jews therefore marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Jesus therefore answered them and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak from myself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you doeth the law? Why seek ye to kill me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The multitude answered, Thou hast a demon: who seeketh to kill thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Jesus answered and said unto them, I did one work, and ye all marvel because thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Moses hath given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing unto him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Jesus therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When the Christ shall come, will he do more signs than those which this man hath done?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? will he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">What is this word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet given; because Jesus was not yet glorified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Some of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">The officers answered, Never man so spake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also led astray?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">But this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came to him before, being one of them),</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">Doth our law judge a man, except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">[And they went every man unto his own house:</p>
