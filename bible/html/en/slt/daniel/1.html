<p class="verse" data-verse="1">In the third year to the kingdom of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel to Jerusalem, and he will press it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Jehovah will give Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, and from the number of vessels of the house of God: and he will bring them to the land of Shinar the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Children whom not any blemish in them, and good of aspect, and understanding in all wisdom, and knowing knowledge, and understanding intelligence, and to whom power in them to stand in the king’s temple, and to teach them the writing and tongue of the chaldees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the king will allot to them the word of a day in its day from the king’s dainties and from the wine of his drinking: and to nourish them three years, and from the end of three years they shall stand before the king.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the chief of the eunuchs will say to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who allotted your food and your drink: for wherefore shall he see your faces gloomy above the children as of your age? and make my head guilty to the King.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Daniel will say to Melzar, whom the chief of the eunuchs appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Prove now thy servants, ten days; and they shall give to us from seed herbs, and we will eat, and water, and we will drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And our aspects shall be seen before thee, and the aspect of the children eating the king’s dainties: and according to what thou shalt see, do with thy servants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he wilt hear to them for this word, and he will try them ten days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And from the end of ten days their aspect was seen good and fat of flesh above all the children eating of the king’s dainties.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Melzar will be taking away their dainties, and the wine of their drinking, and he gave to them seed herbs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And these four children, God gave to them knowledge and understanding in all writing and wisdom: and Daniel understood in every vision and dreams.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And from the end of the days when the king said to bring them in, and the chief of the eunuchs will bring them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the king will speak with them: and there was not found from all of them as Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: and they will stand before the king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And every word of the wisdom of understanding which the king sought from them, and he will find them ten hands over all the sacred scribes, the enchanters which were in all his kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Daniel will be even to one year to Cyrus the king.</p>
