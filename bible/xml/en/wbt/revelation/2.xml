  <verse number="1">To the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;</verse>
  <verse number="2">I know thy works, and thy labor, and thy patience, and that thou canst not bear them who are evil; and thou hast tried them who say they are apostles, and are not; and hast found them liars:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name’s sake hast labored, and hast not fainted.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Nevertheless, I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Remember therefore from whence thou hast fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come to thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of its place, except thou repent.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And to the angel of the church in Smyrna, write; These things saith the first and the last, who was dead, and is alive;</verse>
  <verse number="9">I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them who say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer. Behold, the devil will cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days. Be thou faithful to death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches; He that overcometh, shall not be hurt by the second death.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he who hath the sharp sword with two edges;</verse>
  <verse number="13">I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan’s seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit lewdness.</verse>
  <verse number="15">So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Repent; or else I will come to thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth, he excepted, that receiveth it.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;</verse>
  <verse number="19">I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first:</verse>
  <verse number="20">Notwithstanding, I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, who calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit lewdness, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And I gave her time to repent of her lewdness, and she repented not.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he who searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give to every one of you according to your works.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, As many as have not this doctrine, and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you no other burden:</verse>
  <verse number="25">But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works to the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</verse>
  <verse number="27">(And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers:) even as I received of my Father.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And I will give him the morning-star.</verse>
  <verse number="29">He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.</verse>
