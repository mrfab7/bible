<chapter book="Job" number="33" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Therefore, hear my speeches, Job, and listen to all my words.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Behold, I have opened my mouth; let my tongue speak along with my throat.</verse>
  <verse number="3">My words are from my simple heart, and my lips will speak a pure judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The Spirit of God made me, and the breath of the Almighty gave me life.</verse>
  <verse number="5">If you can, answer me, and oppose me to my face.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Behold, God has made me, just as he also has made you, and I, likewise, have been formed of the same clay.</verse>
  <verse number="7">So, truly, do not let my wonders terrify you, and do not let my eloquence be burdensome to you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of your words, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="9">“I am clean and without sin; I am immaculate, and there is no iniquity in me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Yet he has discovered blame in me, and so he has treated me like his enemy.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He has put my feet in fetters; he has kept watch over all my ways.”</verse>
  <verse number="12">Therefore, it is for this reason that you have not been justified. For I tell you that God is greater than man.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Do you contend against him because he has not responded to all of your words?</verse>
  <verse number="14">God speaks once, and he does not repeat the same thing a second time.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Through a dream in a vision of the night, when a deep sleep falls over men, and they are sleeping in their beds,</verse>
  <verse number="16">then, he opens the ears of men, and, educating them, he teaches discipline,</verse>
  <verse number="17">so that he may divert a man from the things that he is doing, and may free him from pride,</verse>
  <verse number="18">rescuing his soul from corruption and his life from passing away by the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Likewise, he rebukes by sorrow in bed, and he causes all of his bones to become weak.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Bread becomes abominable to him in his life, and, to his soul, the meat which before he desired.</verse>
  <verse number="21">His body will waste away, and his bones, which had been covered, will be revealed.</verse>
  <verse number="22">His soul has approached corruption, and his life has drawn near to what is deadly.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If there were an angel speaking for him, one among thousands, to declare the fairness of the man,</verse>
  <verse number="24">he will have mercy on him, and he will say, “Free him, so that he will not descend to destruction. I have found a reason to be favorable to him.</verse>
  <verse number="25">His body is consumed by suffering. Let him return to the days of his youth.”</verse>
  <verse number="26">He will beg pardon from God, and he will be soothing to him; and he will look upon his face in jubilation, and he will restore his justice to man.</verse>
  <verse number="27">He will consider mankind, and he will say: “I have sinned and truly I have offended, yet I was not treated as I deserved.”</verse>
  <verse number="28">He has freed his soul from continuing into destruction, so that, in living, it may see the light.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Behold, all these things God works three times within each one,</verse>
  <verse number="30">so that he may revive their souls from corruption and enlighten them with the light of life.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Pay attention Job, and listen to me; and remain silent, while I speak.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Yet, if you have anything to say, answer me and speak, for I want you to be treated justly.</verse>
  <verse number="33">But if you do not have anything to say, then listen to me. Be quiet and I will teach you wisdom.</verse>
