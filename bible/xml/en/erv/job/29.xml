<chapter book="Job" number="29" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And Job again took up his parable, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Oh that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me;</verse>
  <verse number="3">When his lamp shined upon my head, and by his light I walked through darkness;</verse>
  <verse number="4">As I was in the ripeness of my days, when the secret of God was upon my tent;</verse>
  <verse number="5">When the Almighty was yet with me, and my children were about me;</verse>
  <verse number="6">When my steps were washed with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil!</verse>
  <verse number="7">When I went forth to the gate unto the city, when I prepared my seat in the street,</verse>
  <verse number="8">The young men saw me and hid themselves, and the aged rose up and stood;</verse>
  <verse number="9">The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth;</verse>
  <verse number="10">The voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness unto me:</verse>
  <verse number="12">Because I delivered the poor that cried, the fatherless also, that had none to help him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my justice was as a robe and a diadem.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I was a father to the needy: and the cause of him that I knew not I searched out.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And I brake the jaws of the unrighteous, and plucked the prey out of his teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand:</verse>
  <verse number="19">My root is spread out to the waters, and the dew lieth all night upon my branch:</verse>
  <verse number="20">My glory is fresh in me, and my bow is renewed in my hand.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence for my counsel.</verse>
  <verse number="22">After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.</verse>
  <verse number="24">If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.</verse>
  <verse number="25">I chose out their way, and sat as chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.</verse>
