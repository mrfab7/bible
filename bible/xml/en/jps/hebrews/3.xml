<chapter book="Hebrews" number="3" translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" translationID="jps" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Therefore, holy brethren, sharers with others in a heavenly invitation, fix your thoughts on Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest whose followers we profess to be.</verse>
  <verse number="2">How faithful He was to Him who appointed Him, just as Moses also was faithful in all God’s house!</verse>
  <verse number="3">For Jesus has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, in so far as he who has built a house has higher honour than the house itself.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For every house has had a builder, and the builder of all things is God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Moreover, Moses was faithful in all God’s house as a servant in delivering the message given him to speak;</verse>
  <verse number="6">but Christ was faithful as a Son having authority over God’s house, and we are that house, if we hold firm to the End the boldness and the hope which we boast of as ours.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For this reason—as the Holy Spirit warns us, “To-day, if you hear His voice,</verse>
  <verse number="8">do not harden your hearts as your forefathers did in the time of the provocation on the day of the temptation in the Desert,</verse>
  <verse number="9">where your forefathers so sorely tried My patience and saw all that I did during forty years.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore I was greatly grieved with that generation, and I said, ‘They are ever going astray in heart, and have not learnt to know My paths.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">As I swore in My anger, they shall not be admitted to My rest”—</verse>
  <verse number="12">see to it, brethren, that there is never in any one of you—as perhaps there may be—a sinful and unbelieving heart, manifesting itself in revolt from the ever-living God.</verse>
  <verse number="13">On the contrary encourage one another, day after day, so long as To-day lasts, so that not one of you may be hardened through the deceitful character of sin.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For we have, all alike, become sharers with Christ, if we really hold our first confidence firm to the End;</verse>
  <verse number="15">seeing that the warning still comes to us, “To-day, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as your forefathers did in the time of the provocation.”</verse>
  <verse number="16">For who were they that heard, and yet provoked God? Was it not the whole of the people who had come out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses?</verse>
  <verse number="17">And with whom was God so greatly grieved for forty years? Was it not with those who had sinned, and whose dead bodies fell in the Desert?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And to whom did He swear that they should not be admitted to His rest, if it was not to those who were disobedient?</verse>
  <verse number="19">And so we see that it was owing to lack of faith that they could not be admitted.</verse>
