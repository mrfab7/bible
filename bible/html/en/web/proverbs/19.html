<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Better is the poor who walks in his integrity than he who is perverse in his lips and is a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">It isn’t good to have zeal without knowledge; nor being hasty with one’s feet and missing the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The foolishness of man subverts his way; his heart rages against Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Wealth adds many friends, but the poor is separated from his friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A false witness shall not be unpunished. He who pours out lies shall not go free.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Many will entreat the favor of a ruler, and everyone is a friend to a man who gives gifts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All the relatives of the poor shun him: how much more do his friends avoid him! He pursues them with pleas, but they are gone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He who gets wisdom loves his own soul. He who keeps understanding shall find good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A false witness shall not be unpunished. He who utters lies shall perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Delicate living is not appropriate for a fool, much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger. It is his glory to overlook an offense.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The king’s wrath is like the roaring of a lion, but his favor is like dew on the grass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A foolish son is the calamity of his father. A wife’s quarrels are a continual dripping.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">House and riches are an inheritance from fathers, but a prudent wife is from Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep. The idle soul shall suffer hunger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul, but he who is contemptuous in his ways shall die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He who has pity on the poor lends to Yahweh; he will reward him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Discipline your son, for there is hope; don’t be a willing party to his death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A hot-tempered man must pay the penalty, for if you rescue him, you must do it again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Listen to counsel and receive instruction, that you may be wise in your latter end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">There are many plans in a man’s heart, but Yahweh’s counsel will prevail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">That which makes a man to be desired is his kindness. A poor man is better than a liar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The fear of Yahweh leads to life, then contentment; he rests and will not be touched by trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; he will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Flog a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; rebuke one who has understanding, and he will gain knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He who robs his father and drives away his mother, is a son who causes shame and brings reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">If you stop listening to instruction, my son, you will stray from the words of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A corrupt witness mocks justice, and the mouth of the wicked gulps down iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Penalties are prepared for scoffers, and beatings for the backs of fools.</p>
