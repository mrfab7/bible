  <verse number="1">NOW concerning the collections that are made for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, so do ye also.</verse>
  <verse number="2">On the first day of the week let every one of you put apart with himself, laying up what it shall well please him; that when I come, the collections be not then to be made.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And when I shall be with you, whomsoever you shall approve by letters, them will I send to carry your grace to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And if it be meet that I also go, they shall go with me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now I will come to you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia. For I shall pass through Macedonia.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And with you perhaps I shall abide, or even spend the winter: that you may bring me on my way whithersoever I shall go.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For I will not see you now by the way, for I trust that I shall abide with you some time, if the Lord permit.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For a great door and evident is opened unto me: and many adversaries.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Now if Timothy come, see that he be with you without fear, for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Let no man therefore despise him, but conduct ye him on his way in peace: that he may come to me. For I look for him with the breatheren.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And touching our brother Apollo, I give you to understand, that I much entreated him to come unto you with the breatheren: and indeed it was not his will at all to come at this time. But he will come when he shall have leisure.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Watch ye, stand fast in the faith,do manfully, and be strengthened.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Let all your things be done in charity.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And I beseech you, brethren, you know the house of Stephanas, and of Fortunatus, and of Achaicus, that they are the firstfruits of Achaia, and have dedicated themselves to the ministry of the saints:</verse>
  <verse number="16">That you also be subject to such, and to every one that worketh with us, and laboureth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And I rejoice in the presence of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus, because that which was wanting on your part, they have supplied.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For they have refreshed both my spirit and yours. Know them, therefore, that are such.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house, with whom I also lodge.</verse>
  <verse number="20">All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with a holy kiss.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The salutation of me Paul, with my own hand.</verse>
  <verse number="22">If any man love not our Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema, maranatha.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</verse>
  <verse number="24">My charity be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</verse>
