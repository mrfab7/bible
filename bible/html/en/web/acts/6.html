<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, a complaint arose from the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily service.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, “It is not appropriate for us to forsake the word of God and serve tables.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Therefore select from among you, brothers, seven men of good report, full of the Holy Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">These words pleased the whole multitude. They chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">whom they set before the apostles. When they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The word of God increased and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem exceedingly. A great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Stephen, full of faith and power, performed great wonders and signs among the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But some of those who were of the synagogue called “The Libertines,” and of the Cyrenians, of the Alexandrians, and of those of Cilicia and Asia arose, disputing with Stephen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They weren’t able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Then they secretly induced men to say, “We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes, and came against him and seized him, and brought him in to the council,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and set up false witnesses who said, “This man never stops speaking blasphemous words against this holy place and the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place, and will change the customs which Moses delivered to us.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All who sat in the council, fastening their eyes on him, saw his face like it was the face of an angel.</p>
