  <verse number="1">I AM a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.</verse>
  <verse number="2">As a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.</verse>
  <verse number="3">As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Stay ye me with raisins, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.</verse>
  <verse number="6">His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awaken love, until it please.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh, leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.</verse>
  <verse number="9">My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh in at the windows, he sheweth himself through the lattice.</verse>
  <verse number="10">My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;</verse>
  <verse number="12">The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;</verse>
  <verse number="13">The fig tree ripeneth her green figs, and the vines are in blossom, they give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</verse>
  <verse number="14">O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the steep place, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice: for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vineyards; for our vineyards are in blossom.</verse>
  <verse number="16">My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth his flock among the lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Until the day be cool, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.</verse>
