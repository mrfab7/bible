<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear mine utterances, and hearken to all my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Behold now, I have opened my mouth, my tongue speaketh in my palate,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart, and my lips shall utter knowledge purely.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If thou canst, answer me; array [thy words] before me: take thy stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Behold, before God I am as thou; I also am formed out of the clay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, nor my burden be heavy upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of [thy] words:—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I am clean without transgression; I am pure, and there is no iniquity in me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Lo, he findeth occasions of hostility against me, he counteth me for his enemy;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Behold, I will answer thee in this, thou art not right; for +God is greater than man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For God speaketh once, and twice,—[and man] perceiveth it not—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Then he openeth men’s ears, and sealeth their instruction,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">That he may withdraw man [from his] work, and hide pride from man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from passing away by the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and with constant strife in his bones;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty food;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His flesh is consumed away from view, and his bones that were not seen stick out;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And his soul draweth near to the pit, and his life to the destroyers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his duty;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Then he will be gracious unto him, and say, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">His flesh shall be fresher than in childhood; he shall return to the days of his youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He shall pray unto +God, and he will receive him with favour; and he shall see his face with shoutings, and he will render unto man his righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He will sing before men, and say, I have sinned, and perverted what was right, and it hath not been requited to me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He hath delivered my soul from going into the pit, and my life shall see the light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Lo, all these [things] worketh God twice, thrice, with man,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">To bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Mark well, Job, hearken unto me; be silent, and I will speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">If thou hast anything to say, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If not, hearken thou unto me; be silent, and I will teach thee wisdom.</p>
