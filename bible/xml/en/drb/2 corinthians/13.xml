  <verse number="1">Behold, this is the third time I am coming to you: In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word stand.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I have told before, and foretell, as present, and now absent, to them that sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Do you seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me, who towards you is not weak, but is mighty in you?</verse>
  <verse number="4">For although he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him: but we shall live with him by the power of God towards you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Try your own selves if you be in the faith; prove ye yourselves. Know you not your own selves, that Christ Jesus is in you, unless perhaps you be reprobates?</verse>
  <verse number="6">But I trust that you shall know that we are not reprobates.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now we pray God, that you may do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do that which is good, and that we may be as reprobates.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For we can do nothing against the truth; but for the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For we rejoice that we are weak, and you are strong. This also we pray for, your perfection.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore I write these things, being absent, that, being present, I may not deal more severely, according to the power which the Lord hath given me unto edification, and not unto destruction.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the rest, brethren, rejoice, be perfect, take exhortation, be of one mind, have peace; and the God of peace and of love shall be with you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Salute one another with a holy kiss.</verse>
  <verse number="13">All the saints salute you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the charity of God, and the communication of the Holy Ghost be with you all. Amen.</verse>
