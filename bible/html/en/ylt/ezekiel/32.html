<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And it cometh to pass, in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first of the month, hath a word of Jehovah been unto me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Son of man, lift up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and thou hast said unto him: A young lion of nations thou hast been like, And thou art as a dragon in the seas, And thou comest forth with thy flowings, And dost trouble the waters with thy feet, And thou dost foul their flowings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: And—I have spread out for thee My net, With an assembly of many peoples, And they have brought thee up in My net.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I have left thee in the land, On the face of the field I do cast thee out, And have caused to dwell upon thee every fowl of the heavens, And have satisfied out of thee the beasts of the whole earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And I have put thy flesh on the mountains, And filled the valleys with thy hugeness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And watered the land with thy flowing, From thy blood—unto the mountains, And streams are filled from thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And in quenching thee I have covered the heavens, And have made black their stars, The sun with a cloud I do cover, And the moon causeth not its light to shine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">All luminaries of light in the heavens, I make black over thee, And I have given darkness over thy land, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And I have vexed the heart of many peoples, In My bringing in thy destruction among nations, Unto lands that thou hast not known.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I have made many peoples astonished at thee, And their kings are afraid at thee with trembling, In My brandishing My sword before their faces, And they have trembled every moment, Each for his life—in the day of thy fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For thus said the Lord Jehovah: A sword of the king of Babylon entereth thee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">By swords of the mighty I cause thy multitude to fall, The terrible of nations—all of them, And they have spoiled the excellency of Egypt, And destroyed hath been all her multitude.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And I have destroyed all her beasts, From beside many waters, And trouble them not doth a foot of man any more, Yea, the hoofs of beasts trouble them not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then do I cause their waters to sink, And their rivers as oil I cause to go, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">In My making the land of Egypt a desolation, And desolated hath been the land of its fulness, In My smiting all the inhabitants in it, And they have known that I am Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A lamentation it is, and they have lamented her, Daughters of the nations do lament her, For Egypt, and for all her multitude, they lament her, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And it cometh to pass, in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth of the month, hath a word of Jehovah been unto me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">‘Son of man, Wail for the multitude of Egypt, And cause it to go down, It—and the daughters of honourable nations, Unto the earth—the lower parts, With those going down to the pit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Than whom hast thou been more pleasant? Go down, and be laid with the uncircumcised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In the midst of the pierced of the sword they fall, To the sword she hath been given, They drew her out, and all her multitude.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Speak to him do the gods of the mighty out of the midst of sheol, With his helpers—they have gone down, They have lain with the uncircumcised, The pierced of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">There is Asshur, and all her assembly, Round about him are his graves, All of them are wounded, who are falling by sword,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Whose graves are appointed in the sides of the pit, And her assembly is round about her grave, All of them wounded, falling by sword, Because they gave terror in the land of the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">There is Elam, and all her multitude, Round about is her grave, All of them wounded, who are falling by sword, Who have gone down uncircumcised unto the earth—the lower parts, Because they gave their terror in the land of the living, And they bear their shame with those going down to the pit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">In the midst of the wounded they have appointed a bed for her with all her multitude, Round about him are her graves, All of them uncircumcised, pierced of the sword, For their terror was given in the land of the living, And they bear their shame with those going down to the pit, In the midst of the pierced he hath been put.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude, Round about him are her graves, All of them uncircumcised, pierced of the sword, For they gave their terror in the land of the living,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And they lie not with the mighty, Who are falling of the uncircumcised, Who have gone down to sheol with their weapons of war, And they put their swords under their heads, And their iniquities are on their bones, For the terror of the mighty is in the land of the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And thou, in the midst of the uncircumcised art broken, And dost lie with the pierced of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, Who have been given up in their might, With the pierced of the sword, They with the uncircumcised do lie, And with those going down to the pit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">There are princes of the north, All of them, and every Zidonian, Who have gone down with the pierced in their terror, Of their might they are ashamed, And they lie uncircumcised with the pierced of the sword, And they bear their shame with those going down to the pit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Then doth Pharaoh see, And he hath been comforted for all his multitude, The pierced of the sword—Pharaoh and all his force, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For I have given his terror in the land of the living, And he hath been laid down in the midst of the uncircumcised, With the pierced of the sword—Pharaoh, and all his multitude, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah!’</p>
