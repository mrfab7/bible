<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I ate not from it in my mourning, and I took not away from it in uncleanness, and I gave not from it to the dead: I heard to the voice of Jehovah my God, I did according to all thou didst command me.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Thou saidst this day Jehovah to be to thee for God, and to go in his ways, and to watch his laws and his commands, and his judgments, and to hear to his voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Jehovah said thee this day to be to him for a people of property, as he spake to thee, and to watch all his commands,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And to give thee high above all the nations which he made for a beginning and for a name, and for an ornament, and for thy being a holy people to Jehovah thy God, as he spake.</p>
