<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the festival of unleavened drew near, called the Pascha.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Satan came into Judas called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And having departed, he conversed with the chief priests and the generals, how he might deliver him to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And they rejoiced, and agreed to give him silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he promised, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them apart from the crowd.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the day of unleavened came, in which must be sacrificed the pascha.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he sent Peter and John, saying, Having gone, prepare ye for us the pascha, that we might eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And they said to him, Where wilt thou that we should prepare?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he said to them, Behold, you having come to the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing an earthen vessel of water; follow ye him to the house where he goes in.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And ye shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher says to thee, Where is the room where I should eat the pascha with my disciples?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And he shall shew you a great upper room spread: there prepare ye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And having departed, they found as he said to them; and they prepared the pascha.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And when it was the hour, he reclined, and the twelve sent with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he said to them, With eager desire have I desired to eat this pascha with you before I suffer:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For I say to you, no more should I eat of it, till when it should be completed in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Having taken the cup, and returned thanks, he said, Take this, and divide among yourselves:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For I say to you, that I drink not of the fruit of the vine, till when the kingdom of God comes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Having taken the bread, and returned thanks, he brake, and gave them, saying, This is my body given for you: this do ye for my remembrance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Likewise also the cup after supping, saying, This the cup, the new covenant in my blood, poured out for you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But, behold, the hand of him delivering me up with me at the table.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And truly the Son of man goes according to that determined: but woe to that man by whom he is delivered up!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And they began to seek together among themselves, which of them it should be that was about to do this thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And a love of strife was in them, which of them thinks to be the greater.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And he said to them, The kings of the nations rule over them; and they exercising power over them are called benefactors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And ye not so: but let the greater with you be as the younger; and he leading, as he serving.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For which the greater, he reclining, or he serving? is not he reclining and I am in the midst of you as he serving.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And ye are they having remained with me in my temptations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And I set to you, as my Father set to me, a kingdom;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">That ye might eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and might sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded you, to sift as wheat:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And I have supplicated for thee that thy faith fail not: and thou, when having turned back, confirm thy brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And he said to him, Lord, with thee am I ready to go, and to prison, and to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And he said, I say to thee, Peter, the cock shall not utter a sound this day, before thou shalt thrice deny knowing me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did ye want any thing? And they said, Nothing,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Then said he to them, But now, he having a purse, let him take up, and likewise a wallet: and he not having, let him sell his garment, and buy a sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">For I say to you, that this written must yet be finished in me, that, Also was he reckoned with the lawless: for also the things concerning me have an end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And they said, Lord, behold, two swords here. And he said to them, It is enough.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And having come out, he went, according to custom, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples followed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And being at the place, he said to them, Pray ye not to enter into temptation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And he was removed from them about a stoneâ€™s cast, and having placed the knees, he prayed,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">Saying, Father, If thou art willing, turn aside this cup from me: but not my will, but thine, be done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And a messenger was seen to him from heaven, strengthening him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And being in a violent struggle, he prayed more intently: and his sweat was as clots of blood coming down upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">And having risen from prayer, having come to his disciples, he found them sleeping from grief;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">And he said to them, Why sleep ye? having risen, pray that ye might not enter into temptation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">And he yet speaking, Behold a crowd, and he called Judas, one of the twelve, came before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">And Jesus said to him, Judas, deliverest thou up the Son of man with a kiss?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">And they about him, having seen that, going to be, said to him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">And a certain one of them struck a servant of the chief priest, and took away his right ear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">And Jesus having answered said, Allow ye even to this. And having touched his ear, he healed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">And Jesus said to the chief priests, and generals of the temple, and the elders, having come to him, Have ye come out, as upon a robber, with sword and sticks?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">I being with you daily in the temple, ye stretched not forth the hands upon me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">And having taken, they brought him into the house of the chief priest. And Peter followed him far off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">And having kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and they having sat down together, Peter sat down in the midst of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">And a certain young girl having seen him sitting by the light, and looked intently upon him, said, And this was with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="57">And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="58">And after a little another having seen him, said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="59">And about the space of one hour a certain other assured himself, saying, of a truth this also was with him: for he is a Galilean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="60">And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, he yet speaking, the cock uttered a sound.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="61">And the Lord having turned, looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him, That before the cock utters a sound, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="62">And Peter having come forth without wept bitterly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="63">And the men holding Jesus mocked him, stripping.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="64">And having covered him, they struck his face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy who it is having struck thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="65">And many other things, blaspheming, they spake against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="66">And when it was day, the council of elders of the people was gathered together, and the chief priests and scribes, and they brought him to their council,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="67">Saying, Art thou Christ? tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye would not believe:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="68">And if I ask you, ye would not answer me, or loose me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="69">From now shall the Son of man be sitting from the right hand of the power of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="70">And they all said, Art thou therefore the Son of God? And he said to them, Ye say that I am.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="71">And they said, Why have we yet need of testimony? for we ourselves have heard from his month.</p>
