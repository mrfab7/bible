<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And a certain centurion’s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth [it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare [him] stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And John calling [unto him] two of his disciples sent [them] to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And in that same hour he cured many of [their] infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many [that were] blind he gave sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And blessed is [he], whosoever shall not be offended in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings’ courts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">This is [he], of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And all the people that heard [him], and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">But wisdom is justified of all her children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that [Jesus] sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And stood at his feet behind [him] weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe [them] with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed [them] with the ointment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw [it], he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman [this is] that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">Simon answered and said, I suppose that [he], to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped [them] with the hairs of her head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, [the same] loveth little.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.</p>
