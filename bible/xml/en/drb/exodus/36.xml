  <verse number="1">Beseleel, therefore, and Ooliab, and every wise man, to whom the Lord gave wisdom and understanding, to know how to work artificially, made the things that are necessary for the uses of the sanctuary, and which the Lord commanded.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And when Moses had called them, and every skilful man, to whom the Lord had given wisdom, and such as of their own accord had offered themselves to the making of the work,</verse>
  <verse number="3">He delivered all the offerings of the children of Israel unto them. And while they were earnest about the work, the people daily in the morning offered their vows.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Whereupon the workmen being constrained to come,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Said to Moses: The people offereth more than is necessary.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Moses therefore commanded proclamation to be made by the crier’s voice: Let neither man nor woman offer any more for the work of the sanctuary. And so they ceased from offering gifts,</verse>
  <verse number="7">Because the things that were offered did suffice, and were too much.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And all the men that were wise of heart, to accomplish the work of the tabernacle, made ten curtains of twisted fine linen, and violet, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, with varied work, and the art of embroidering:</verse>
  <verse number="9">The length of one curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth four: all the curtains were of the same size.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And he joined five curtains, one to another, and the other five he coupled one to another.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He made also loops of violet in the edge of the curtain on both sides, and in the edge of the other curtain in like manner,</verse>
  <verse number="12">That the loops might meet on against another, and might be joined each with the other.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Whereupon also he cast fifty rings of gold, that might catch the loops of the curtains, and they might be made one tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He made also eleven curtains of goats’ hair, to cover the roof of the tabernacle:</verse>
  <verse number="15">One curtain was thirty cubits long and four cubits broad: all the curtains were of one measure.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Five of which he joined apart, and the other six apart.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he made fifty loops in the edge of one curtain, and fifty in the edge of another curtain, that they might be joined one to another.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And fifty buckles of brass wherewith the roof might be knit together, that of all the curtains there might be made one covering.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He made also a cover for the tabernacle of rams’ skins dyed red: and another cover over that of violet skins.</verse>
  <verse number="20">He made also the boards of the tabernacle of setim wood standing.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The length of one board was ten cubits: and the breadth was one cubit and a half.</verse>
  <verse number="22">There were two mortises throughout every board, that one might be joined to the other. And in this manner he made for all the boards of the tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Of which twenty were at the south side southward,</verse>
  <verse number="24">With forty sockets of silver, two sockets were put under one board on the two sides of the corners, where the mortises of the sides end in the corners.</verse>
  <verse number="25">At that side also of the tabernacle, that looketh toward the north, he made twenty boards.</verse>
  <verse number="26">With forty sockets of silver, two sockets for every board.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But against the west, to wit, at that side of the tabernacle, which looketh to the sea, he made six boards,</verse>
  <verse number="28">And two others at each corner of the tabernacle behind:</verse>
  <verse number="29">Which were also joined from beneath unto the top, and went together into one joint. Thus he did on both sides at the corners:</verse>
  <verse number="30">So there were in all eight boards and they had sixteen sockets of silver, to wit, two sockets under every board.</verse>
  <verse number="31">He made also bars of setim wood, five to hold together the boards of one side of the tabernacle,</verse>
  <verse number="32">And five others to join together the boards of the other side: and besides these, five other bars at the west side of the tabernacle towards the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="33">He made also another bar, that might come by the midst of the boards from corner to corner.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And the board works themselves he overlaid with gold, casting for them sockets of silver. And their rings he made of gold, through which the bars might be drawn: and he covered the bars themselves with plates of gold.</verse>
  <verse number="35">He made also a veil of violet, and purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen, varied and distinguished with embroidery:</verse>
  <verse number="36">And four pillars of setim wood, which with their heads be overlaid with gold, casting for them sockets of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="37">He made also a hanging in the entry of the tabernacle of violet, purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen, with the work of an embroiderer.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And five pillars with their heads, which he covered with gold, and their sockets he cast of brass.</verse>
