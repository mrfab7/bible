<chapter book="2 Thessalonians" number="2" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now we beg you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to him,</verse>
  <verse number="2">that ye be not soon shaken in mind, nor troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as [if it were] by us, as that the day of the Lord is present.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Let not any one deceive you in any manner, because [it will not be] unless the apostasy have first come, and the man of sin have been revealed, the son of perdition;</verse>
  <verse number="4">who opposes and exalts himself on high against all called God, or object of veneration; so that he himself sits down in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Do ye not remember that, being yet with you, I said these things to you?</verse>
  <verse number="6">And now ye know that which restrains, that he should be revealed in his own time.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For the mystery of lawlessness already works; only [there is] he who restrains now until he be gone,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and then the lawless one shall be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus shall consume with the breath of his mouth, and shall annul by the appearing of his coming;</verse>
  <verse number="9">whose coming is according to the working of Satan in all power and signs and wonders of falsehood,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and in all deceit of unrighteousness to them that perish, because they have not received the love of the truth that they might be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And for this reason God sends to them a working of error, that they should believe what is false,</verse>
  <verse number="12">that all might be judged who have not believed the truth, but have found pleasure in unrighteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved of [the] Lord, that God has chosen you from [the] beginning to salvation in sanctification of [the] Spirit and belief of [the] truth:</verse>
  <verse number="14">whereto he has called you by our glad tidings, to [the] obtaining of [the] glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="15">So then, brethren, stand firm, and hold fast the instructions which ye have been taught, whether by word or by our letter.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and our God and Father, who has loved us, and given [us] eternal consolation and good hope by grace,</verse>
  <verse number="17">encourage your hearts, and establish you in every good work and word.</verse>
