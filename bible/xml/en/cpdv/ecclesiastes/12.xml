<chapter book="Ecclesiastes" number="12" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Remember your Creator in the days of your youth, before the time of affliction arrives and the years draw near, about which you will say, “These do not please me.”</verse>
  <verse number="2">Before the sun, and the light, and the moon, and the stars are darkened and the clouds return after the rain,</verse>
  <verse number="3">when the guardians of the house will tremble, and the strongest men will waver, and those who grind grain will be idle, except for a small number, and those who look through the keyholes will be darkened.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they will close the doors to the street, when the voice of he who grinds the grain will be humbled, and they will be disturbed at the sound of a flying thing, and all the daughters of song shall become deaf.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Likewise, they will fear the things above them, and they will dread the way. The almond tree will flourish; the locust will be fattened; and the caper plant will scattered, because man shall go into the house of his eternity, and the mourners shall wander around in the street.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Before the silver cord is broken, and the golden band pulls away, and the pitcher is crushed over the fountain, and the wheel is broken above the cistern,</verse>
  <verse number="7">and the dust returns to its earth, from which it was, and the spirit returns to God, who granted it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Vanity of vanities, said Ecclesiastes, and all is vanity!</verse>
  <verse number="9">And since Ecclesiastes was very wise, he taught the people, and he described what he had accomplished. And while searching, he composed many parables.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He sought useful words, and he wrote most righteous words, which were full of truth.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The words of the wise are like a goad, and like nails deeply fastened, which, through the counsel of teachers, are set forth by one pastor.</verse>
  <verse number="12">You should require no more than this, my son. For there is no end to the making of many books. And excessive study is an affliction to the flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Let us all listen together to the end of the discourse. Fear God, and observe his commandments. This is everything for man.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And so, for all that is done and for each error, God will bring judgment: whether it was good or evil.</verse>
