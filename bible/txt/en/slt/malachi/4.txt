1	For behold, the day coming, burning as a furnace; and all the proud and all doing injustice were straw: and the day coming burnt them, said Jehovah of armies, that it shall not leave to them root and branch.
2	And to you fearing my name the sun of justice arose, and healing in his wings; and ye went forth and spread as calves of the stall.
3	And ye tread down the unjust; for they were ashes under the soles of your feet in the day which I doing, said Jehovah of armies.
4	Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded him in Horeb for all Israel, the laws and the judgments.
5	Behold, I send to you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the day of Jehovah, great and terrible:
6	And he turned back the heart of the fathers to the sons, and the heart of the sons to the fathers, lest I shall come and strike the earth with utter destruction.
