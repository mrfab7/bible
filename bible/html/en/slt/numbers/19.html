<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah will speak to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">This is the law of the precept which to Jehovah commanded, saying, Speak the sons of Israel and they shall take to thee a red, blameless heifer, to which not a blemish in her, and which a yoke was not lifted up upon her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And give her to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring her forth without the camp, and slaughter her before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Eleazar the priest took from her blood with his finger, and sprinkled before the face of the tent of appointment, from her blood seven times.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And he burnt the heifer before his eyes; her skin and her flesh and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the priest took cedar wood and hyssop and double scarlet, and cast into the midst of the burning of the heifer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the priest washed his garments, and bathed his flesh in water, and afterward he shall go into the camp; and the priest was unclean till evening.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he burning her shall wash his garments in water, and bathed his flesh in water, and was unclean till the evening.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And a clean man gathered up the ashes of the heifer, and put without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be to the assembly of the sons of Israel for a preservation for a water of uncleanness: it is sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he gathering the ashes of the heifer washed his garments, and was unclean till the evening: and it shall be to the sons of Israel, and to the stranger sojourning in the midst of them, for a law forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He touching upon the dead of any soul of man and he was unclean seven days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He shall purify himself in the third day, and in the seventh day he shall be clean: and if he shall not be purified in the third day, in the seventh day he shall not be clean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">All touching upon the dead, upon the soul of man which shall die, and shall not be purified, defiled the dwelling of Jehovah; and that soul was cut off from Israel: for the water of uncleanness was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness yet upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">This the law of a man when he shall die in the tent; all going into the tent and all who are in the tent, shall be unclean seven days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And every vessel being open which a cord was not bound upon it, it is unclean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And every one who shall touch upon the face of the field, upon the wounded of the sword, or upon the dead, or upon the bone of man, or upon a grave, shall be unclean seven days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And they took for the unclean from the dust of the burning of sin, and living water was given upon it into a vessel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And a clean man took hyssop and dipped in water and sprinkled upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the souls which were there, and upon him touching upon a bone, or upon the wounded, or upon the the dead, or upon a grave:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And he being clean sprinkled upon the unclean in the third day, and in the seventh day: and he was cleansed in the seventh day, and he washed his garments and bathed in water, and was clean in the evening.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And a man who shall be unclean and shall not be purified, and that soul was cut off from the midst of the gathering, for he defiled the holy place of Jehovah: the water of uncleanness was not sprinkled upon him; he is unclean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And it was to them for a law forever, and he sprinkling the water of uncleanness shall wash his garments; and he touching upon the water of uncleanness shall be unclean till the evening.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And all which the unclean shall touch upon it, shall be unclean; and the soul touching shall be unclean till the evening.</p>
