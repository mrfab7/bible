  <verse number="1">The word that the LORD spake concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Declare ye among the nations and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is put to shame, Merodach is dismayed; her images are put to shame, her idols are dismayed.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they are fled, they are gone, both man and beast.</verse>
  <verse number="4">In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together; they shall go on their way weeping, and shall seek the LORD their God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come ye, and join yourselves to the LORD in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten.</verse>
  <verse number="6">My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their resting place.</verse>
  <verse number="7">All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he-goats before the flocks.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For, lo, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man; none shall return in vain.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Because ye are glad, because ye rejoice, O ye that plunder mine heritage, because ye are wanton as an heifer that treadeth out the corn, and neigh as strong horses;</verse>
  <verse number="12">your mother shall be sore ashamed; she that bare you shall be confounded: behold, she shall be the hindermost of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Shout against her round about; she hath submitted herself; her bulwarks are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the LORD; take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria;</verse>
  <verse number="19">And I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.</verse>
  <verse number="20">In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: slay and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.</verse>
  <verse number="22">A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.</verse>
  <verse number="23">How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!</verse>
  <verse number="24">I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for the Lord, the LORD of hosts, hath a work to do in the land of the Chaldeans.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Call together the archers against Babylon, all them that bend the bow; camp against her round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all her men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, saith the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Behold, I am against thee, O thou proud one, saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And the proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all that are round about him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Thus saith the LORD of hosts: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together: and all that took them captives hold them fast; they refuse to let them go.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Their redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.</verse>
  <verse number="35">A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.</verse>
  <verse number="36">A sword is upon the boasters, and they shall dote: a sword is upon her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.</verse>
  <verse number="37">A sword is upon their horse, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her, and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures, and they shall be robbed.</verse>
  <verse number="38">A drought is upon her waters, and they shall be dried up: for it is a land of graven images, and they are mad upon idols.</verse>
  <verse number="39">Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.</verse>
  <verse number="40">As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD; so shall no man dwell there, neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Behold, a people cometh from the north; and a great nation, and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="42">They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea, and they ride upon horses; every one set in array, as man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.</verse>
  <verse number="43">The king of Babylon hath heard the fame of them, and his hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of Jordan against the strong habitation: but I will suddenly make them run away from her; and whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over her: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd that will stand before me?</verse>
  <verse number="45">Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they shall drag them away, even the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.</verse>
  <verse number="46">At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembleth, and the cry is heard among the nations.</verse>
