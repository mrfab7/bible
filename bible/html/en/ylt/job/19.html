<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="19" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job answereth and saith:—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Till when do ye afflict my soul, And bruise me with words?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">These ten times ye put me to shame, ye blush not. Ye make yourselves strange to me—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And also—truly, I have erred, With me doth my error remain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If, truly, over me ye magnify yourselves, And decide against me my reproach;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Know now, that God turned me upside down, And His net against me hath set round,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Lo, I cry out—violence, and am not answered, I cry aloud, and there is no judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">My way He hedged up, and I pass not over, And on my paths darkness He placeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Mine honour from off me He hath stripped, And He turneth the crown from my head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He breaketh me down round about, and I go, And removeth like a tree my hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And He kindleth against me His anger, And reckoneth me to Him as His adversaries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Come in do His troops together, And they raise up against me their way, And encamp round about my tent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">My brethren from me He hath put far off, And mine acquaintances surely Have been estranged from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Ceased have my neighbours And my familiar friends have forgotten me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Sojourners of my house and my maids, For a stranger reckon me: An alien I have been in their eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">To my servant I have called, And he doth not answer, With my mouth I make supplication to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">My spirit is strange to my wife, And my favours to the sons of my mother’s womb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Also sucklings have despised me, I rise, and they speak against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Abominate me do all the men of my counsel, And those I have loved, Have been turned against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">To my skin and to my flesh Cleaved hath my bone, And I deliver myself with the skin of my teeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Pity me, pity me, ye my friends, For the hand of God hath stricken against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Why do you pursue me as God? And with my flesh are not satisfied?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Who doth grant now, That my words may be written? Who doth grant that in a book they may be graven?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">With a pen of iron and lead—For ever in a rock they may be hewn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">That—I have known my Redeemer, The Living and the Last, For the dust he doth rise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And after my skin hath compassed this body, Then from my flesh I see God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Whom I—I see on my side, And mine eyes have beheld, and not a stranger, Consumed have been my reins in my bosom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">But ye say, ‘Why do we pursue after him?’ And the root of the matter hath been found in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Be ye afraid because of the sword, For furious are the punishments of the sword, That ye may know that there is a judgment.</p>
