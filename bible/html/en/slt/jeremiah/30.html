<div class="chapter" data-book="Jeremiah" data-chapter="30" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, saying, Write for thee all the words which I spake to thee upon the writing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I turned back the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, said Jehovah: and I turned them back to the land which I gave to their fathers, and they shall inherit it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And these the words which Jehovah spake to Israel and to Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For thus said Jehovah; We heard the voice of fear and of terror, and not of peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Ask ye now, and see if a male brought forth? wherefore did I see every man his hands upon his loins as she bringing forth, and all faces were turned to paleness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Alas! for that day is great from none being like it: and this the time of straits to Jacob and he shall be saved from it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And it was in that day, says Jehovah of armies, I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and I will tear away thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And they served Jehovah their God, and David their king whom I will raise up to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And thou my servant Jacob shall not fear, says Jehovah, and thou Israel shalt not be dismayed: for behold me saving thee from far off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob turned back and rested, and was quiet, and none making afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For I am with thee, says Jehovah, to serve thee: for I will make a completion to all nations where I scattered thee there, but with thee I will not make a completion: and I corrected thee for judgment, and acquitting, I will not let thee go unpunished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For thus said Jehovah, Thy breaking is incurable, and thy blow sickly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">None judging thy judgment for binding up: no healing will come up to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">All loving thee forgat thee; they will not seek thee; for I struck thee the blow of an enemy, the correction of the cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; thy sins were strong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Why wilt thou cry for thy breaking? thy pain is incurable for the multitude of thine iniquity: thy sins were strong, I did these things to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For this, all consuming thee shall be consumed; and all thine adversaries, all of them shall go into captivity; and they spoiling thee, were for spoiling, and all plundering thee I will give to plunder.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For I will bring up healing to thee, and I will heal thee of thy blows, says Jehovah: for they called to thee an outcast: This is Zion, none seeking for her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Thus said Jehovah, Behold me turning back the captivity of Jacobâ€™s tents, and I will compassionate his habitations; and the city was built upon her hill, and the palace sat upon its judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And thanksgiving shall go forth from them, and the voice of those playing, and I multiplied them, and they shall not be few; and I honored them, and they shall not be small.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And their sons were as of old, and their testimony shall be prepared before me, and I reviewed upon all pressing them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And his mighty one was from himself, and his ruler shall go forth from his midst; and I caused him to draw near, and he came near to me: for who this pledging his heart to approach to me? says Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And ye were to me for a people, and I will be to you for God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Behold, the storm of Jehovah went forth with wrath, a cutting storm: it shall be hurled upon the head of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The burning of the anger of Jehovah shall not turn, back till his doing, and till his setting up the thoughts of his heart: in the last of the days ye shall have understanding in it.</p>
