<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And I returned and saw all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold, the tears of the oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors was power, and they had no comforter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Then I praised the dead who are already dead more than the living who are yet alive;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and more fortunate than both is he who hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I saw all labour, and all success of work, that it is manâ€™s jealousy of his neighbour. This also is vanity and pursuit of the wind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Better is a handful with quietness, than both hands full with labour and pursuit of the wind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I returned and saw vanity under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">There is one [alone] and without a second; also he hath neither son nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labour, neither is his eye satisfied with riches, and [he saith not], For whom then am I labouring, and depriving my soul of good? This also is vanity and a grievous occupation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and who hath not another to lift him up!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one alone be warm?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And if a [man] overpower the one, the two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Better is a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king, who knoweth no more how to be admonished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For out of the prison-house he came forth to reign, although he was born poor in his kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I saw all the living that walk under the sun, with the child, the second, that should stand up in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">[There is] no end of all the people, of all that stood before them; those however that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after the wind.</p>
