  <verse number="2">And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with the giver of usury to him.</verse>

  <verse number="7">The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the merryhearted do sigh.</verse>

  <verse number="12">In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For thus shall it be in the midst of the earth among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive tree, as the grape gleanings when the vintage is done.</verse>

  <verse number="18">And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the windows on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth do shake.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The earth is utterly broken, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.</verse>

  <verse number="23">Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients gloriously.</verse>
