  <verse number="1">After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Job answered:</verse>
  <verse number="3">“Let the day perish in which I was born, the night which said, ‘There is a boy conceived.’</verse>
  <verse number="4">Let that day be darkness. Don’t let God from above seek for it, neither let the light shine on it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own. Let a cloud dwell on it. Let all that makes black the day terrify it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it. Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. Let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Behold, let that night be barren. Let no joyful voice come therein.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Let the stars of its twilight be dark. Let it look for light, but have none, neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,</verse>
  <verse number="10">because it didn’t shut up the doors of my mother’s womb, nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="11">“Why didn’t I die from the womb? Why didn’t I give up the spirit when my mother bore me?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should nurse?</verse>
  <verse number="13">For now should I have lain down and been quiet. I should have slept, then I would have been at rest,</verse>
  <verse number="14">with kings and counselors of the earth, who built up waste places for themselves;</verse>
  <verse number="15">or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</verse>
  <verse number="16">or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, as infants who never saw light.</verse>
  <verse number="17">There the wicked cease from troubling. There the weary are at rest.</verse>
  <verse number="18">There the prisoners are at ease together. They don’t hear the voice of the taskmaster.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The small and the great are there. The servant is free from his master.</verse>
  <verse number="20">“Why is light given to him who is in misery, life to the bitter in soul,</verse>
  <verse number="21">Who long for death, but it doesn’t come; and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,</verse>
  <verse number="22">who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?</verse>
  <verse number="24">For my sighing comes before I eat. My groanings are poured out like water.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For the thing which I fear comes on me, That which I am afraid of comes to me.</verse>
  <verse number="26">I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; but trouble comes.”</verse>
