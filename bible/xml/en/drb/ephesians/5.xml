  <verse number="1">Be ye therefore followers of God, as most dear children;</verse>
  <verse number="2">And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath delivered himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odour of sweetness.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not so much as be named among you, as becometh saints:</verse>
  <verse number="4">Or obscenity, or foolish talking, or scurrility, which is to no purpose; but rather giving of thanks.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For know you this and understand, that no fornicator, or unclean, or covetous person (which is a serving of idols), hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Let no man deceive you with vain words. For because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the children of unbelief.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Be ye not therefore partakers with them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For you were heretofore darkness, but now light in the Lord. Walk then as children of the light.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For the fruit of the light is in all goodness, and justice, and truth;</verse>
  <verse number="10">Proving what is well pleasing to God:</verse>
  <verse number="11">And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For the things that are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the light; for all that is made manifest is light.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Wherefore he saith: Rise thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead: and Christ shall enlighten thee.</verse>
  <verse number="15">See therefore, brethren, how you walk circumspectly: not as unwise,</verse>
  <verse number="16">But as wise: redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Wherefore become not unwise, but understanding what is the will of God.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And be not drunk with wine, wherein is luxury; but be ye filled with the holy Spirit,</verse>
  <verse number="19">Speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual canticles, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord;</verse>
  <verse number="20">Giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God and the Father:</verse>
  <verse number="21">Being subject one to another, in the fear of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord:</verse>
  <verse number="23">Because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church. He is the saviour of his body.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church, and delivered himself up for it:</verse>
  <verse number="26">That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life:</verse>
  <verse number="27">That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any; such thing; but that it should be holy, and without blemish.</verse>
  <verse number="28">So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife, loveth himself.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also Christ doth the church:</verse>
  <verse number="30">Because we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</verse>
  <verse number="31">For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="32">This is a great sacrament; but I speak in Christ and in the church.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Nevertheless let every one of you in particular love his wife as himself: and let the wife fear her husband.</verse>
