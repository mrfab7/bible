  <verse number="1">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and that they profane not my holy name in those things which they hallow to me: I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Say to them, Whoever he be of all your seed among your generations, that goes to the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow to the LORD, having his uncleanness on him, that soul shall be cut off from my presence: I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="4">What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or has a running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoever touches any thing that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goes from him;</verse>
  <verse number="5">Or whoever touches any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatever uncleanness he has;</verse>
  <verse number="6">The soul which has touched any such shall be unclean until even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his flesh with water.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.</verse>
  <verse number="8">That which dies of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="9">They shall therefore keep my ordinance, lest they bear sin for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do sanctify them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his meat.</verse>
  <verse number="12">If the priest’s daughter also be married to a stranger, she may not eat of an offering of the holy things.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But if the priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and is returned to her father’s house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father’s meat: but there shall be no stranger eat thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof to it, and shall give it to the priest with the holy thing.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer to the LORD;</verse>
  <verse number="16">Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="18">Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say to them, Whatever he be of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer to the LORD for a burnt offering;</verse>
  <verse number="19">You shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But whatever has a blemish, that shall you not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And whoever offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a running sore, or scurvy, or scabbed, you shall not offer these to the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them on the altar to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Either a bullock or a lamb that has any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that may you offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.</verse>
  <verse number="24">You shall not offer to the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall you make any offering thereof in your land.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Neither from a stranger’s hand shall you offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="27">When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thereafter it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And whether it be cow, or ewe, you shall not kill it and her young both in one day.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And when you will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving to the LORD, offer it at your own will.</verse>
  <verse number="30">On the same day it shall be eaten up; you shall leave none of it until the morrow: I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Therefore shall you keep my commandments, and do them: I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Neither shall you profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,</verse>
  <verse number="33">That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD.</verse>
