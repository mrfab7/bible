<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I in my coming from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan, in the way, in yet a length of land to go to Ephrath: and I shall bury her there in the way of Ephrath; this the house of bread.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Joseph will take the two, Ephraim in his right hand from Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand from Israel’s right hand, and will draw near to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Israel will put forth his right hand, and will place upon Ephraim’s head, and he the small; and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, attending to his hands wisely; for Manasseh was the first-born.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he will bless Joseph, and will say, God, before whom my fathers went, Abraham and Isaak, the God having fed me, from ever since I was till this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The messenger redeeming me from all evil, shall bless the youths; and my name shall be called upon them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaak and they shall be increased into a multitude in the midst of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Joseph will see that his father will put his right hand upon Ephraim’s head, and it will be evil in his eyes: and he will take hold of his father’s hand to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And I gave to thee one shoulder over thy brethren, which I took from the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.</p>
