  <verse number="2">I spread forth my hands all the day to a perverse people, going the way not good, after their purposes.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The people irritating me to my face continually; sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense upon bricks;</verse>

  <verse number="7">Your iniquities and the iniquities of your fathers together, said Jehovah, who burnt incense upon the mountains, and upon the hills they reproached me: and I measured their former work upon their bosom.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thus said Jehovah, As the new wine will be found in the cluster, and he will say, Thou shalt not destroy it, for a blessing in it: thus will I do for sake of my servant, to not destroy them all.</verse>

  <verse number="12">And I numbered you to the sword, and ye all shall bend to the slaughter, because I called, and ye answered not: I spake and ye heard not; and ye will do evil in mine eyes, and in what I delighted not, ye chose.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah, Behold, my servants shall eat and ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink and ye shall thirst: behold, my servants shall rejoice, and ye shall be ashamed.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Behold, my servants shall shout from good of heart, but ye shall cry from pain of heart, and wail from breaking of spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And ye set down your name for a curse to my chosen: and the Lord Jehovah slaying thee, and he will call his servants another name.</verse>
  <verse number="16">That he praising himself in the earth shall praise himself in the true God; and he swearing in the earth, shall swear in the true God; for the former straits were forgotten, and because they were hid from mine eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For behold me creating new heavens and a new earth: and the former things shall not be remembered, and they shall not come upon the heart.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But be ye glad and rejoice even forever, for what I create: for behold me creating Jerusalem a joy, and her people a rejoicing.</verse>

  <verse number="23">They shall not labor in vain, and they shall not bring forth for terror; for they the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their offspring with them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And it was before they shall call, I will answer; they yet speaking, and I will hear.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The wolf and the lamb shall feed as one, and the lion and the ox shall eat straw, and the serpent, dust his bread. They shall not do evil, and they shall not destroy in all my holy mountain, said Jehovah.</verse>
