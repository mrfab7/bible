<p class="verse" data-verse="1">For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus in behalf of you Gentiles,â€”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">if so be that ye have heard of the dispensation of that grace of God which was given me to you-ward;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">how that by revelation was made known unto me the mystery, as I wrote afore in few words,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">whereby, when ye read, ye can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">to wit, that the Gentiles are fellow-heirs, and fellow-members of the body, and fellow-partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of that grace of God which was given me according to the working of his power.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given, to preach unto the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery which from all ages hath been hid in God who created all things;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places might be made known through the church the manifold wisdom of God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">in whom we have boldness and access in confidence through our faith in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Wherefore I ask that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which are your glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, that ye may be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inward man;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith; to the end that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">may be strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge, that ye may be filled unto all the fulness of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">unto him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus unto all generations for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
