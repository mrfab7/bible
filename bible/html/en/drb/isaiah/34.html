<p class="verse" data-verse="1">COME near, ye Gentiles, and hear, and hearken, ye people: let the earth hear, and all that is therein, the world, and every thing that cometh forth of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For the indignation of the Lord if upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies: he hath killed them, and delivered them to slaughter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Their slain shall be cast forth, and out of their carcasses shall rise a slink: the mountains shall be melted with their blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And all the host of the heavens shall pine away, and the heavens shall be folded together as a book: and all their host shall fall down as the leaf falleth from the vine, and from the fig tree.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For my sword is inebriated in heaven: behold it shall come down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my slaughter unto judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The sword of the Lord is filled with blood, it is made thick with the blood of lambs and buck goats, with the blood of rams full of marrow: for there is a victim of the Lord in Bosra and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the unicorns shall go down with them, and the bulls with the mighty: their land shall be soaked with blood, and their ground with the fat of fat ones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For it is the day of the vengeance of the Lord, the year of recompenses of the judgment of Sion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the ground thereof into brimstone: and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Night and day it shall not be quenched, the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste, none shall pass through it for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The bittern and ericius shall possess it: and the ibis and the raven shall dwell in it: and a line shall be stretched out upon it, to bring it to nothing, and a plummet, unto desolation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The nobles thereof shall not be there: they shall call rather upon the king, and all the princes thereof shall be nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And thorns and nettles shall grow up in its houses, and the thistle in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be the habitation of dragons, and the pasture of ostriches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And demons and monsters shall meet, and the hairy ones shall cry out one to another, there hath the lamia lain down, and found rest for herself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">There hath the ericius had its hole, and brought up its young ones, and hath dug round about, and cherished them in the shadow thereof: thither are the kites gathered together one to another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Search ye diligently in the book of the Lord, and read: not one of them was wanting, one hath not sought for the other: for that which proceedeth out of my mouth, he hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it to them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation they shall dwell therein.</p>
