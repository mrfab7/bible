<chapter book="1 Samuel" number="17" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongs to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array against the Philistines.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a valley between them.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he had an helmet of brass on his head, and he was armed with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand shekels of brass.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he had greaves of brass on his legs, and a target of brass between his shoulders.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one bearing a shield went before him.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them, Why are you come out to set your battle in array? am not I a Philistine, and you servants to Saul? choose you a man for you, and let him come down to me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him, then shall you be our servants, and serve us.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.</verse>
  <verse number="11">When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah, whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went among men for an old man in the days of Saul.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the three oldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab, and the third Shammah.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And David was the youngest: and the three oldest followed Saul.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father’s sheep at Bethlehem.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented himself forty days.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Jesse said to David his son, Take now for your brothers an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run to the camp of your brothers;</verse>
  <verse number="18">And carry these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand, and look how your brothers fare, and take their pledge.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him; and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the fight, and shouted for the battle.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array, army against army.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his brothers.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words: and David heard them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, and were sore afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the men of Israel said, Have you seen this man that is come up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father’s house free in Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that kills this Philistine, and takes away the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?</verse>
  <verse number="27">And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that kills him.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why came you down here? and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the naughtiness of your heart; for you are come down that you might see the battle.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?</verse>
  <verse number="30">And he turned from him toward another, and spoke after the same manner: and the people answered him again after the former manner.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And when the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And Saul said to David, You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him: for you are but a youth, and he a man of war from his youth.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And David said to Saul, Your servant kept his father’s sheep, and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the flock:</verse>
  <verse number="35">And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by his beard, and smote him, and slew him.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Your servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.</verse>
  <verse number="37">David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and the LORD be with you.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And Saul armed David with his armor, and he put an helmet of brass on his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And David girded his sword on his armor, and he assayed to go; for he had not proved it. And David said to Saul, I cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David put them off him.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd’s bag which he had, even in a money; and his sling was in his hand: and he drew near to the Philistine.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And the Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man that bore the shield went before him.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a fair countenance.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the field.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Then said David to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.</verse>
  <verse number="46">This day will the LORD deliver you into my hand; and I will smite you, and take your head from you; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day to the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saves not with sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD’s, and he will give you into our hands.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and drew near to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward the army to meet the Philistine.</verse>
  <verse number="49">And David put his hand in his bag, and took there a stone, and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell on his face to the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="50">So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was no sword in the hand of David.</verse>
  <verse number="51">Therefore David ran, and stood on the Philistine, and took his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines saw their champion was dead, they fled.</verse>
  <verse number="52">And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued the Philistines, until you come to the valley, and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even to Gath, and to Ekron.</verse>
  <verse number="53">And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.</verse>
  <verse number="54">And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.</verse>
  <verse number="55">And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I cannot tell.</verse>
  <verse number="56">And the king said, Inquire you whose son the stripling is.</verse>
  <verse number="57">And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="58">And Saul said to him, Whose son are you, you young man? And David answered, I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.</verse>
