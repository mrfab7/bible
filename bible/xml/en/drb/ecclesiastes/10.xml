  <verse number="1">Dying flies spoil the sweetness of the ointment. Wisdom and glory is more precious than a small and shortlived folly.</verse>
  <verse number="2">The heart of a wise man is in his right hand, and the heart of a fool is in his left hand.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Yea, and the fool when he walketh in the way, whereas be himself is a fool, esteemeth all men fools.</verse>
  <verse number="4">If the spirit of him that hath power, ascend upon thee, leave not thy place: because care will make the greatest sins to cease.</verse>
  <verse number="5">There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as it were by an error proceeding from the face of the prince:</verse>
  <verse number="6">A fool set in high dignity, and the rich sitting beneath.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I have seen servants upon horses: and princes walking on the ground as servants.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that breaketh a hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He that removeth stones, shall be hurt by them: and he that cutteth trees, shall be wounded by them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If the iron be blunt, and be not as before, but be made blunt, with much labour it shall be sharpened: and after industry shall follow wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If a serpent bite in silence, he is nothing better that backbiteth secretly.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The words of the mouth of a wise man are grace: but the lips of a fool shall throw him down headlong.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The beginning of his words is folly, and the end of his talk is a mischievous error.</verse>
  <verse number="14">A fool multiplieth words. A man cannot tell what hath been before him: and what shall be after him, who can tell him?</verse>
  <verse number="15">The labour of fools shall afflict them that know not how to go to the city.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and when the princes eat in the morning.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Blessed is the land, whose king is noble, and whose princes eat in due season for refreshment, and not for riotousness.</verse>
  <verse number="18">By slothfulness a building shall be brought down, and through the weakness of hands, the house shall drop through.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For laughter they make bread, and wine that the living may feast: and all things obey money.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Detract not the king, no not in thy thought; and speak not evil of the rich man in thy private chamber: because even the birds of the air will carry thy voice, and he that hath wings will tell what thou hast said.</verse>
