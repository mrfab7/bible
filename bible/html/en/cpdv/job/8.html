<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But Baldad the Suhite, responding, said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How long will you speak this way, so that the words of your mouth are like a changeable wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Does God supplant judgment, or does the Almighty subvert that which is just?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And if now your children have sinned against him, and he has dismissed them into the power of their iniquity,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">even so, you should arise early to God, so as to beseech the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If you approach with purity and honesty, he will quickly be attentive to you, and a peaceful life will repay your righteousness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">so much so that, if your former things were small, your latter things would be multiplied greatly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For inquire of the earliest generation, and investigate diligently the history of the fathers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">(of course, we are but of yesterday and are ignorant that our days on earth are like a shadow,)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and they will teach you; they will speak with you and will offer you the eloquence of their hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Can the marsh plant live without moisture? Or can sedges grow without water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When it is still in flower, and has not been pulled up by hand, it withers before all other plants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Just so are the ways of all who forget God, and the hope of the hypocrite will perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">His frenzy will not please him, and his faith will be like a spider’s web.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He will lean on his house, and it will not stand; he will prop it up, but it will not rise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He seems to have moisture before the sun arrives; and at sunrise, his sprout shoots forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">His roots will crowd together over a heap of stones, and among the stones he will remain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If someone is devoured right beside him, he will deny him and will say: “I do not know you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For this is the benefit of his way, that others in turn may spring up from the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">God will not discard the simple, nor will he extend his hand to the spiteful,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">even until your mouth is filled with laughter and your lips with rejoicing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Those who hate you, will be clothed with confusion, and the tabernacle of the impious will not continue.</p>
