<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And I said: Hear, I pray you, ye heads of Jacob, And rulers of the house of Israel: Is it not for you to know justice?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Who hate the good, and love the evil; Who rob their skin from off them, And their flesh from off their bones;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Who also eat the flesh of my people, And flay their skin from off them, And break their bones; Yea, they chop them in pieces, as that which is in the pot, And as flesh within the caldron.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Then shall they cry unto the LORD, But He will not answer them; Yea, He will hide His face from them at that time, According as they have wrought evil in their doings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people to err; That cry: ‘Peace’, when their teeth have any thing to bite; And whoso putteth not into their mouths, They even prepare war against him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Therefore it shall be night unto you, that ye shall have no vision; And it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; And the sun shall go down upon the prophets, And the day shall be black over them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the seers shall be put to shame, and the diviners confounded; Yea, they shall all cover their upper lips; For there shall be no answer of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But I truly am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, And of justice, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, And to Israel his sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, And rulers of the house of Israel, That abhor justice, and pervert all equity;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">That build up Zion with blood, And Jerusalem with iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The heads thereof judge for reward, And the priests thereof teach for hire, And the prophets thereof divine for money; Yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say: ‘Is not the LORD in the midst of us? No evil shall come upon us’?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, And Jerusalem shall become heaps, And the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.</p>
