  <verse number="1">Nebuchadnezzar the king to all peoples, nations and tongues, that dwell in all the earth, your peace shall become great.</verse>
  <verse number="2">The signs and wonders that the most high God made with me, it was pleasant before me to show.</verse>
  <verse number="3">His signs, how many! and his wonders, how mighty! his kingdom, an eternal kingdom, and his dominion with generation and generation.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I Nebuchadnezzar, was secure in my house, and green in my temple:</verse>
  <verse number="5">I saw a dream, and it will terrify me; and the conceptions upon my bed and the visions of my head, will cause me to tremble.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And an edict being set from me to bring up before me to all the wise of Babel, that they shall make known to me the interpretation of the dream.</verse>
  <verse number="7">At that time the sacred scribes, the enchanters, the Chaldeans, and the diviners, coming in: and I told the dream before them: and its interpretation they making not known to me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And even at last Daniel came up before me, whose name Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, and the spirit of the holy gods in him: and before him I told the dream:</verse>
  <verse number="9">O Belteshazzar, leader of the sacred scribes, for I knew that the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and my secret pressed not upon thee; the visions of my dream that I saw, and its interpretation, say thou.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the visions of my head upon my bed; I was seeing, and lo, a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height great.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the tree increased and was strong, and its height will reach to the heavens, and its sight to the end of all the earth:</verse>
  <verse number="12">Its foliage beautiful, and its fruit great, and food for all in it: and the beasts of the open field will be shaded under it, the buds of the heavens will dwell in its boughs, and all flesh will be nourished from it.</verse>
  <verse number="13">I was seeing in the visions of my head upon my bed, and lo, a watcher and holy one came down from the heavens;</verse>
  <verse number="14">He called with strength, and thus he said, Hew down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its foliage and scatter its fruit: the beasts shall flee from under it, and the birds from its branches.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the open field; and in the dew of the heavens it shall be wet, and its portion with the beasts in the green herb of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Its heart shall be changed from man, and the heart of a beast shall be given to it; and seven times shall pass over him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The word by the decree of the watchers, and the saying of the holy ones is the question: for the reason that the living shall know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and to whom that he will, he will give it, and he will raise up over it the low of men.</verse>
  <verse number="18">This dream, I king Nebuchadnezzar saw. And thou Belteshazzar, tell the interpretation, because that all the wise of my kingdom not being able to make known to me the interpretation: and thou art able, for the spirit of the holy gods is in thee.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Then Daniel, his name Belteshazzar, was astonished for one moment, and his thoughts terrified him. The king answered and said, Belteshazzar, the dream and its interpretation shall not terrify thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream to those hating thee, and its interpretation to thine enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The tree that thou sawest that increased and was strong, and its height will reach to the heavens, and its sight to all the earth,</verse>
  <verse number="21">And its foliage beautiful, and its fruit great, and food for all in it; under it the beast of the open field will dwell, and in its branches the birds of the heavens will dwell:</verse>
  <verse number="22">It is thou, O king, who increased and wert strong: and thy greatness increased and reached to the heavens, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And that the king saw a watcher and a holy one came down from the heavens, and said, Hew down the tree and destroy it; but leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and with a band of iron and brass in the tender grass of the open field; and with the dew of the heavens it shall be wet, and with the beasts of the open field its portion, even till seven times shall pass over him;</verse>
  <verse number="24">This the interpretation, O king, and this the decree of the Most High, that came upon my lord the king:</verse>
  <verse number="25">And for thee driving from men, and with the beasts of the open field to be thy dwelling, and they shall feed to thee grass as oxen, and wetting to thee from the dew of the heavens, and seven times shall pass over thee till that thou shalt know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and to whom that he will, he will give it.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And that they said to leave the stump of the roots of the tree; thy kingdom being sure to thee, from when thou shalt know that the heavens rule.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Wherefore, O king, my counsel shall be pleasant to thee, and break off thy sins by justice, and thine iniquities in compassionating the poor; if it shall be a lengthening to thy peace.</verse>
  <verse number="28">All came upon Nebuchadnezzar the king.</verse>
  <verse number="29">At the end of twelve months in the temple of the kingdom of Babel, he was going about.</verse>
  <verse number="30">The king answered and said, Is not this great Babel, that I built it for the house of the kingdom by the strength of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?</verse>
  <verse number="31">Yet the word in the king’s mouth, a voice from the heavens fell to thee, being said, O Nebuchadnezzar the king, the kingdom passed away from thee:</verse>
  <verse number="32">And from men driving thee out, and with beasts of the open field thy dwelling: and they shall feed to thee the grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee till that thou shalt know that the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and to whom he will, he will give it.</verse>
  <verse number="33">In the same moment the word was added upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven out from men, and he shall eat the green herb as oxen, and from the dew of the heavens his body shall be wet till that his hair was increased as eagles, and his nails as birds’.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And at the end of the days, I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes to the heavens, and my knowledge will turn back to me, and I praised to the Most High, and to him living forever, I praised and honored, whose dominion an eternal dominion, and his kingdom with generation and generation.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And all the generations of the earth being reckoned as nothing: and doing according to his station in the army of the heavens, and the generations of the earth: and there is none that shall strike upon his hand, and say to him, What didst thou?</verse>
  <verse number="36">In that time my knowledge will turn back to me: and for the honor of my kingdom, my splendor and my brightness will return to me; and my counselors and my nobles will seek to me: and I was established over my kingdom, and excellent greatness was added to me.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Now I Nebuchadnezzar, praise and exalt and honor to the king of the heavens, that all his works are truth, and his paths judgment: and that they going about in pride, he being able to bring low.</verse>
