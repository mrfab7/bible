<chapter book="Matthew" number="25" translation="Webster Bible Translation" translationID="wbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.</verse>
  <verse number="3">They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</verse>
  <verse number="4">But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</verse>
  <verse number="5">While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the foolish said to the wise, Give us of your oil: for our lamps are gone out.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready, went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But he answered and said, Verily I say to you, I know you not.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour in which the Son of man cometh.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered to them his goods.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and forthwith took his journey.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then he that had received the five talents, went and traded with the same, and gained other five talents.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But he that had received one, went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.</verse>
  <verse number="19">After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he that had received five talents, came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst to me five talents: behold, I have gained besides them five talents more.</verse>
  <verse number="21">His lord said to him, Well done thou good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He also that had received two talents came, and said, Lord, thou deliveredst to me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents besides them.</verse>
  <verse number="23">His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then he who had received the one talent came, and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strewed:</verse>
  <verse number="25">And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast what is thine.</verse>
  <verse number="26">His lord answered and said to him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I have not sown, and gather where I have not strewed:</verse>
  <verse number="27">Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received my own with interest.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him who hath ten talents.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And cast ye the unprofitable servant into utter darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="31">When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then will he sit upon the throne of his glory:</verse>
  <verse number="32">And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:</verse>
  <verse number="33">And he will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Then will the King say to them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</verse>
  <verse number="35">For I was hungry, and ye gave me food: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</verse>
  <verse number="36">Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came to me.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Then will the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</verse>
  <verse number="38">When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?</verse>
  <verse number="39">Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came to thee?</verse>
  <verse number="40">And the king will answer and say to them, Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it to me.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Then will he say also to them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</verse>
  <verse number="42">For I was hungry, and ye gave me no food: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</verse>
  <verse number="43">I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Then will they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee?</verse>
  <verse number="45">Then will he answer them, saying, Verily I say to you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</verse>
