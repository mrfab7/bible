<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The lifting up the word of Jehovah to Israel by the hand of Malachi.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I loved you, said Jehovah. And ye said, In what didst thou love us? Was not Esau brother to Jacob? says Jehovah: and loving Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I hated Esau, and I will set his mountains a desolation, and his inheritance for the jackals of the desert.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For Edom will say, We were broken down, and we will turn back and build the wastes; thus said Jehovah of armies: They shall build and I will pull down; and calling to them, The bound of injustice, and, The people with whom Jehovah was very angry, even to forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, Jehovah will be magnified from above to the bound of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">A son will honor the father, and the servant his lord; and if I a father, where mine honor? and if I their lord, where my fear? said Jehovah of armies to you, O priests despising my name. And ye said, In what did we despise thy name?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Bringing polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye said, In what did we pollute thee? In your saying, The table of Jehovah it was despised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And if ye shall bring near the blind for a sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye shall bring near the lame and the sick, is it not evil? bring A near now to thy governor; will he delight in thee, or lift up thy face? said Jehovah of armies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And now, beseech now, the face of God, and he will be gracious to us: this was from your hand: will he lift up from you the faces? says Jehovah of armies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who also among you and he will shut the doors? and ye shall not make light mine altar gratuitously. Not to me delight in you, said Jehovah of armies, and I will not delight in the gift of your hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For from the rising of the sun and even to its going down, great my name among the nations; and in every place incense being brought to my name, and a clean gift: for great my name among the nations, said Jehovah of armies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And ye profaning it in your saying, The table of Jehovah it being polluted; and its fruit, its food was despised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And ye said, Behold, what a weariness! and ye puffed at it, said Jehovah of armies; and ye brought the spoiled and the lame, and the sick; and ye brought the gift: shall I accept it from your hand? said Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And cursed he deceiving, and there is in his flock a male, and he vowed and sacrificed a corrupt thing to Jehovah: for I am a great king, said Jehovah of armies, and my name terrible among the nations.</p>
