<chapter book="Hosea" number="11" translation="King James Bible" translationID="kjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">When Israel [was] a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="2">[As] they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour [them], because of their own counsels.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt [him].</verse>
  <verse number="8">How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? [how] shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? [how] shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I [am] God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.</verse>
  <verse number="11">They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.</verse>
