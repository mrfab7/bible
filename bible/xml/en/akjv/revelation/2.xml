  <verse number="1">To the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things said he that holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the middle of the seven golden candlesticks;</verse>
  <verse number="2">I know your works, and your labor, and your patience, and how you can not bear them which are evil: and you have tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and have found them liars:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And have borne, and have patience, and for my name’s sake have labored, and have not fainted.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Nevertheless I have somewhat against you, because you have left your first love.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Remember therefore from where you are fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come to you quickly, and will remove your candlestick out of his place, except you repent.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But this you have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the middle of the paradise of God.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things said the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</verse>
  <verse number="9">I know your works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but you are rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Fear none of those things which you shall suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be you faithful to death, and I will give you a crown of life.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; He that overcomes shall not be hurt of the second death.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things said he which has the sharp sword with two edges;</verse>
  <verse number="13">I know your works, and where you dwell, even where Satan’s seat is: and you hold fast my name, and have not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwells.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But I have a few things against you, because you have there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.</verse>
  <verse number="15">So have you also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Repent; or else I will come to you quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches; To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knows saving he that receives it.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things said the Son of God, who has his eyes like to a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;</verse>
  <verse number="19">I know your works, and charity, and service, and faith, and your patience, and your works; and the last to be more than the first.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Notwithstanding I have a few things against you, because you suffer that woman Jezebel, which calls herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the reins and hearts: and I will give to every one of you according to your works.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But to you I say, and to the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put on you none other burden.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But that which you have already hold fast till I come.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And he that overcomes, and keeps my works to the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And I will give him the morning star.</verse>
  <verse number="29">He that has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit said to the churches.</verse>
