<chapter book="Galatians" number="3" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">O Unwise Galatians, who has cast a spell upon you, not to obey the truth, to whom before the eyes Jesus Christ was written beforehand, crucified in you?</verse>
  <verse number="2">This only wish I to learn from you, Received ye the Spirit from the works of the law, or from the hearing of faith?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Are ye so unwise? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now completed in the flesh?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Suffered ye so many things in vain? if yet also in vain.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He therefore furnishing you the Spirit, and working the powers in you, is it from the works of the law, or from the hearing of faith?</verse>
  <verse number="6">As Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for justice.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Know ye therefore that they of faith, these are sons of Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the writing, foreseeing that of faith God justifies the nations, announced beforehand the good news to Abraham, That in thee shall all nations be praised.</verse>
  <verse number="9">So that they of faith are praised with faithful Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it has been written, Cursed every one who remains not in all written in the book of the law to do them.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And that none is justified in the law before God, is manifest: for, The just shall live of faith.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the law is not of faith: but, The man having done them shall live in them.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having been a curse for us: for it has been written, Cursed every one hanging upon a tree:</verse>
  <verse number="14">That the praise of Abraham might be to the nations in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Brethren, I speak according to man; Although a man’s covenant, having been confirmed, none annuls, or orders an addition.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He says not, And to seeds, as to many; but as to one: And to thy seed, who is Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And I say this, the covenant confirmed before by God in Christ, the law, having been after four hundred and thirty years, does not annul, to neglect the promise.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For if of the law the inheritance, no more of promise: and God has favored Abraham by promise.</verse>
  <verse number="19">What then the law? It was added on account of transgressions, (till the seed come to whom it was promised;) appointed by angels in the hand of a mediator.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And a mediator is not of one, and God is one.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The law then against the promises of God? It may not be: for if a law had been given able to make alive, truly justice would be by the law.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But the writing shut up all things under sin, that the promise from faith of Jesus Christ might be given to the believing.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And before faith came, we were guarded under the law, shut up to faith about to be revealed.</verse>
  <verse number="24">So that the law was our preceptor towards Christ, that we might be justified from faith.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And faith having come, we are no more under a preceptor.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For we are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For as many of you as were immersed into Christ have put on Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="28">There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither servant nor free, there is neither male and female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And if ye of Christ, then are ye Abraham’s seed, and heirs according to the promise.</verse>
