<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Be not thou envious of evil men, neither desire to be with them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">for their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Through wisdom is a house built, and by understanding it is established;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and by knowledge are the chambers filled with all precious and pleasant substance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A wise man is strong, and a man of knowledge increaseth strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For with good advice shalt thou make thy war; and in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wisdom is too high for a fool: he will not open his mouth in the gate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a master of intrigues.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The purpose of folly is sin, and the scorner is an abomination to men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">[If] thou losest courage in the day of trouble, thy strength is small.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Deliver them that are taken forth unto death, and withdraw not from them that stagger to slaughter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not, will not he that weigheth the hearts consider it? And he that preserveth thy soul, he knoweth it; and he rendereth to man according to his work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Eat honey, my son, for it is good; and a honeycomb is sweet to thy taste:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">so consider wisdom for thy soul; if thou hast found it, there shall be a result, and thine expectation shall not be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Lay not wait, O wicked [man], against the dwelling of the righteous; lay not waste his resting-place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For the righteous falleth seven times, and riseth up again; but the wicked stumble into disaster.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thy heart be glad when he stumbleth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">lest Jehovah see it, and it be evil in his sight, and he turn away his anger from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, [and] be not envious of the wicked:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">for there shall be no future to the evil [man]; the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">My son, fear Jehovah and the king: meddle not with them that are given to change.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">These things also come from the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous, peoples shall curse him, nations shall abhor him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">but to them that rebuke [him] shall be delight, and a good blessing cometh upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He kisseth the lips who giveth a right answer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Prepare thy work without, and put thy field in order, and afterwards build thy house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and wouldest thou deceive with thy lips?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me, I will render to the man according to his work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">I went by the field of a sluggard, and by the vineyard of a man void of understanding;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">and lo, it was all grown over with thistles, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and its stone wall was broken down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Then I looked, I took it to heart; I saw, I received instruction:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">â€”A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">So shall thy poverty come [as] a roving plunderer, and thy penury as an armed man.</p>
