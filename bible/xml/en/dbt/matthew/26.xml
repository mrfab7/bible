  <verse number="1">And it came to pass when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Ye know that after two days the passover takes place, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together to the palace of the high priest who was called Caiaphas,</verse>
  <verse number="4">and took counsel together in order that they might seize Jesus by subtlety and kill him;</verse>
  <verse number="5">but they said, Not in the feast, that there be not a tumult among the people.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But Jesus being in Bethany, in Simon the leper’s house,</verse>
  <verse number="7">a woman, having an alabaster flask of very precious ointment, came to him and poured it out upon his head as he lay at table.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But the disciples seeing it became indignant, saying, To what end [was] this waste?</verse>
  <verse number="9">for this might have been sold for much and been given to the poor.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But Jesus knowing [it] said to them, Why do ye trouble the woman? for she has wrought a good work toward me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For in pouring out this ointment on my body, she has done it for my burying.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Verily I say to you, Wheresoever these glad tidings may be preached in the whole world, that also which this [woman] has done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then one of the twelve, he who was called Judas Iscariote, went to the chief priests</verse>
  <verse number="15">and said, What are ye willing to give me, and I will deliver him up to you? And they appointed to him thirty pieces of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And from that time he sought a good opportunity that he might deliver him up.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Now on the first [day] of [the feast of] unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he said, Go into the city unto such a one, and say to him, The Teacher says, My time is near, I will keep the passover in thy house with my disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the passover.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And when the evening was come he lay down at table with the twelve.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And as they were eating he said, Verily I say to you, that one of you shall deliver me up.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And being exceedingly grieved they began to say to him, each of them, Is it I, Lord?</verse>
  <verse number="23">But he answering said, He that dips his hand with me in the dish, he it is who shall deliver me up.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The Son of man goes indeed, according as it is written concerning him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is delivered up; it were good for that man if he had not been born.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And Judas, who delivered him up, answering said, Is it I, Rabbi? He says to him, Thou hast said.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And as they were eating, Jesus, having taken [the] bread and blessed, broke [it] and gave [it] to the disciples, and said, Take, eat: this is my body.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And having taken [the] cup and given thanks, he gave [it] to them, saying, Drink ye all of it.</verse>
  <verse number="28">For this is my blood, that of the [new] covenant, that shed for many for remission of sins.</verse>
  <verse number="29">But I say to you, that I will not at all drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And having sung a hymn, they went out to the mount of Olives.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Then saith Jesus to them, All ye shall be offended in me during this night. For it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But after that I shall be risen, I will go before you to Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And Peter answering said to him, If all shall be offended in thee, I will never be offended.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, that during this night, before [the] cock shall crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Peter says to him, If I should needs die with thee, I will in no wise deny thee. Likewise said all the disciples also.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane, and says to the disciples, Sit here until I go away and pray yonder.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And taking with [him] Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and deeply depressed.</verse>
  <verse number="38">Then he says to them, My soul is very sorrowful even unto death; remain here and watch with me.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And going forward a little he fell upon his face, praying and saying, My Father, if it be possible let this cup pass from me; but not as I will, but as thou [wilt].</verse>
  <verse number="40">And he comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping, and says to Peter, Thus ye have not been able to watch one hour with me?</verse>
  <verse number="41">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed [is] ready, but the flesh weak.</verse>
  <verse number="42">Again going away a second time he prayed saying, My Father, if this cannot pass [from me] unless I drink it, thy will be done.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And coming he found them again sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And leaving them, he went away again and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Then he comes to the disciples and says to them, Sleep on now and take your rest; behold, the hour has drawn nigh, and the Son of man is delivered up into the hands of sinners.</verse>
  <verse number="46">Arise, let us go; behold, he that delivers me up has drawn nigh.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And while he was yet speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great crowd with swords and sticks from the chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
  <verse number="48">Now he that delivered him up had given them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, he it is: seize him.</verse>
  <verse number="49">And immediately coming up to Jesus he said, Hail, Rabbi, and covered him with kisses.</verse>
  <verse number="50">But Jesus said to him, [My] friend, for what purpose art thou come? Then coming up they laid hands upon Jesus and seized him.</verse>
  <verse number="51">And behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and smiting the bondman of the high priest took off his ear.</verse>
  <verse number="52">Then saith Jesus to him, Return thy sword to its place; for all who take the sword shall perish by the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="53">Or thinkest thou that I cannot now call upon my Father, and he will furnish me more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
  <verse number="54">How then should the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?</verse>
  <verse number="55">In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, Are ye come out as against a robber with swords and sticks to take me? I sat daily [with you] teaching in the temple, and ye did not seize me.</verse>
  <verse number="56">But all this is come to pass that the scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled.</verse>
  <verse number="57">Now they that had seized Jesus led [him] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</verse>
  <verse number="58">And Peter followed him at a distance, even to the palace of the high priest, and entering in sat with the officers to see the end.</verse>
  <verse number="59">And the chief priests and the elders and the whole sanhedrim sought false witness against Jesus, so that they might put him to death.</verse>
  <verse number="60">And they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. But at the last two false witnesses came forward</verse>
  <verse number="61">and said, He said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and in three days build it.</verse>
  <verse number="62">And the high priest standing up said to him, Answerest thou nothing? What do these witness against thee?</verse>
  <verse number="63">But Jesus was silent. And the high priest answering said to him, I adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us if thou art the Christ the Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="64">Jesus says to him, Thou hast said. Moreover, I say to you, From henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="65">Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He has blasphemed: what need have we any more of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard the blasphemy.</verse>
  <verse number="66">What think ye? And they answering said, He is liable to the penalty of death.</verse>
  <verse number="67">Then they spit in his face, and buffeted him, and some struck him with the palms of their hand,</verse>
  <verse number="68">saying, Prophesy to us, Christ, Who is it who struck thee?</verse>
  <verse number="69">But Peter sat without in the palace-court; and a maid came to him, saying, And thou wast with Jesus the Galilaean.</verse>
  <verse number="70">But he denied before all, saying, I do not know what thou sayest.</verse>
  <verse number="71">And when he had gone out into the entrance, another [maid] saw him, and says to those there, This [man] also was with Jesus the Nazaraean.</verse>
  <verse number="72">And again he denied with an oath: I do not know the man.</verse>
  <verse number="73">And after a little, those who stood [there], coming to [him], said to Peter, Truly thou too art of them, for also thy speech makes thee manifest.</verse>
  <verse number="74">Then he began to curse and to swear, I know not the man. And immediately [the] cock crew.</verse>
  <verse number="75">And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who had said [to him], Before [the] cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went forth without, and wept bitterly.</verse>
