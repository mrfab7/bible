<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Shake thyself from the dust; arise, [and] sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought; and ye shall be redeemed without money.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them without cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every day [is] blasphemed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore [they shall know] in that day that I [am] he that doth speak: behold, [it is] I.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD shall bring again Zion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of our God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean [thing]; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel [will be] your rereward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him: for [that] which had not been told them shall they see; and [that] which they had not heard shall they consider.</p>
