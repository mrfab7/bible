<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After these was the festival of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And there is in Jerusalem, at the sheep place a pool, in Hebrew called Bethesda, having five porches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">In these lay a great multitude of weak, blind, lame, withered, expecting the moving of the water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For a messenger at a time went down into the pool, and troubled the water: then he having first stepped in after the troubling of the water became healthy, by whatever malady a long while since he was laid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And a certain man was there, being in weakness thirty-eight years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Jesus having seen the same lying down, and having known that it was already much time, says to him, Wilt thou be well?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He being sick answered him, Lord, I have no man, that, when the water was troubled, he might cast me into the pool: and in which I am coming, another steps down before me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Jesus says to him, Arise, take up thy couch, and walk.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And quickly the man was well, and he took up his couch, and walked: and the sabbath was in that day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then said the Jews to him healed, It is the sabbath: it is not lawful for thee to take up thy couch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He answered them, He having made me well, the same said to me, Lift up thy couch, and walk.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Then they asked him, Who is the man having said to thee, Lift up thy couch, and walk?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And he healed knew not who he is: for Jesus escaped, a crowd being in the place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">After these, Jesus finds him in the temple, and he said to him, Behold, thou hast become well: sin no more, lest something worse be to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The man departed, and announced to the Jews that it is Jesus having made him well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And therefore the Jews drove out Jesus, and sought to kill him, because he did these in the sabbath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Jesus answered, My Father works till now, and I work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For this therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, for not only did he loose the sabbath, but also he called God his own Father, making himself equal to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can of himself do nothing, except what he sees the Father doing: for whatever he should do, also these does the Son likewise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all which himself does: and he will show him greater than these, that ye might wonder.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For as the Father arouses the dead, and makes alive; so also the Son makes alive whom he will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For the Father judges no one, but he has given all judgment to the Son:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">That all should honour the Son, as they honour the Father. He honouring not the Son, honours not the Father having sent him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Truly, truly, I say to you, That he hearing my word, and believing him having sent me, has eternal life, and comes not into judgment; but has passed from death to life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Truly, truly, I say to you, That the hour comes, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they hearing shall live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For as the Father has life in himself, so also gave he to the Son to have life in himself;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And gave him authority also to do judgment, because he is the Son of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Wonder not at this: for the hour comes, in which all they in the tombs shall hear his voice, and shall go forth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">They having done good, to rising up of life; and they having done bad, to rising up of judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">I can do nothing of myself: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; for I seek not my will, but the will of the Father having sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">If I testify of myself, my testimony is not true.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Another is testifying of me, and I know that the testimony which he testifies of me is true.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Ye have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">But I receive not testimony from man: but these I say that ye might be saved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">He was a burning and manifest light: and ye wished to rejoice for a time in his light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And I have greater testimony than of John: for the works that the Father gave me that I might finish them, the same works that I do, testify of me, that the Father has sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And the Father having sent me, he has testified of me. Nor have ye at any time heard his voice, or seen his form.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And his word ye have not remaining in you: for whom he sent, him ye believe not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Search the writings; for ye think in them to have eternal life: and these are they testifying of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And ye wish not to come to me, that ye might have life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">I receive not glory from man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">I have come in the name of my Father, and ye receive me not: if another should come in his own name, him will ye receive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">How can ye believe, receiving glory from one another, and ye seek not the glory that from God alone?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Think not that I shall accuse you to the Father: he accusing you is Moses, in whom ye have hoped.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">For if ye had believed Moses, ye had believed me: for he himself wrote of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">And if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</p>
