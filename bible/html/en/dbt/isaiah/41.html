<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Keep silence before me, islands; and let the peoples renew [their] strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us draw near together to judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Who raised up from the east him whom righteousness calleth to its foot? He gave the nations before him, and caused him to have dominion over kings; he gave them as dust to his sword, as driven stubble to his bow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He pursued them, he passed on in safety, by a way he had never come with his feet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who hath wrought and done [it], calling the generations from the beginning? I, Jehovah, the first; and with the last, I [am] HE.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The isles saw [it], and feared; the ends of the earth trembled: they drew near, and came.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">They helped every one his neighbour, and [each] said to his brother, Take courage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the artizan encouraged the founder, he that smootheth [with] the hammer him that smiteth on the anvil, saying of the soldering, It is good; and he fasteneth it with nails, that it be not moved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But thou, Israel, my servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham, my friend</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">—thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called from the extremities thereof, and to whom I said, Thou art my servant, I have chosen thee and not rejected thee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">—Fear not, for I [am] with thee; be not dismayed, for I [am] thy God: I will strengthen thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Lo, all that are incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded; they that strive with thee shall be as nothing, and shall perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them—them that contend with thee; they that war against thee shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For I, Jehovah, thy God, hold thy right hand, saying unto thee, Fear not; I will help thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Fear not, thou worm Jacob, ye men of Israel; I will help thee, saith Jehovah, and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold, I have made of thee a new sharp threshing instrument having double teeth: thou shalt thresh and beat small the mountains, and shalt make the hills as chaff;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them; and thou shalt rejoice in Jehovah, thou shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The afflicted and the needy seek water, and there is none; their tongue faileth for thirst: I, Jehovah, will answer them, [I], the God of Israel, will not forsake them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I will open rivers on the bare heights, and fountains in the midst of the valleys; I will make the wilderness into a pool of water, and the dry land into water-springs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I will give in the wilderness the cedar, acacia, myrtle, and oleaster; I will set in the desert the cypress, pine, and box-tree together;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of Jehovah hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Produce your cause, saith Jehovah; bring forward your arguments, saith the King of Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Let them bring them forward, and declare to us what shall happen: shew the former things, what they are, that we may give attention to them, and know the end of them;—or let us hear things to come:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">declare the things that are to happen hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods; yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be astonished, and behold it together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Behold, ye are less than nothing, and your work is of nought; an abomination is he that chooseth you....</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come,—from the rising of the sun, he who will call upon my name; and he shall come upon princes as on mortar, and as the potter treadeth clay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Who hath declared [it] from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, [It is] right? Indeed, there is none that declareth; no, none that sheweth; no, none that heareth your words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The first, [I said] to Zion, Behold, behold them! and to Jerusalem, I will give one that bringeth glad tidings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And I beheld, and there was no man; even among them,—and there was no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Behold, they are all vanity, their works are nought, their molten images are wind and emptiness.</p>
