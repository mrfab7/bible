  <verse number="1">After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Job answered and said:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night which said, There is a man child conceived.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own; let a cloud dwell upon it; let all that maketh black the day terrify it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it: let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Lo, let that night be barren; let no joyful voice come therein.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark: let it look for light, but have none; neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Because it shut not up the doors of my mother’s womb, nor hid trouble from mine eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Why did the knees receive me? or why the breasts, that I should suck?</verse>
  <verse number="13">For now should I have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept; then had I been at rest:</verse>
  <verse number="14">With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built up waste places for themselves;</verse>
  <verse number="15">Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</verse>
  <verse number="16">Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.</verse>
  <verse number="17">There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</verse>
  <verse number="18">There the prisoners are at ease together; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;</verse>
  <verse number="21">Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</verse>
  <verse number="22">Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</verse>
  <verse number="24">For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like water.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For the thing which I fear cometh upon me, and that which I am afraid of cometh unto me.</verse>
  <verse number="26">I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; but trouble cometh.</verse>
