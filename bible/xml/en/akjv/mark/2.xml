  <verse number="1">And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was noised that he was in the house.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And straightway many were gathered together, so that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he preached the word to them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And they come to him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And when they could not come near to him for the press, they uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.</verse>
  <verse number="5">When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the sick of the palsy, Son, your sins be forgiven you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But there was certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</verse>
  <verse number="7">Why does this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins but God only?</verse>
  <verse number="8">And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, he said to them, Why reason you these things in your hearts?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Your sins be forgiven you; or to say, Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?</verse>
  <verse number="10">But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (he said to the sick of the palsy,)</verse>
  <verse number="11">I say to you, Arise, and take up your bed, and go your way into your house.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it on this fashion.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude resorted to him, and he taught them.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom, and said to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said to his disciples, How is it that he eats and drinks with publicans and sinners?</verse>
  <verse number="17">When Jesus heard it, he said to them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples fast not?</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the bridal chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</verse>
  <verse number="21">No man also sews a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else the new piece that filled it up takes away from the old, and the rent is made worse.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And no man puts new wine into old bottles: else the new wine does burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he said to them, Have you never read what David did, when he had need, and was an hungered, he, and they that were with him?</verse>
  <verse number="26">How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and did eat the show bread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he said to them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath:</verse>
  <verse number="28">Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</verse>
