1	Now it happened in the day when Moses completed the tabernacle, and he set it up, and he anointed and sanctified it with all of its vessels, and similarly the altar and all of its vessels,
2	that the leaders of Israel and the heads of the families, who were in each tribe and who were in charge of those who had been numbered, offered
3	their gifts in the sight of the Lord: six covered wagons with twelve oxen. Two leaders offered one wagon, and each offered one ox, and they offered these in the sight of the tabernacle.
4	Then the Lord said to Moses:
5	“Receive these things from them, in order to serve in the ministry of the tabernacle, and you shall deliver them to the Levites, according to the order of their ministry.”
6	And so Moses, having received the wagons and the oxen, delivered them to the Levites.
7	Two wagons and four oxen he gave to the sons of Gershon, according to what they needed.
8	The other four wagons and eight oxen he gave to the sons of Merari, according to their offices and service, under the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.
9	But to the sons of Kohath he gave no wagons or oxen, because they serve in the Sanctuary and they carry their burdens on their shoulders.
10	Therefore, the leaders offered, at the dedication of the altar on the day when it was anointed, their oblation before the altar.
11	And the Lord said to Moses: “Let each of the leaders, on each of the days, offer their gifts for the dedication of the altar.”

16	and a he-goat for sin;
