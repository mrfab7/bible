  <verse number="3">She hath sent forth her maidens, she crieth upon the highest places of the city,</verse>

  <verse number="6">Leave off, ye simple ones, and live; and walk in the way of understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He that correcteth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that reproveth a wicked man getteth himself a blot.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: reprove a wise man, and he will love thee.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.</verse>
