<chapter book="John" number="4" translation="Webster Bible Translation" translationID="wbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</verse>
  <verse number="2">(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</verse>
  <verse number="3">He left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he must needs go through Samaria.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then he cometh to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground, that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.</verse>
  <verse number="7">There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith to her, Give me to drink.</verse>
  <verse number="8">(For his disciples had gone to the city to buy provisions.)</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then saith the woman of Samaria to him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Jesus answered and said to her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldst have asked him, and he would have given thee living water.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The woman saith to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his children, and his cattle?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Jesus answered and said to her, Whoever drinketh of this water, shall thirst again:</verse>
  <verse number="14">But whoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him, shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The woman saith to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, neither come hither to draw.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Jesus saith to her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</verse>
  <verse number="18">For thou hast had five husbands, and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband: in that thou hast spoken truth.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The woman saith to him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Our fathers worshiped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Jesus saith to her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship, for salvation is from the Jews.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</verse>
  <verse number="24">God is a Spirit: and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and in truth.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The woman saith to him, I know that Messiah cometh, who is called Christ; when he is come, he will tell us all things.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Jesus saith to her, I that speak to thee am he.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And upon this came his disciples, and marveled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?</verse>
  <verse number="28">The woman then left her waterpot, and went into the city, and saith to the men,</verse>
  <verse number="29">Come, see a man who hath told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</verse>
  <verse number="30">Then they went out of the city, and came to him.</verse>
  <verse number="31">In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But he said to them, I have food to eat that ye know not of.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him aught to eat?</verse>
  <verse number="34">Jesus saith to them, My food is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit to life eternal: that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, may rejoice together.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</verse>
  <verse number="38">I sent you to reap that on which ye bestowed no labor: other men labored, and ye have entered into their labors.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, who testified, He told me all that ever I did.</verse>
  <verse number="40">So when the Samaritans had come to him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And many more believed, because of his own word;</verse>
  <verse number="42">And said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="44">For Jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Then when he had come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went to the feast.</verse>
  <verse number="46">So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</verse>
  <verse number="47">When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into Galilee, he went to him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</verse>
  <verse number="48">Then said Jesus to him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</verse>
  <verse number="49">The nobleman saith to him, Sir, come down ere my child dieth.</verse>
  <verse number="50">Jesus saith to him, Go; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken to him, and he departed.</verse>
  <verse number="51">And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.</verse>
  <verse number="52">Then he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend: and they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</verse>
  <verse number="53">So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth: and he himself believed, and his whole house.</verse>
  <verse number="54">This is again the second miracle that Jesus performed, when he had come from Judea into Galilee.</verse>
