<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="5" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one of you hath his fatherâ€™s wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already as though I were present judged him that hath so wrought this thing,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been sacrificed, even Christ:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">not at all meaning with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">but as it is, I wrote unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But them that are without God judgeth. Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.</p>
