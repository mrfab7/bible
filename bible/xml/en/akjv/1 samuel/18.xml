<chapter book="1 Samuel" number="18" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking to Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father’s house.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him, and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And David went out wherever Saul sent him, and behaved himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul’s servants.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul, with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of music.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the women answered one another as they played, and said, Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he said, They have ascribed to David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more but the kingdom?</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from God came on Saul, and he prophesied in the middle of the house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and there was a javelin in Saul’s hand.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, and was departed from Saul.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD was with him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Why when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he was afraid of him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and came in before them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her will I give you to wife: only be you valiant for me, and fight the LORD’s battles. For Saul said, Let not my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And David said to Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the king?</verse>
  <verse number="19">But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul’s daughter should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel the Meholathite to wife.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Michal Saul’s daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Why Saul said to David, You shall this day be my son in law in the one of the two.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David secretly, and say, Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his servants love you: now therefore be the king’s son in law.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Saul’s servants spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, Seems it to you a light thing to be a king’s son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spoke David.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And Saul said, Thus shall you say to David, The king desires not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies. But Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son in law: and the days were not expired.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Why David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that he might be the king’s son in law. And Saul gave him Michal his daughter to wife.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal Saul’s daughter loved him.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David’s enemy continually.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was much set by.</verse>
