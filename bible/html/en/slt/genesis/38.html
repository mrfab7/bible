<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And it shall be in that time, and Judah will go down from his brethren, and will turn to a man, an Adullamite, and his name Hirah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Judah will see there the daughter of a man, a Canaanite, and his name Shuah, and he will take her and will go in to her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And she will conceive and bring forth a son, and he will call his name Er.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And she will conceive yet again and bear a son, and will call his name Onan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And she will add yet and bear a son, and will call his name Shelah: and he was in Chezib, in her bearing him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Judah will take a wife for Er his first-born, and her name Tamar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And Er, Judah’s first-born, will be evil in the eyes of Jehovah: and Jehovah will kill him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Judah will say to Onan, go in to thy brother’s wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Onan will know that not to him will be the seed; and it was when he went in to his brother’s wife, he destroyed upon the earth, not to give seed to his brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And it will be evil in the eyes of Jehovah, what he did, and he will kill him also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Judah will say to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Sit a widow in thy father’s house, till Shelah my son shall be great; (for he said, Lest this also shall die as his brethren.) And Tamar will go and will sit in her father’s house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the days will be multiplied, and the daughter of Shuah, Judah’s wife, will die; and Judah will be comforted, and will go up to the shearers of his sheep, he and Hirah his friend the Adullamite, to Timnath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And it will be announced to Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law going up to Timnath to shear his sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And she will remove the garments of her widowhood from her, and she will be covered with a veil, and will veil herself and will sit in the entrance of the eyes, which is upon the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was great, and she was not given to him for a wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Judah will see her, and will think her a harlot, because she covered her face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he will turn to her by the way, and will say, Now I will come in to thee; for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law: and she will say, What wilt thou give to me that thou wilt come in to me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he will say, I will send a kid of the goats from the flock: and she will say, If thou wilt give a pledge till thy sending.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he will say, What the pledge which I shall give to thee? And she will say, Thy seal, and thy cord, and thy rod which is in thy hand: and he will give to her, and will go in to her, and she will conceive by him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And she will arise and go, and will put away her veil from her, and will put on the garments of her widowhood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Judah will send the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to take the pledge from the hand of the woman; and he found her not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And he will ask the men of the place, saying, Where the harlot, she in the eyes upon the way? and they will say, No harlot was here.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And he will turn back to Judah, and will say, I found her not; and also the men of the place said, No harlot was here.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Judah will say, She shall take to her, lest we shall be for a contempt: Behold, I sent this kid, and thou didst not find her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And it will be after three months, and it will be announced to Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law committed fornication; and also, behold, she conceived by fornication. And Judah will say, Bring her forth, and she shall be burnt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">She being brought forth, and she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man whose are these, by him I conceived. And she will say, Recognise, now, to whom the seal, the cords, and the rod, these.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And Judah will recognise, and will say, She was justified more than I, because that I gave her not to Shelah my son: and he will not add to know her yet again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And it will be in the time of her bringing forth, and behold, twins in her womb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And it will be in her bringing forth, and he will give the hand; and the midwife will take and bind upon his hand, scarlet, saying, This came forth first.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And it will be after turning back his hand, and behold his brother will come forth; and she will say, How didst thou break forth? the breach upon thee: and his name shall be called.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And afterward his brother will come forth, whom upon his hand the scarlet, and his name shall be called Zarah.</p>
