<chapter book="Isaiah" number="6" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Above him stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings. With two he covered his face. With two he covered his feet. With two he flew.</verse>
  <verse number="3">One called to another, and said, “Holy, holy, holy, is Yahweh of Armies! The whole earth is full of his glory!”</verse>
  <verse number="4">The foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then I said, “Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of Armies!”</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He touched my mouth with it, and said, “Behold, this has touched your lips; and your iniquity is taken away, and your sin forgiven.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">I heard the Lord’s voice, saying, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” Then I said, “Here I am. Send me!”</verse>
  <verse number="9">He said, “Go, and tell this people, ‘You hear indeed, but don’t understand; and you see indeed, but don’t perceive.’</verse>
  <verse number="10">Make the heart of this people fat. Make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.”</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then I said, “Lord, how long?” He answered, “Until cities are waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land becomes utterly waste,</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Yahweh has removed men far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If there is a tenth left in it, that also will in turn be consumed: as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remains when they are felled; so the holy seed is its stock.”</verse>
