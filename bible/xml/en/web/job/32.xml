<chapter book="Job" number="32" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled against Job. His wrath was kindled because he justified himself rather than God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Also his wrath was kindled against his three friends, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job, because they were elder than he.</verse>
  <verse number="5">When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered, “I am young, and you are very old; Therefore I held back, and didn’t dare show you my opinion.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I said, ‘Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.’</verse>
  <verse number="8">But there is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty gives them understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="9">It is not the great who are wise, nor the aged who understand justice.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore I said, ‘Listen to me; I also will show my opinion.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">“Behold, I waited for your words, and I listened for your reasoning, while you searched out what to say.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Yes, I gave you my full attention, but there was no one who convinced Job, or who answered his words, among you.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Beware lest you say, ‘We have found wisdom, God may refute him, not man;’</verse>
  <verse number="14">for he has not directed his words against me; neither will I answer him with your speeches.</verse>
  <verse number="15">“They are amazed. They answer no more. They don’t have a word to say.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Shall I wait, because they don’t speak, because they stand still, and answer no more?</verse>
  <verse number="17">I also will answer my part, and I also will show my opinion.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For I am full of words. The spirit within me constrains me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Behold, my breast is as wine which has no vent; like new wineskins it is ready to burst.</verse>
  <verse number="20">I will speak, that I may be refreshed. I will open my lips and answer.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Please don’t let me respect any man’s person, neither will I give flattering titles to any man.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For I don’t know how to give flattering titles; or else my Maker would soon take me away.</verse>
