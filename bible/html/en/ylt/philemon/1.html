<div class="chapter" data-book="Philemon" data-chapter="1" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timotheus the brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and Apphia the beloved, and Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the assembly in thy house:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I give thanks to my God, always making mention of thee in my prayers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">hearing of thy love and faith that thou hast unto the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">that the fellowship of thy faith may become working in the full knowledge of every good thing that is in you toward Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">for we have much joy and comfort in thy love, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Wherefore, having in Christ much boldness to command thee that which is fit—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">because of the love I rather entreat, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I entreat thee concerning my child—whom I did beget in my bonds—Onesimus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">who once was to thee unprofitable, and now is profitable to me and to thee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">whom I did send again, and thou him (that is, my own bowels) receive,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">whom I did wish to retain to myself, that in thy behalf he might minister to me in the bonds of the good news,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and apart from thy mind I willed to do nothing, that as of necessity thy good deed may not be, but of willingness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">for perhaps because of this he did depart for an hour, that age-duringly thou mayest have him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">no more as a servant, but above a servant—a brother beloved, especially to me, and how much more to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If, then, with me thou hast fellowship, receive him as me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">and if he did hurt to thee, or doth owe anything, this to me be reckoning;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I, Paul did write with my hand, I—I will repay; that I may not say that also thyself, besides, to me thou dost owe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Yes, brother, may I have profit of thee in the Lord; refresh my bowels in the Lord;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">having been confident in thy obedience I did write to thee, having known that also above what I may say thou wilt do;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">and at the same time also prepare for me a lodging, for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Salute thee doth Epaphras, (my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus,)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Markus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lukas, my fellow-workmen!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with your spirit! Amen.</p>
