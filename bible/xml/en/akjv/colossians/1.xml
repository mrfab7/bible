  <verse number="1">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,</verse>
  <verse number="2">To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="3">We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints,</verse>
  <verse number="5">For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof you heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;</verse>
  <verse number="6">Which is come to you, as it is in all the world; and brings forth fruit, as it does also in you, since the day you heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:</verse>
  <verse number="7">As you also learned of Epaphras our dear fellow servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="8">Who also declared to us your love in the Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;</verse>
  <verse number="10">That you might walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;</verse>
  <verse number="11">Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, to all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness;</verse>
  <verse number="12">Giving thanks to the Father, which has made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:</verse>
  <verse number="14">In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:</verse>
  <verse number="15">Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:</verse>
  <verse number="16">For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell;</verse>
  <verse number="20">And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now has he reconciled</verse>
  <verse number="22">In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:</verse>
  <verse number="23">If you continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which you have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;</verse>
  <verse number="24">Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body’s sake, which is the church:</verse>
  <verse number="25">Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfill the word of God;</verse>
  <verse number="26">Even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:</verse>
  <verse number="27">To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:</verse>
  <verse number="28">Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:</verse>
  <verse number="29">Whereunto I also labor, striving according to his working, which works in me mightily.</verse>
