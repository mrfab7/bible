<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Abram shall be the son of ninety years and nine years: Jehovah shall be seen to Abram and will say to him, I am God Almighty; walk thou before me, and be complete.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And I will give my covenant between me and between thee, and I will multiply thee with might exceedingly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Abram will fall upon his face, and God will speak to him, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I, behold my covenant with thee, thou being father of a multitude of nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And thy name shall no more be called Abram, and thy name shall be Abraham, for the father of a multitude of nations have I given thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And I made thee fruitful with might exceedingly, and I gave thee for nations, and kings shall come forth from thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I set up my covenant between me and between thee, and between thy seed after thee to their generations for a covenant of eternity; to be a God to thee and to thy seed after thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And I gave to thee and to thy seed after thee, the land of thy sojournings with all the land of Canaan for an eternal possession; and I was God to them.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And the uncircumcised male which shall not be circumcised in the flesh of his uncircumcision, and that soul shall be cut off from its people: he broke my covenant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And God will say to Abraham, Sarai, thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, for Sarah her name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And I blessed her, and I gave thee also a son of her: and I blessed her and she was for nations, and kings of people shall be from her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Abraham will fall upon his face and laugh, and will say in his heart, Shall there be born to the son of a hundred years? and shall Sarah the daughter of ninety years, bring forth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Abraham will say to God, O for Ishmael to live before thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And God will say. Truly, Sarah thy wife, shall bring forth to thee a son, and shall call his name Isaak: and I set up my covenant with him for a lasting covenant, and to his seed after him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I blessed him and made him fruitful, and I multiplied him with might exceedingly: twelve chiefs shall he beget, and I will give him into a great nation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And my covenant will I set up with Isaak whom Sarah shall bring forth to thee at this appointed time in another year.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And he will finish speaking with him, and God will go up from Abraham.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Abraham will take Ishmael his son, and all born in his house and bought with his silver, every male among the men of Abrahamâ€™s house, and he will circumcise the flesh of their uncircumcision, in the self-same day, according to which God spake to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Abraham, the son of ninety and nine years in his circumcising the flesh of his uncircumcision.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Ishmael his son, the son of thirteen years in his circumcising the flesh of his uncircumcision.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And in the self-same day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And all the men of his house, born in his house, and bought with silver of the son of the stranger, were circumcised with him.</p>
