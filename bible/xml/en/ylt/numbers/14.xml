  <verse number="1">And all the company lifteth up and give forth their voice, and the people weep during that night;</verse>
  <verse number="2">and all the sons of Israel murmur against Moses, and against Aaron, and all the company say unto them, ‘O that we had died in the land of Egypt, or in this wilderness, O that we had died!</verse>
  <verse number="3">and why is Jehovah bringing us in unto this land to fall by the sword? our wives and our infants are become a prey; is it not good for us to turn back to Egypt?’</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they say one unto another, ‘Let us appoint a head, and turn back to Egypt.’</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Moses falleth—Aaron also—on their faces, before all the assembly of the company of the sons of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Joshua son of Nun, and Caleb son of Jephunneh, of those spying the land, have rent their garments,</verse>
  <verse number="7">and they speak unto all the company of the sons of Israel, saying, ‘The land into which we have passed over to spy it, is a very very good land;</verse>
  <verse number="8">if Jehovah hath delighted in us, then He hath brought us in unto this land, and hath given it to us, a land which is flowing with milk and honey;</verse>
  <verse number="9">only, against Jehovah rebel not ye: and ye, fear not ye the people of the land, for our bread they are; their defence hath turned aside from off them, and Jehovah is with us; fear them not.’</verse>
  <verse number="10">And all the company say to stone them with stones, and the honour of Jehovah hath appeared in the tent of meeting unto all the sons of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Jehovah saith unto Moses, ‘Until when doth this people despise Me? and until when do they not believe in Me, for all the signs which I have done in its midst?</verse>
  <verse number="12">I smite it with pestilence, and dispossess it, and make thee become a nation greater and mightier than it.’</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Moses saith unto Jehovah, ‘Then have the Egyptians heard! for Thou hast brought up with Thy power this people out of their midst,</verse>
  <verse number="14">and they have said it unto the inhabitant of this land, they have heard that Thou, Jehovah, art in the midst of this people, that eye to eye Thou art seen—O Jehovah, and Thy cloud is standing over them,—and in a pillar of cloud Thou art going before them by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.</verse>
  <verse number="15">‘And Thou hast put to death this people as one man, and the nations who have heard Thy fame have spoken, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="16">From Jehovah’s want of ability to bring in this people unto the land which He hath sworn to them—He doth slaughter them in the wilderness.</verse>
  <verse number="17">‘And now, let, I pray Thee, the power of my Lord be great, as Thou hast spoken, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="18">Jehovah is slow to anger, and of great kindness; bearing away iniquity and transgression, and not entirely acquitting, charging iniquity of fathers on sons, on a third generation, and on a fourth;—</verse>
  <verse number="19">forgive, I pray Thee, the iniquity of this people, according to the greatness of Thy kindness, and as Thou hast borne with this people from Egypt, even until now.’</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Jehovah saith, ‘I have forgiven, according to thy word;</verse>
  <verse number="21">and yet, I live—and it is filled—the whole earth—with the honour of Jehovah;</verse>
  <verse number="22">for all the men who are seeing My honour, and My signs, which I have done in Egypt, and in the wilderness, and try Me these ten times, and have not hearkened to My voice—</verse>
  <verse number="23">they see not the land which I have sworn to their fathers, yea, none of those despising Me see it;</verse>
  <verse number="24">and My servant Caleb, because there hath been another spirit with him, and he is fully after Me—I have brought him in unto the land whither he hath entered, and his seed doth possess it.</verse>
  <verse number="25">‘And the Amalekite and the Canaanite are dwelling in the valley; to-morrow turn ye and journey for yourselves into the wilderness—the way of the Red Sea.’</verse>
  <verse number="26">And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, and unto Aaron, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="27">‘Until when hath this evil company that which they are murmuring against Me? the murmurings of the sons of Israel, which they are murmuring against Me, I have heard;</verse>
  <verse number="28">say unto them, I live—an affirmation of Jehovah—if, as ye have spoken in Mine ears—so I do not to you;</verse>
  <verse number="29">in this wilderness do your carcases fall, even all your numbered ones, to all your number, from a son of twenty years and upward, who have murmured against Me;</verse>
  <verse number="30">ye—ye come not in unto the land which I have lifted up My hand to cause you to tabernacle in it, except Caleb son of Jephunneh, and Joshua son of Nun.</verse>
  <verse number="31">‘As to your infants—of whom ye have said, A spoil they are become—I have even brought them in, and they have known the land which ye have kicked against;</verse>
  <verse number="32">as to you—your carcases do fall in this wilderness,</verse>
  <verse number="33">and your sons are evil in the wilderness forty years, and have borne your whoredoms till your carcases are consumed in the wilderness;</verse>
  <verse number="34">by the number of the days in which ye spied the land, forty days,—a day for a year, a day for a year—ye do bear your iniquities, forty years, and ye have known my breaking off;</verse>
  <verse number="35">I am Jehovah, I have spoken; if I do not this to all this evil company who are meeting against me;—in this wilderness they are consumed, and there they die.’</verse>
  <verse number="36">And the men whom Moses hath sent to spy the land, and they turn back and cause all the company to murmur against him, by bringing out an evil account concerning the land,</verse>
  <verse number="37">even the men bringing out an evil account of the land die by the plague before Jehovah;</verse>
  <verse number="38">and Joshua son of Nun, and Caleb son of Jephunneh, have lived of those men who go to spy out the land.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And Moses speaketh these words unto all the sons of Israel, and the people mourn exceedingly,</verse>
  <verse number="40">and they rise early in the morning, and go up unto the top of the mountain, saying, ‘Here we are, and we have come up unto the place which Jehovah hath spoken of, for we have sinned.’</verse>
  <verse number="41">And Moses saith, ‘Why is this?—ye are transgressing the command of Jehovah, and it doth not prosper;</verse>
  <verse number="42">go not up, for Jehovah is not in your midst, and ye are not smitten before your enemies;</verse>
  <verse number="43">for the Amalekite and the Canaanite are there before you, and ye have fallen by the sword, because that ye have turned back from after Jehovah, and Jehovah is not with you.’</verse>
  <verse number="44">And they presume to go up unto the top of the mountain, and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and Moses have not departed out of the midst of the camp.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And the Amalekite and the Canaanite who are dwelling in that mountain come down and smite them, and beat them down—unto Hormah.</verse>
