  <verse number="1">Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grape gleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat; my soul desireth the firstripe fig.</verse>
  <verse number="2">The godly man is perished out of the earth, and there is none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Their hands are upon that which is evil to do it diligently; the prince asketh, and the judge is ready for a reward; and the great man, he uttereth the mischief of his soul: thus they weave it together.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is worse than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen, even thy visitation, is come; now shall be their perplexity.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man’s enemies are the men of his own house.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But as for me, I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God of my salvation: my God will hear me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned against him; until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold his righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her; which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? Mine eyes shall behold her; now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets.</verse>
  <verse number="11">A day for building thy walls! in that day shall the decree be far removed.</verse>
  <verse number="12">In that day shall they come unto thee, from Assyria and the cities of Egypt, and from Egypt even to the River, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Yet shall the land be desolate because of them that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily, in the forest in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.</verse>
  <verse number="15">As in the days of thy coming forth out of the land of Egypt will I shew unto him marvelous things.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall be deaf.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They shall lick the dust like a serpent; like crawling things of the earth they shall come trembling out of their close places: they shall come with fear unto the LORD our God, and shall be afraid because of thee.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in mercy.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He will turn again and have compassion upon us; he will tread our iniquities under foot: and thou wilt cast all their sins into the depths of the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.</verse>
