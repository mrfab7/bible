<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Ephraim fed upon the wind, and he pursued the east wind: all the day he multiplied falsehood and destruction; and they will cut out a covenant with Assur, and oil will be brought to Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And a contention to Jehovah with Judah, and to review Jacob according to his ways; he will turn back to him according to his doings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">In the belly he circumvented his brother, and by his strength he was a leader with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he will be a leader to the messenger, and he will prevail: he wept, and he will make supplication to him: in the house of God he will find him, and there he will speak with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Jehovah God of armies, Jehovah his remembrance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And thou, in thy God thou shalt turn back: watch mercy and judgment, and wait always for thy God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Canaan in his hand, the balances of deceit: he loved to oppress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Ephraim will say, Surely I became rich, I found to me wealth: all my labors shall not be found to me iniquity which was sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And I am Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt; I will even cause thee to dwell in tents as in the days of the appointment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I spake by the prophets, and I multiplied the vision, and by the hand of the prophets I will use similitudes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If Gilead nothing? Surely they were vanity: in Gilgal they sacrificed oxen; also their altars as heaps upon the furrows of the field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Jacob will flee to the field of Aram, and Israel will serve for a wife, and for a wife he watched.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And by a prophet Jehovah brought up Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was preserved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Ephraim provoked bitternesses, and bloods shall fly swiftly upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord turn back to him.</p>
