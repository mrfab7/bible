<chapter book="Ecclesiastes" number="3" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">To all a season, and a time to every inclination under the heavens:</verse>
  <verse number="2">A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up the planting.</verse>
  <verse number="3">A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build:</verse>
  <verse number="4">A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance:</verse>
  <verse number="5">A time to cast away stones, and a time to collect stones a time to embrace, and a time to be far from embracing:</verse>
  <verse number="6">A time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to watch, and a time to cast away.</verse>
  <verse number="7">A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to be silent, and a time to speak:</verse>
  <verse number="8">A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace:</verse>
  <verse number="9">What the excellence of him working in what he labored?</verse>
  <verse number="10">I saw the labor which God gave to the sons of man to be humbled in it.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He made everything beautiful in his time: also he gave hidden time in their heart, so that man shall not find the work which God did from the beginning and even to the end.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I knew that no good is in them, but to rejoice and to do good in his life.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And also every man shall eat and drink, and see the good in all his labor; it is the gift of God.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I knew that all which God will do it shall be forever: to it not to be added, and from it not to be taken away: and God doing they shall be afraid from his face.</verse>
  <verse number="15">What was, it is already; and what to be, was already; and God will seek him being driven away.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And yet I saw under the sun the place of judgment, there the unjust one; and the place of the just one, there the unjust one.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I said in my heart, The just one and the unjust one, God will judge: for a time for every inclination and for every work there.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I said in my heart concerning the speeches of the sons of man, for God to separate them, and for them to see that they are cattle to themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For the event of the sons of man, and the event of the cattle, one event to them: as this, so dies this; and the breath of one to all; and the preeminence of man not above the cattle: for all is vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="20">All go to one place; all were from dust, and all turned back to dust.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Who shall know the spirit of the sons of man? it ascending to above, and the spirit of cattle, it going downwards to the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And I saw that no good more than that man shall rejoice in his works; for this is his portion: for who shall bring him to look upon what shall be after him?</verse>
