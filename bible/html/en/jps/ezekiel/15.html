<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Son of man, what is the vine-tree more than any tree, the vine branch which grew up among the trees of the forest?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Shall wood be taken thereof to make any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire hath devoured both the ends of it, and the midst of it is singed; is it profitable for any work?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work; how much less, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is singed, shall it yet be meet for any work?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: As the vine-tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so do I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I will set My face against them; out of the fire are they come forth, and the fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I set My face against them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And I will make the land desolate, because they have acted treacherously, saith the Lord GOD.â€™</p>
