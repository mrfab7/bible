<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="13" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The burden of Babel which Isaiah son of Amos saw.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Lift ye up a signal upon the bare mountain, lift up the voice to them; move the hand to and fro and they shall come in to the entrances of the noble minded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I commanded to the consecrated, also I called the strong ones for mine anger, those exulting in my lifting up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The voice of a multitude in the mountain; the likeness of much people; the voice of the uproar of kingdoms, nations being gathered: Jehovah of armies reviewing the army of battle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Coming from a land from afar, from the extremity of the heavens, Jehovah and the vessels of his wrath to overthrow all the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Pipe ye, for the day of Jehovah draws near; as desolation shall it come from the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For this all hands shall be relaxed, and every heart of man shall melt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And they trembled; pains and writhings will lay hold of them; as she bringing forth they will be in pain: they shall wonder a man at his neighbor; their faces the face of flames.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Behold, the day of Jehovah coming fierce and overflowing, and burning anger to set the earth for desolation: and he will destroy the sinner out of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For the stars of the heavens and the giants of the sky shall not shine their light: the sun was darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And I appointed evil over the habitable globe, and upon the unjust their iniquity; and I caused to cease the pride of the arrogant, and I will humble the pride of the terrible.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I will make a man precious above pure gold, and a man above the gold of Ophir.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For this I will provoke the heavens to anger, and the earth shall tremble from her place, in the wrath of Jehovah of armies, and in the day of his burning anger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And it was as the roe being thrust down and as a sheep and not a man gathering: to his people shall they turn, and they shall flee a man to his land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All being found shall be thrust through; and every one scraped together shall fall by the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And their children shall be dashed in pieces before their eyes, and their houses shall be plundered, and their wives shall be ravished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Behold me rousing up the Modes against them, who shall not reckon silver; and gold they shall not delight in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the bows of the boys shall be dashed in pieces, and the fruit of the womb they shall not pity; and upon their sons their eye shall not have compassion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Babel the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeesâ€™ grandeur was as God overthrowing Sodom and Gomorrah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">It shall not be inhabited forever, and it shall not be dwelt in even to generation and generation: and the Arabian shall not go on there, and the shepherds shall not recline there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And inhabitants of the desert reclined there, and their houses were filled with howlings, and the daughters of the ostrich dwelt there, and he goats shall leap there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And howlers cried out in its palaces, and great serpents in the temples of delight: and her time draws near to come, and her days shall not be protracted.</p>
