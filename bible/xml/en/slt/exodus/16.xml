  <verse number="1">And they will remove from Ailam, and all the assembly of the sons of Israel will come to the desert of Sin, which is between Ailam and between Sinai, the fifteenth day of the second month of their coming out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And all the assembly of the sons of Israel will murmur against Moses and against Aaron in the desert.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the sons of Israel will say to them, Who will give to die by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt in our sitting by the pot of flesh, in our eating bread to satiety? for ye brought us forth to this desert to kill all this convocation with hunger.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Jehovah will say to Moses, Behold me raining for you bread from the heavens; and the people shall go forth and shall gather the word of a day in its day, so that I shall try them, whether they will go in my law or not.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And it was in the sixth day, and they prepared what they shall bring in; and it was double to what they will gather day by day.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Moses will say, and Aaron, to all the sons of Israel, The evening, and ye knew that Jehovah brought you out of the land of Egypt:</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the morning, and ye saw the glory of Jehovah, in his hearing your murmurings against Jehovah and what are we that ye will murmur against us?</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Moses will say, In Jehovah giving you in the evening flesh to eat, and bread in the morning to satiety; in Jehovah hearing your murmurings which ye murmured against him: and what are we? not against us your murmurings but against Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Moses will say to Aaron, Say to all the assembly of the sons of Israel, Come near before Jehovah: for he heard your murmurings.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And it shall be as Aaron spake to all the assembly of the sons of Israel, and they will turn to the desert, and behold, the glory of Jehovah was seen in the cloud.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="12">I heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel; speak to them, saying, Between the two evenings ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread: and ye knew that I am Jehovah your God.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And it shall be in the evening, the quail shall come up and shall cover the camp: and in the morning the dew was lying round about the camp.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the dew lying will go up, and behold, upon the face of the desert a small thing being peeled off thin, as pitch upon the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the sons of Israel will see, and they will say, each to his brother, What this? for they knew not what it was And Moses will say to them, This the bread which Jehovah gave to you to eat.</verse>
  <verse number="16">This the word which Jehovah commanded, Gather ye from it, each according to the mouth of his eating: an omer for the head from the numbering of your souls, ye shall take each for those in his tent.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the sons of Israel will do so, and they will gather this much, and this little.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And they will measure by the handful, and the abundance did not exceed, and the little was not diminished: they gathered a man according to the mouth of his eating.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Moses will say to them, No man shall leave from it till morning.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And they heard not to Moses; and the men will leave from it till morning, and it will rot with worms, and it will stink: and Moses will be angry with them.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they will gather it in the morning by morning, a man according to the mouth of his eating: and the sun was hot and it melted.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And it will be in the sixth day, they gathered double the bread, two handfuls for one; and all the chiefs of the assembly will come and announce to Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he will say to them, This what Jehovah spake, To-morrow the Sabbath, a holy rest to Jehovah: what ye will cook, cook; and what ye will boil, boil; and all exceeding, leave for you for preservation till the morning.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And they left it till morning as Moses commanded: and it did not stink, and no worm was in it.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And Moses will say, Eat this day; for the Sabbath this day to Jehovah: this day ye shall not find in the field.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Six days ye shall gather, and in the seventh day, the Sabbath, it shall not be in it.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And it will be in the seventh day, and they will go forth from the people to gather, and they found not.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Jehovah will say to Moses, How long refused ye to watch my commands and my law?</verse>
  <verse number="29">See, for Jehovah gave to you the Sabbath; for this be gave to you in the sixth day, bread of two days: sit ye each in his station; a man shall not go forth from his place in the seventh day.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And the people shall rest in the seventh day.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the house of Israel will call its name portion: as the seed of coriander, white, and its taste as a flat cake with honey.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And Moses will say, This the word which Jehovah commanded, Fill the omer from it for a preservation to your generations; so that they shall see the bread which I gave you to eat in the desert in my bringing you forth out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And Moses will say to Aaron, Take one vase and give there an omer full of manna, and deposit it before Jehovah for a preservation to your generations.</verse>
  <verse number="34">As Jehovah commanded Moses, and Aaron will deposit it before the testimony for preservation.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the sons of Israel ate the manna forty years till they came to a land inhabited: they ate the portion till they came to the extremity of the land of Canaan.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And the omer the tenth of this ephah.</verse>
