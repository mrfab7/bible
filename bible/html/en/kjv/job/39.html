<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="39" data-translation="King James Bible" data-translation-id="kjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? [or] canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Canst thou number the months [that] they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The range of the mountains [is] his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Wilt thou trust him, because his strength [is] great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather [it into] thy barn?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">[Gavest thou] the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">She is hardened against her young ones, as though [they were] not hers: her labour is in vain without fear;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils [is] terrible.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in [his] strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that [it is] the sound of the trumpet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, [and] stretch her wings toward the south?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">From thence she seeketh the prey, [and] her eyes behold afar off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain [are], there [is] she.</p>
