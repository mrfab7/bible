  <verse number="1">Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:</verse>
  <verse number="2">“How long until you end these speeches? Show some sense, and then we can talk.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Why are we regarded as cattle, as stupid in your sight?</verse>
  <verse number="4">You who tear yourself in anger—should the earth be forsaken on your account, or the rocks be moved from their place?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Indeed, the lamp of the wicked is extinguished; the flame of his fire does not glow.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The light in his tent grows dark, and the lamp beside him goes out.</verse>
  <verse number="7">His vigorous stride is shortened, and his own schemes trip him up.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For his own feet lead him into a net, and he wanders into its mesh.</verse>
  <verse number="9">A trap seizes his heel; a snare grips him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">A noose is hidden in the ground, and a trap lies in his path.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Terrors frighten him on every side and harass his every step.</verse>
  <verse number="12">His strength is depleted, and calamity is ready at his side.</verse>
  <verse number="13">It devours patches of his skin; the firstborn of death devours his limbs.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He is torn from the shelter of his tent and is marched off to the king of terrors.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Fire resides in his tent; burning sulfur rains down on his dwelling.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The roots beneath him dry up, and the branches above him wither away.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The memory of him perishes from the earth, and he has no name in the land.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He is driven from light into darkness and is chased from the inhabited world.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He has no offspring or posterity among his people, no survivor where he once lived.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Those in the west are appalled at his fate, while those in the east tremble in horror.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Surely such is the dwelling of the wicked and the place of one who does not know God.”</verse>
