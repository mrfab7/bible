<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="29" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job will add to lift up his parable, and say,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Who will give me as the months of old, as the days God will watch me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">In his causing his light to shine upon my head, before his light I shall go through darkness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">As I was in the days of my ripeness, in the intercourse of God upon my tent;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">In the Almighty being yet with me, my youths round about me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In washing my goings with butter, and the rock will pour out with me streams of oil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In my going forth to the gate upon the city, in the street I shall prepare my seat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The young men saw me and hid themselves, and the old men rose up and stood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Chiefs held back in words, and they will put the hand to the mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The voice the leaders hid, and their tongue was joined to their palate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If the ear heard, and it will pronounce me happy; and the eye saw, and it will testify to me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For I shall deliver the poor crying, and the orphan, and none helping to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The praise of him perishing will come upon me, and I shall cause the heart of the widow to rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I put on justice and it will clothe me: my judgment as an upper garment and a turban.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Eyes was I to the blind one, and feet to the lame was I.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I was a father to the needy, and the contention I knew not I shall search it out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And I shall break the biterâ€™s teeth of the evil one, and I shall cast the prey from his teeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And saying, I shall expire with my nest I shall multiply days as the sand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">My root opened to the waters, and the dew will lodge upon my foliage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My glory new with me, and my bow will be changed in my hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">To me they heard, and they waited, and they will be silent for them at my counsel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">After my words they will not repeat, and my speech will drop upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And they waited for me as the rain, and they opened wide their mouth for the latter rain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">I shall laugh at them, they will not believe; and the light of my face they will not cast down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">I shall choose their way, and I shall sit the head, and I shall dwell as king in the troop, as he shall comfort those mourning.</p>
