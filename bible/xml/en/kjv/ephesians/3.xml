  <verse number="1">For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,</verse>
  <verse number="2">If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:</verse>
  <verse number="3">How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)</verse>
  <verse number="5">Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="6">That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:</verse>
  <verse number="7">Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="9">And to make all [men] see what [is] the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="10">To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly [places] might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,</verse>
  <verse number="11">According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:</verse>
  <verse number="12">In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
  <verse number="15">Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,</verse>
  <verse number="16">That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;</verse>
  <verse number="17">That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,</verse>
  <verse number="18">May be able to comprehend with all saints what [is] the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;</verse>
  <verse number="19">And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,</verse>
  <verse number="21">Unto him [be] glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.</verse>
