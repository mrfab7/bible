  <verse number="1">Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples,</verse>
  <verse number="2">saying, The scribes and the Pharisees have set themselves down in Moses’ seat:</verse>
  <verse number="3">all things therefore, whatever they may tell you, do and keep. But do not after their works, for they say and do not,</verse>
  <verse number="4">but bind burdens heavy and hard to bear, and lay them on the shoulders of men, but will not move them with their finger.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And all their works they do to be seen of men: for they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders [of their garments],</verse>
  <verse number="6">and love the chief place in feasts and the first seats in the synagogues,</verse>
  <verse number="7">and salutations in the market-places, and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But ye, be not ye called Rabbi; for one is your instructor, and all ye are brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And call not [any one] your father upon the earth; for one is your Father, he who is in the heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Neither be called instructors, for one is your instructor, the Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But the greatest of you shall be your servant.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And whoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled, and whoever shall humble himself shall be exalted.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye shut up the kingdom of the heavens before men; for ye do not enter, nor do ye suffer those that are entering to go in.</verse>
  <verse number="14"></verse>
  <verse number="15">Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye compass the sea and the dry [land] to make one proselyte, and when he is become [such], ye make him twofold more [the] son of hell than yourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Woe to you, blind guides, who say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Fools and blind, for which is greater, the gold, or the temple which sanctifies the gold?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it is a debtor.</verse>
  <verse number="19">[Fools and] blind ones, for which is greater, the gift, or the altar which sanctifies the gift?</verse>
  <verse number="20">He therefore that swears by the altar swears by it and by all things that are upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he that swears by the temple swears by it and by him that dwells in it.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he that swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him that sits upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye pay tithes of mint and anise and cummin, and ye have left aside the weightier matters of the law, judgment and mercy and faith: these ye ought to have done and not have left those aside.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Blind guides, who strain out the gnat, but drink down the camel.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but within they are full of rapine and intemperance.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Blind Pharisee, make clean first the inside of the cup and of the dish, that their outside also may become clean.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye are like whited sepulchres, which appear beautiful outwardly, but within are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Thus also ye, outwardly ye appear righteous to men, but within are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets and adorn the tombs of the just,</verse>
  <verse number="30">and ye say, If we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="31">So that ye bear witness of yourselves that ye are sons of those who slew the prophets:</verse>
  <verse number="32">and ye, fill ye up the measure of your fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Serpents, offspring of vipers, how should ye escape the judgment of hell?</verse>
  <verse number="34">Therefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes; and [some] of them ye will kill and crucify, and [some] of them ye will scourge in your synagogues, and will persecute from city to city;</verse>
  <verse number="35">so that all righteous blood shed upon the earth should come upon you, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Jerusalem, Jerusalem, [the city] that kills the prophets and stones those that are sent unto her, how often would I have gathered thy children as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!</verse>
  <verse number="38">Behold, your house is left unto you desolate;</verse>
  <verse number="39">for I say unto you, Ye shall in no wise see me henceforth until ye say, Blessed [be] he that comes in the name of [the] Lord.</verse>
