  <verse number="1">Jesus had left the Temple and was going on His way, when His disciples came and called His attention to the Temple buildings.</verse>
  <verse number="2">“You see all these?” He replied; “in solemn truth I tell you that there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be pulled down.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">Afterwards He was on the Mount of Olives and was seated there when the disciples came to Him, apart from the others, and said, “Tell us when this will be; and what will be the sign of your Coming and of the Close of the Age?”</verse>
  <verse number="4">“Take care that no one misleads you,” answered Jesus;</verse>
  <verse number="5">“for many will come assuming my name and saying ‘I am the Christ;’ and they will mislead many.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And before long you will hear of wars and rumours of wars. Do not be alarmed, for such things must be; but the End is not yet.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For nation will rise in arms against nation, kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places;</verse>
  <verse number="8">but all these miseries are but like the early pains of childbirth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">“At that time they will deliver you up to punishment and will put you to death; and you will be objects of hatred to all the nations because you are called by my name.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then will many stumble and fall, and they will betray one another and hate one another.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Many false prophets will rise up and lead multitudes astray;</verse>
  <verse number="12">and because of the prevalent disregard of God’s law the love of the great majority will grow cold;</verse>
  <verse number="13">but those who stand firm to the End shall be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And this Good News of the Kingdom shall be proclaimed throughout the whole world to set the evidence before all the Gentiles; and then the End will come.</verse>
  <verse number="15">“When you have seen (to use the language of the Prophet Daniel)</verse>
  <verse number="16">“then let those who are in Judaea escape to the hills;</verse>
  <verse number="17">let him who is on the roof not go down to fetch what is in his house;</verse>
  <verse number="18">nor let him who is outside the city stay to pick up his outer garment.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And alas for the women who at that time are with child or have infants!</verse>
  <verse number="20">“But pray that your flight may not be in winter, nor on the Sabbath;</verse>
  <verse number="21">for it will be a time of great suffering, such as never has been from the beginning of the world till now, and assuredly never will be again.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And if those days had not been cut short, no one would escape; but for the sake of God’s own People those days will be cut short.</verse>
  <verse number="23">“If at that time any one should say to you, ‘See, here is the Christ!’ or ‘Here!’ give no credence to it.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For there will rise up false Christs and false prophets, displaying wonderful signs and prodigies, so as to deceive, were it possible, even God’s own People.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Remember, I have forewarned you.</verse>
  <verse number="26">If therefore they should say to you, ‘See, He is in the Desert!’ do not go out there: or ‘See, He is indoors in the room!’ do not believe it.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For just as the lightning flashes in the east and is seen to the very west, so will be the Coming of the Son of Man.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Wherever the dead body is, there will the vultures flock together.</verse>
  <verse number="29">“But immediately after those times of distress the sun will be darkened, the moon will not shed her light, the stars will fall from the firmament, and the forces which control the heavens will be disordered and disturbed.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Then will appear the Sign of the Son of Man in the sky; and then will all the nations of the earth lament, when they see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with great power and glory.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And He will send out His angels with a loud trumpet-blast, and they will bring together His own People to Him from north, south, east and west—from one extremity of the world to the other.</verse>
  <verse number="32">“Now learn from the fig-tree the lesson it teaches. As soon as its branches have now become soft and it is bursting into leaf, you all know that summer is near.</verse>
  <verse number="33">So you also, when you see all these signs, may be sure that He is near—at your very door.</verse>
  <verse number="34">I tell you in solemn truth that the present generation will certainly not pass away without all these things having first taken place.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Earth and sky will pass away, but it is certain that my words will not pass away.</verse>
  <verse number="36">“But as to that day and the exact time no one knows—not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For as it was in the time of Noah, so it will be at the Coming of the Son of Man.</verse>
  <verse number="38">At that time, before the Deluge, men were busy eating and drinking, taking wives or giving them, up to the very day when Noah entered the Ark,</verse>
  <verse number="39">nor did they realise any danger till the Deluge came and swept them all away; so will it be at the Coming of the Son of Man.</verse>
  <verse number="40">Then will two men be in the open country: one will be taken away, and one left behind.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken away, and one left behind.</verse>
  <verse number="42">Be on the alert therefore, for you do not know the day on which your Lord is coming.</verse>
  <verse number="43">But of this be assured, that if the master of the house had known the hour at which the robber was coming, he would have kept awake, and not have allowed his house to be broken into.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Therefore you also must be ready; for it is at a time when you do not expect Him that the Son of Man will come.</verse>
  <verse number="45">“Who therefore is the loyal and intelligent servant to whom his master has entrusted the control of his household to give them their rations at the appointed time?</verse>
  <verse number="46">Blessed is that servant whom his master when he comes shall find so doing!</verse>
  <verse number="47">In solemn truth I tell you that he will give him the management of all his wealth.</verse>
  <verse number="48">But if the man, being a bad servant, should say in his heart, ‘My master is a long time in coming,’</verse>
  <verse number="49">and should begin to beat his fellow servants, while he eats and drinks with drunkards;</verse>
  <verse number="50">the master of that servant will arrive on a day when he is not expecting him and at an hour of which he has not been informed;</verse>
  <verse number="51">he will treat him with the utmost severity and assign him a place among the hypocrites: there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</verse>
