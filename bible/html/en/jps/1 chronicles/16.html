<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it, and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a cake made in a pan, and a sweet cake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to celebrate and to thank and praise the LORD, the God of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Then on that day did David first ordain to give thanks unto the LORD, by the hand of Asaph and his brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">O give thanks unto the LORD, call upon His name; Make known His doings among the peoples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Sing unto Him, sing praises unto Him; Speak ye of all His marvellous works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Glory ye in His holy name; Let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Seek ye the LORD and His strength; Seek His face continually.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Remember His marvellous works that He hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">O ye seed of Israel His servant, Ye children of Jacob, His chosen ones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He is the LORD our God; His judgments are in all the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Remember His covenant for ever, The word which He commanded to a thousand generations;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">[The covenant] which He made with Abraham, And His oath unto Isaac;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And He established it unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Saying: ‘Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">When ye were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And when they went about from nation to nation, And from one kingdom to another people,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He suffered no man to do them wrong, Yea, for their sake He reproved kings:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Touch not Mine anointed ones, And do My prophets no harm.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; Proclaim His salvation from day to day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Declare His glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For great is the LORD, and highly to be praised; He also is to be feared above all gods.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For all the gods of the peoples are things of nought; But the LORD made the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Honour and majesty are before Him; Strength and gladness are in His place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Ascribe unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the peoples, Ascribe unto the LORD glory and strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Ascribe unto the LORD the glory due unto His name; Bring an offering, and come before Him; Worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Tremble before Him, all the earth; The world also is established that it cannot be moved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; And let them say among the nations: ‘The LORD reigneth.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; Let the field exult, and all that is therein;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy, Before the LORD, for He is come to judge the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">O give thanks unto the LORD; for He is good; For His mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And say ye: ‘Save us, O God of our salvation, And gather us together and deliver us from the nations, That we may give thanks unto Thy holy name, That we may triumph in Thy praise.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said: ‘Amen,’ and praised the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jedithun and Hosah to be door-keepers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">to offer burnt-offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of burnt-offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the Law of the LORD, which He commanded unto Israel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because His mercy endureth for ever;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">and with them Heman and Jeduthun, to sound aloud with trumpets and cymbals, and with instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And all the people departed every man to his house; and David returned to bless his house.</p>
