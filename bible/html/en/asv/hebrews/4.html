<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Let us fear therefore, lest haply, a promise being left of entering into his rest, any one of you should seem to have come short of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For indeed we have had good tidings preached unto us, even as also they: but the word of hearing did not profit them, because it was not united by faith with them that heard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For we who have believed do enter into that rest; even as he hath said, As I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest:although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For he hath said somewhere of the seventh day on this wise, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and in this place again, They shall not enter into my rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Seeing therefore it remaineth that some should enter thereinto, and they to whom the good tidings were before preached failed to enter in because of disobedience,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">he again defineth a certain day, To-day, saying in David so long a time afterward (even as hath been said before), To-day if ye shall hear his voice, Harden not your hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken afterward of another day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">There remaineth therefore a sabbath rest for the people of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For he that is entered into his rest hath himself also rested from his works, as God did from his.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Let us therefore give diligence to enter into that rest, that no man fall after the same example of disobedience.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For the word of God is living, and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Having then a great high priest, who hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For we have not a high priest that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but one that hath been in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let us therefore draw near with boldness unto the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may find grace to help us in time of need.</p>
