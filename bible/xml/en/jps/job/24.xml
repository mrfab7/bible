  <verse number="1">Why are times not laid up by the Almighty? And why do not they that know Him see His days?</verse>
  <verse number="2">There are that remove the landmarks; They violently take away flocks, and feed them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">They drive away the ass of the fatherless, They take the widow’s ox for a pledge.</verse>
  <verse number="4">They turn the needy out of the way; The poor of the earth hide themselves together.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Behold, as wild asses in the wilderness They go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food; The desert yieldeth them bread for their children.</verse>
  <verse number="6">They cut his provender in the field; And they despoil the vineyard of the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They lie all night naked without clothing, And have no covering in the cold.</verse>
  <verse number="8">They are wet with the showers of the mountains, And embrace the rock for want of a shelter.</verse>
  <verse number="9">There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast, And take a pledge of the poor;</verse>
  <verse number="10">So that they go about naked without clothing, And being hungry they carry the sheaves;</verse>
  <verse number="11">They make oil within the rows of these men; They tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.</verse>
  <verse number="12">From out of the populous city men groan, And the soul of the wounded crieth out; Yet God imputeth it not for unseemliness.</verse>
  <verse number="13">These are of them that rebel against the light; They know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The murderer riseth with the light, to kill the poor and needy; And in the night he is as a thief.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, Saying: ‘No eye shall see me’; And he putteth a covering on his face.</verse>
  <verse number="16">In the dark they dig through houses; They shut themselves up in the day-time; They know not the light.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For the shadow of death is to all of them as the morning; For they know the terrors of the shadow of death.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He is swift upon the face of the waters; Their portion is cursed in the earth; He turneth not by the way of the vineyards.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Drought and heat consume the snow waters; So doth the nether-world those that have sinned.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The womb forgetteth him; the worm feedeth sweetly on him; He shall be no more remembered; And unrighteousness is broken as a tree.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He devoureth the barren that beareth not; And doeth not good to the widow.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He draweth away the mighty also by his power; He riseth up, and he trusteth not his own life.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth, Yet His eyes are upon their ways.</verse>
  <verse number="24">They are exalted for a little while, and they are gone; Yea, they are brought low, they are gathered in as all others, And wither as the tops of the ears of corn.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar, And make my speech nothing worth?</verse>
