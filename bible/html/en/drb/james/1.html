<div class="chapter" data-book="James" data-chapter="1" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">James the servant of God, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall into divers temptations;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And patience hath a perfect work; that you may be perfect and entire, failing in nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men abundantly, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the rich, in his being low; because as the flower of the grass shall he pass away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the sun rose with a burning heat, and parched the grass, and the flower thereof fell off, and the beauty of the shape thereof perished: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been proved, he shall receive a crown of life, which God hath promised to them that love him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God. For God is not a tempter of evils, and he tempteth no man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Then when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. But sin, when it is completed, begetteth death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Every best gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change, nor shadow of alteration.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth, that we might be some beginning of his creatures.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">You know, my dearest brethren. And let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak, and slow to anger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Wherefore casting away all uncleanness, and abundance of naughtiness, with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For if a man be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he shall be compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For he beheld himself, and went his way, and presently forgot what manner of man he was.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty, and hath continued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; this man shall be blessed in his deed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And if any man think himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation: and to keep one’s self unspotted from this world.</p>
