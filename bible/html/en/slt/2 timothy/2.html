<div class="chapter" data-book="2 Timothy" data-chapter="2" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Thou therefore, my child, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And what thou hast heard from me by many witnesses, these things lay by for faithful men, who will be sufficient to teach others also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thou therefore suffer ill treatment, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">None making war is entangled with the affairs of life: that he may please him having enlisted him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And also if any contend for a prize, he is not crowned, except he contend for a prize lawfully.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The farmer toiling must first participate in the fruits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Observe what I say; for may the Lord give to thee understanding in all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Remember Jesus Christ raised from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my good news:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">In which I suffer ill treatment, to bonds, as an evil doer; but the word of God has not been bound.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For this I endure all things for the chosen, that they also might attain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Faithful the word: For if we died together, we shall also live together:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If we endure, we shall also reign together: if we deny, he will also deny us:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If we believe not, he remains faithful: he cannot deny himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Put these things in mind, calling to witness before the Lord not to wrangle for nothing useful, to the subversion of them hearing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Be earnest to present thyself acceptable to God, a worker without shame, dividing rightly the word of truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And avoid profane, empty discourses: for they will proceed to more of profanation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And this word as a gangrene, will have an eating ulcer: of whom is Hymeneus and Philetus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Who concerning the truth missed their aim, saying the rising up has already been; and they subvert the faith of some.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Truly the firm foundation of God has stood, having this seal, The Lord knows them being his. And, Let every one naming the name of Christ remove from iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And in a great house there is not only gold and silver vessels, but also wood and earthen; and some truly for honour, and some for dishonour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">If therefore any cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel for honour, consecrated, and useful for the master, prepared for every good work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And flee youthful, eager desires: and follow justice, faith, love, peace, with them calling upon the Lord from a pure heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And silly and ignorant questions refuse, knowing that they produce strifes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And the servant of the Lord must not contend; but be gentle to all, giving instruction, enduring evil,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">In meekness instructing them being in a contrary state; lest perhaps God may give them repentance to the acknowledgment of the truth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">That they may return to a state of sobriety from the snare of the devil, being taken alive by him at his will.</p>
