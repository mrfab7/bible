<p class="verse" data-verse="1">These things Jesus spoke, and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son may glorify thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">as thou hast given him authority over all flesh, that [as to] all that thou hast given to him, he should give them life eternal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And this is the eternal life, that they should know thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I have glorified thee on the earth, I have completed the work which thou gavest me that I should do it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and now glorify me, thou Father, along with thyself, with the glory which I had along with thee before the world was.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest me out of the world. They were thine, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Now they have known that all things that thou hast given me are of thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">for the words which thou hast given me I have given them, and they have received [them], and have known truly that I came out from thee, and have believed that thou sentest me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I demand concerning them; I do not demand concerning the world, but concerning those whom thou hast given me, for they are thine,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">(and all that is mine is thine, and [all] that is thine mine,) and I am glorified in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And I am no longer in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one as we.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When I was with them I kept them in thy name; those thou hast given me I have guarded, and not one of them has perished, but the son of perdition, that the scripture might be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And now I come to thee. And these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I have given them thy word, and the world has hated them, because they are not of the world, as I am not of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I do not demand that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them out of evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">They are not of the world, as I am not of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Sanctify them by the truth: thy word is truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">As thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and I sanctify myself for them, that they also may be sanctified by truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And I do not demand for these only, but also for those who believe on me through their word;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">that they may be all one, as thou, Father, [art] in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the glory which thou hast given me I have given them, that they may be one, as we are one;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">I in them and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one [and] that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and [that] thou hast loved them as thou hast loved me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Father, [as to] those whom thou hast given me, I desire that where I am they also may be with me, that they may behold my glory which thou hast given me, for thou lovedst me before [the] foundation of [the] world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Righteous Father,â€”and the world has not known thee, but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And I have made known to them thy name, and will make [it] known; that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them and I in them.</p>
