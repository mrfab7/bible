<chapter book="Exodus" number="19" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">In the third month, when the children of Israel were gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they into the wilderness of Sinai.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For they were departed from Rephidim, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him out of the mountain, saying, Thus shall you say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel;</verse>
  <verse number="4">You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles’ wings, and brought you to myself.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:</verse>
  <verse number="6">And you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD has spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the LORD said to Moses, See, I come to you in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with you, and believe you for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the LORD said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them to day and to morrow, and let them wash their clothes,</verse>
  <verse number="11">And be ready against the third day: for the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people on mount Sinai.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And you shall set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that you go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whoever touches the mount shall be surely put to death:</verse>
  <verse number="13">There shall not an hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned, or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mount.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Moses went down from the mount to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he said to the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightning, and a thick cloud on the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended on it in fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the LORD came down on mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses up to the top of the mount; and Moses went up.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the LORD said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And let the priests also, which come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth on them.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Moses said to the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for you charged us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the LORD said to him, Away, get you down, and you shall come up, you, and Aaron with you: but let not the priests and the people break through to come up to the LORD, lest he break forth on them.</verse>
  <verse number="25">So Moses went down to the people, and spoke to them.</verse>
