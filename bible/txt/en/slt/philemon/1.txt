1	PAUL, imprisoned of Jesus Christ, Timothy the brother, to Philemon, dearly beloved, and cooperating,
2	And to the dearly beloved Apphia, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the church in thy house:
3	Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.
4	I thank my God, always making remembrance of thee in my prayers,
5	Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast to the Lord Jesus, and to all the holy;
6	So that the mutual participation of thy faith might be effective in acknowledgment of every good in you to Christ Jesus.
7	For we have much grace and consolation upon thy love, for the bowels of the holy are refreshed by thee, brother.
8	Wherefore, having much freedom of speech in Christ to enjoin thee what concerns thee,
9	By love I beseech rather, being such as Paul an aged man, and now also the imprisoned of Jesus Christ.
10	I beseech thee for my child whom I begat in my bonds, Onesimus.
11	Once unprofitable to thee, but now more profitable to thee and to me:
12	Whom I sent back: and thou him, that is, my bowels, receive again:
13	Whom I was wishing to retain to myself, that for thee he might serve me in the bonds of the good news:
14	But without thy judgment I would do nothing; that good might not be as according to necessity, but according to free will.
15	For perhaps therefore he was separated for a time, that thou mightest receive him forever;
16	No more as a servant, but above a servant, a dearly beloved brother, especially to me, and how much rather to thee, also in the flesh, and in the Lord?
17	If therefore thou hold me a participator, receive him in addition as me.
18	And if he injured thee any, or is indebted, charge this to me.
19	I Paul wrote with my hand, I will pay back: that I say not to thee, for thou owest thyself to me also in addition.
20	Yea, brother, may I be profited by thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
21	Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote to thee, knowing that thou wilt do above what I say to thee.
22	And at the same time also prepare for me a reception as a guest: for I hope that by your prayers I shall be given as a favor to you.
23	Epaphras greets thee, my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus;
24	Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my co-workers.
25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with your spirit. Amen.
