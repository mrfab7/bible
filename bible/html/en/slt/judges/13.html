<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the sons of Israel will add to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah; and Jehovah will give them into the hand of Philisteim forty years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And there will be one man from Zorah from the families of the Danites, and his name Manoah; and his wife sterile, and she bare not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And a messenger of Jehovah will be seen to the woman, and will say to her, Behold, now, thou art barren, and bearest not; and thou conceivedst and bearest a son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And now, watch now, and drink not wine and strong drink, and thou shalt not eat any thing unclean:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For behold thee pregnant, and thou bearest a son; and a razor shall not come up upon his head, for the boy shall be consecrated to God from the womb: and he shall begin to save Israel from the hand of Philisteim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the woman will go and will say to her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his sight as the sight of the messenger of God, very terrible: and I asked him not from whence he is, and his name he announced not to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he will say to me, Behold, thee conceiving, and thou bearest a son; and now drink not wine and strong drink, and thou shalt not eat any thing unclean, for the boy shall be consecrated to God from the womb, even to the day of his death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Manoah will pray to Jehovah and will say, With leave, my Lord, a man of God which thou sentest will he come now yet to us, and he will teach us what we shall do to the boy being brought forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And God will hear to the voice of Manoah, and the messenger of God will come yet to the woman, and she will sit in the field; and Manoah her man not with her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the woman will hasten and run, and announce to her man, and will say to him, Behold, the man was seen to me who came in the day to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Manoah will rise and will go after his wife, and will come to the man, and will say to him, Thou the man who spake to the woman? and he will say, I.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Manoah will say, Now shall come thy words. What shall be the judgment of the boy, and his work?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the messenger of Jehovah will say to Manoah, From all I said to the woman she shall watch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">From all going forth from the vine of the wine she shall not eat, and wine and strong drink she shall not drink, and any thing unclean she shall not eat: all which I commanded she shall watch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Manoah will say to the messenger of Jehovah, We will detain thee now, and we will do before thee a kid of the goats.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the messenger of Jehovah will say to Manoah, If thou shalt detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou shalt do a burnt-offering thou shalt do it to Jehovah. For Manoah knew not that he was a messenger of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Manoah will say to the messenger of Jehovah, What thy name, when shall come thy words and we honored thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the messenger of Jehovah will say to him, Wherefore this wilt thou ask for my name, and it is wonderful?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Manoah will take a kid of the goats, and the gift, and will bring up, upon the rock to Jehovah; and he separating to do, and Manoah and his wife seeing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And it will be in the going up of the flame from the altar to the heavens, and the messenger of Jehovah will go up in the flame of the altar and Manoah and his wife seeing; and they will fall upon their face to the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the messenger of Jehovah will no more add to be seen to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he is the messenger of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Manoah will say to his wife, Dying, we shall die, because we saw God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And his wife will say to him, If Jehovah were inclined to put us to death, he took not from our hand a burnt-offering and gift, and he shewed us not all these, and as now caused us not to hear such as this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And the woman will bear a son, and she will call his name Samson. And the boy will grow, and Jehovah will bless him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And the spirit of Jehovah will begin to move him in the camp of Dan, between Zorah and between Eshtaol.</p>
