<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And he said to Moses, Come up to the LORD, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship you afar off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Moses alone shall come near the LORD: but they shall not come near; neither shall the people go up with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD has said will we do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And he sent young men of the children of Israel, which offered burnt offerings, and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Moses took half of the blood, and put it in basins; and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he took the book of the covenant, and read in the audience of the people: and they said, All that the LORD has said will we do, and be obedient.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you concerning all these words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And they saw the God of Israel: and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone, and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And on the nobles of the children of Israel he laid not his hand: also they saw God, and did eat and drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the LORD said to Moses, Come up to me into the mount, and be there: and I will give you tables of stone, and a law, and commandments which I have written; that you may teach them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua: and Moses went up into the mount of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he said to the elders, Tarry you here for us, until we come again to you: and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you: if any man have any matters to do, let him come to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the glory of the LORD stayed on mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days: and the seventh day he called to Moses out of the middle of the cloud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the sight of the glory of the LORD was like devouring fire on the top of the mount in the eyes of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Moses went into the middle of the cloud, and got him up into the mount: and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.</p>
