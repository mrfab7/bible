<chapter book="Micah" number="1" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The word of Jehovah which was to Micah the Morasthite, in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah, who saw upon Shomeron and Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hear, all ye peoples; attend, O earth, and its fulness, and the Lord Jehovah shall be among you for a witness, Jehovah from his holy temple.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For behold, Jehovah will come forth from his place, and come down and tread upon the heights of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the mountains melted under him, and the valleys shall be cleft as wax from the face of the fire, as waters cast down in a descent.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For the transgression of Jacob all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel What the transgression of Jacob? Is it not Shomeron? And what the heights of Judah? Are they not Jerusalem?</verse>
  <verse number="6">And I set Shomeron for the rubbish of the field, for the plantings of a vineyard: and I poured down its stones into the valley, and I will uncover its foundations.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And all her carved images shall be beaten down, and all her gifts shall be burnt in fire, and all her images I will set a desolation: for she gathered from the gift of a harlot, and they shall turn back even to the gift of a harlot.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For this I will lament and wail; I will go stripped and naked: I will make wailing as jackals, and mourning as the daughters of the ostrich.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For her blow is incurable, for it came even to Judah; he touched even to the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Ye shall not announce in Gath; weeping, ye shall not weep: in the house of dust roll thyself in dust.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Pass away for you, thou fair one inhabiting the nakedness of shame: she inhabiting the place of flocks shall not go forth to the wailing of the house of firm root; he shall take from you his standing.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For she dwelling in bitterness was anxious for good: but evil came down from Jehovah to the gate of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Make fast the chariot to the steed, thou inhabitress of the smitten: she the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion: for in thee were found the transgressions of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For this thou shalt give a sending forth upon the possession of Gath: the houses of falsehood are for falsehood to the kings of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Yet I will bring to thee him possessing, O inhabitress at the head: he shall come even to Adullam, the glory of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Make bald, and shave for the sons of thy delights; increase thy baldness as the eagle; for they were carried away captive from thee.</verse>
