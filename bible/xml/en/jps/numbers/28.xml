  <verse number="1">And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Command the children of Israel, and say unto them: My food which is presented unto Me for offerings made by fire, of a sweet savour unto Me, shall ye observe to offer unto Me in its due season.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And thou shalt say unto them: This is the offering made by fire which ye shall bring unto the LORD: he-lambs of the first year without blemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt-offering.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at dusk;</verse>
  <verse number="5">and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil.</verse>
  <verse number="6">It is a continual burnt-offering, which was offered in mount Sinai, for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the drink-offering thereof shall be the fourth part of a hin for the one lamb; in the holy place shalt thou pour out a drink-offering of strong drink unto the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the other lamb shalt thou present at dusk; as the meal-offering of the morning, and as the drink-offering thereof, thou shalt present it, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And on the sabbath day two he-lambs of the first year without blemish, and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, and the drink-offering thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="10">This is the burnt-offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And in your new moons ye shall present a burnt-offering unto the LORD: two young bullocks, and one ram, seven he-lambs of the first year without blemish;</verse>
  <verse number="12">and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for each bullock; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal-offering, mingled with oil, for the one ram;</verse>
  <verse number="13">and a several tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal-offering unto every lamb; for a burnt-offering of a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And their drink-offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bullock, and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part of a hin for a lamb. This is the burnt-offering of every new moon throughout the months of the year.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And one he-goat for a sin-offering unto the LORD; it shall be offered beside the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is the LORD’S passover.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And on the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast; seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.</verse>
  <verse number="18">In the first day shall be a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work;</verse>
  <verse number="19">but ye shall present an offering made by fire, a burnt-offering unto the LORD: two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven he-lambs of the first year; they shall be unto you without blemish;</verse>
  <verse number="20">and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil; three tenth parts shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth parts for the ram;</verse>
  <verse number="21">a several tenth part shalt thou offer for every lamb of the seven lambs;</verse>
  <verse number="22">and one he-goat for a sin-offering, to make atonement for you.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Ye shall offer these beside the burnt-offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt-offering.</verse>
  <verse number="24">After this manner ye shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD; it shall be offered beside the continual burnt-offering, and the drink-offering thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And on the seventh day ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Also in the day of the first-fruits, when ye bring a new meal-offering unto the LORD in your feast of weeks, ye shall have a holy convocation: ye shall do no manner of servile work;</verse>
  <verse number="27">but ye shall present a burnt-offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD: two young bullocks, one ram, seven he-lambs of the first year;</verse>
  <verse number="28">and their meal-offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for each bullock, two tenth parts for the one ram,</verse>
  <verse number="29">a several tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;</verse>
  <verse number="30">one he-goat, to make atonement for you.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Beside the continual burnt-offering, and the meal-offering thereof, ye shall offer them—they shall be unto you without blemish—and their drink-offerings.</verse>
