<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then on the first Sabbath, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and she saw that the stone had been rolled away from the tomb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Therefore, she ran and went to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and she said to them, “They have taken the Lord away from the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Therefore, Peter departed with the other disciple, and they went to the tomb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Now they both ran together, but the other disciple ran more quickly, ahead of Peter, and so he arrived at the tomb first.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And when he bowed down, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not yet enter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then Simon Peter arrived, following him, and he entered the tomb, and he saw the linen cloths lying there,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and the separate cloth which had been over his head, not placed with the linen cloths, but in a separate place, wrapped up by itself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then the other disciple, who had arrived first at the tomb, also entered. And he saw and believed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For as yet they did not understand the Scripture, that it was necessary for him to rise again from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then the disciples went away again, each by himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But Mary was standing outside the tomb, weeping. Then, while she was weeping, she bowed down and gazed into the tomb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And she saw two Angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been placed, one at the head, and one at the feet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They say to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have placed him.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Jesus said to her: “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you seeking?” Considering that it was the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have moved him, tell me where you have placed him, and I will take him away.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Jesus said to her, “Mary!” And turning, she said to him, “Rabboni!” (which means, Teacher).</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Jesus said to her: “Do not touch me. For I have not yet ascended to my Father. But go to my brothers and tell them: ‘I am ascending to my Father and to your Father, to my God and to your God.’ ”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Mary Magdalene went, announcing to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord, and these are the things that he said to me.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Then, when it was late on the same day, on the first of the Sabbaths, and the doors were closed where the disciples were gathered, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst, and he said to them: “Peace to you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and side. And the disciples were gladdened when they saw the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Therefore, he said to them again: “Peace to you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">When he had said this, he breathed on them. And he said to them: “Receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Those whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them, and those whose sins you shall retain, they are retained.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Now Thomas, one of the twelve, who is called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus arrived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Therefore, the other disciples said to him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said to them, “Unless I will see in his hands the mark of the nails and place my finger into the place of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will not believe.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And after eight days, again his disciples were within, and Thomas was with them. Jesus arrived, though the doors had been closed, and he stood in their midst and said, “Peace to you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Next, he said to Thomas: “Look at my hands, and place your finger here; and bring your hand close, and place it at my side. And do not choose to be unbelieving, but faithful.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Thomas responded and said to him, “My Lord and my God.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Jesus said to him: “You have seen me, Thomas, so you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Jesus also accomplished many other signs in the sight of his disciples. These have not been written in this book.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But these things have been written, so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that, in believing, you may have life in his name.</p>
