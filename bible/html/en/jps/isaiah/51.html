<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Hearken to Me, ye that follow after righteousness, Ye that seek the LORD; Look unto the rock whence ye were hewn, And to the hole of the pit whence ye were digged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Look unto Abraham your father, And unto Sarah that bore you; For when he was but one I called him, And I blessed him, and made him many.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the LORD hath comforted Zion; He hath comforted all her waste places, And hath made her wilderness like Eden, And her desert like the garden of the LORD; Joy and gladness shall be found therein, Thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Attend unto Me, O My people, And give ear unto Me, O My nation; For instruction shall go forth from Me, And My right on a sudden for a light of the peoples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">My favour is near, My salvation is gone forth, And Mine arms shall judge the peoples; The isles shall wait for Me, And on Mine arm shall they trust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Lift up your eyes to the heavens, And look upon the earth beneath; For the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, And the earth shall wax old like a garment, And they that dwell therein shall die in like manner; But My salvation shall be for ever, And My favour shall not be abolished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Hearken unto Me, ye that know righteousness, The people in whose heart is My law; Fear ye not the taunt of men, Neither be ye dismayed at their revilings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, And the worm shall eat them like wool; But My favour shall be for ever, And My salvation unto all generations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; Awake, as in the days of old, The generations of ancient times. Art thou not it that hewed Rahab in pieces, That pierced the dragon?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Art thou not it that dried up the sea, The waters of the great deep; That made the depths of the sea a way For the redeemed to pass over?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, And come with singing unto Zion, And everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; They shall obtain gladness and joy, And sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I, even I, am He that comforteth you: Who art thou, that thou art afraid of man that shall die, And of the son of man that shall be made as grass;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And hast forgotten the LORD thy Maker, That stretched forth the heavens, And laid the foundations of the earth; And fearest continually all the day Because of the fury of the oppressor, As he maketh ready to destroy? And where is the fury of the oppressor?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He that is bent down shall speedily be loosed; And he shall not go down dying into the pit, Neither shall his bread fail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For I am the LORD thy God, Who stirreth up the sea, that the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is His name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And I have put My words in thy mouth, And have covered thee in the shadow of My hand, That I may plant the heavens, And lay the foundations of the earth, And say unto Zion: ‘Thou art My people.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Awake, awake, Stand up, O Jerusalem, That hast drunk at the hand of the LORD The cup of His fury; Thou hast drunken the beaker, even the cup of staggering, And drained it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">There is none to guide her Among all the sons whom she hath brought forth; Neither is there any that taketh her by the hand Of all the sons that she hath brought up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">These two things are befallen thee; Who shall bemoan thee? Desolation and destruction, And the famine and the sword; How shall I comfort thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, As an antelope in a net; They are full of the fury of the LORD, The rebuke of thy God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, And drunken, but not with wine;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, And thy God that pleadeth the cause of His people: Behold, I have taken out of thy hand The cup of staggering; The beaker, even the cup of My fury, Thou shalt no more drink it again;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee; That have said to thy soul: ‘Bow down, that we may go over’; And thou hast laid thy back as the ground, And as the street, to them that go over.</p>
