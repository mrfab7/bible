<chapter book="Hosea" number="11" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called My son.</verse>
  <verse number="2">But the more I called Israel, the farther they departed from Me. They sacrificed to the Baals and burned incense to carved images.</verse>
  <verse number="3">It was I who taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by the arms, but they never realized that it was I who healed them.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I led them with cords of kindness, with ropes of love; I lifted the yoke from their necks and bent down to feed them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Will they not return to the land of Egypt and be ruled by Assyria because they refused to repent?</verse>
  <verse number="6">A sword will flash through their cities; it will destroy the bars of their gates and consume them in their own plans.</verse>
  <verse number="7">My people are bent on turning from Me. Though they call to the Most High, He will by no means exalt them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">How could I give you up, O Ephraim? How could I surrender you, O Israel? How could I make you like Admah? How could I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart is turned within Me; My compassion is stirred!</verse>
  <verse number="9">I will not execute the full fury of My anger; I will not destroy Ephraim again. For I am God and not man—the Holy One among you—and I will not come in wrath.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They will walk after the LORD; He will roar like a lion. When He roars, His children will come trembling from the west.</verse>
  <verse number="11">They will come trembling like birds from Egypt and like doves from the land of Assyria. Then I will settle them in their homes, declares the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Ephraim surrounds Me with lies, the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah still walks with God and is faithful to the Holy One.</verse>
