<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Gird up now thy loins like a man; and I will demand of thee, and inform thou me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Where wast thou when I founded the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who set the measures thereof—if thou knowest? or who stretched a line upon it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Whereupon were the foundations thereof sunken? or who laid its corner-stone,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And who shut up the sea with doors, when it burst forth, issuing out of the womb?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">When I made the cloud its garment, and thick darkness a swaddling band for it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">When I cut out for it my boundary, and set bars and doors,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And said, Hitherto shalt thou come and no further, and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Hast thou since thy days commanded the morning? hast thou caused the dawn to know its place,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, and the wicked might be shaken out of it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">It is changed like the signet-clay; and [all things] stand forth as in a garment:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the uplifted arm is broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Hast thou entered as far as the springs of the sea? and hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee? and hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Hath thine understanding compassed the breadths of the earth? Declare if thou knowest it all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Where is the way to where light dwelleth? and the darkness, where is its place,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">That thou shouldest take it to its bound, and that thou shouldest know the paths to its house?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Thou knowest, for thou wast then born, and the number of thy days is great!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Hast thou entered into the storehouses of the snow, and hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Which I have reserved for the time of distress, for the day of battle and war?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">By what way is the light parted, [and] the east wind scattered upon the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Who hath divided a channel for the rain-flood, and a way for the thunder’s flash;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">To cause it to rain on the earth, where no one is; on the wilderness wherein there is not a man;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">To satisfy the desolate and waste [ground], and to cause the sprout of the grass to spring forth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Hath the rain a father? or who begetteth the drops of dew?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Out of whose womb cometh the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who bringeth it forth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">When the waters lie hidden as in stone, and the face of the deep holdeth fast together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Canst thou fasten the bands of the Pleiades, or loosen the cords of Orion?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Dost thou bring forth the constellations each in its season? or dost thou guide the Bear with her sons?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens? dost thou determine their rule over the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Dost thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that floods of waters may cover thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Dost thou send forth lightnings that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the mind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Who numbereth the clouds with wisdom? or who poureth out the bottles of the heavens,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">When the dust runneth as into a molten mass, and the clods cleave fast together?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Dost thou hunt the prey for the lioness, and dost thou satisfy the appetite of the young lions,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">When they crouch in [their] dens, [and] abide in the thicket to lie in wait?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Who provideth for the raven his food, when his young ones cry unto God, [and] they wander for lack of meat?</p>
