<chapter book="Romans" number="14" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment on his opinions.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For one person has faith to eat all things, while another, who is weak, eats only vegetables.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The one who eats everything must not belittle the one who does not, and the one who does not eat everything must not judge the one who does, for God has accepted him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who are you to judge someone else’s servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand.</verse>
  <verse number="5">One person regards a certain day above the others, while someone else considers every day alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He who observes a special day does so to the Lord; he who eats does so to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For none of us lives to himself alone, and none of us dies to himself alone.</verse>
  <verse number="8">If we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For this reason Christ died and returned to life, that He might be the Lord of both the dead and the living.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Why, then, do you judge your brother? Or why do you belittle your brother? For we will all stand before God’s judgment seat.</verse>
  <verse number="11">It is written: “As surely as I live, says the Lord, every knee will bow before Me; every tongue will confess to God.”</verse>
  <verse number="12">So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Therefore let us stop judging one another. Instead, make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brother’s way.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I am convinced and fully persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean.</verse>
  <verse number="15">If your brother is distressed by what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not by your eating destroy your brother, for whom Christ died.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Do not allow what you consider good, then, to be spoken of as evil.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking, but of righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For whoever serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by men.</verse>
  <verse number="19">So then, let us pursue what leads to peace and to mutual edification.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to let his eating be a stumbling block.</verse>
  <verse number="21">It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything to cause your brother to stumble.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Keep your belief about such matters between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But the one who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because his eating is not from faith; and everything that is not from faith is sin.</verse>
