  <verse number="1">And Jehovah answered Job and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Shall he that will contend with the Almighty instruct [him]? he that reproveth +God, let him answer it.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Job answered Jehovah and said,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Behold, I am nought: what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; yea twice, but I will proceed no further.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,</verse>
  <verse number="7">Gird up now thy loins like a man: I will demand of thee, and inform thou me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Wilt thou also annul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me that thou mayest be righteous?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Deck thyself now with glory and excellency, and clothe thyself with majesty and splendour.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Cast abroad the ragings of thine anger, and look on every one that is proud, and abase him:</verse>
  <verse number="12">Look on every one that is proud, bring him low, and tread down the wicked in their place:</verse>
  <verse number="13">Hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in secret.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then will I also praise thee, because thy right hand saveth thee.</verse>
  <verse number="15">See now the behemoth, which I made with thee: he eateth grass as an ox.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Behold now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the muscles of his belly.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He bendeth his tail like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are woven together.</verse>
  <verse number="18">His bones are tubes of bronze, his members are like bars of iron.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He is the chief of God’s ways: he that made him gave him his sword.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He lieth under lotus-bushes, in the covert of the reed and fen:</verse>
  <verse number="22">Lotus-bushes cover him with their shade; the willows of the brook surround him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Lo, the river overfloweth—he startleth not: he is confident though a Jordan break forth against his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Shall he be taken in front? will they pierce through [his] nose in the trap?</verse>
