  <verse number="1">And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean.</verse>
  <verse number="4">If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that has the plague seven days:</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and, behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he has been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreads in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.</verse>
  <verse number="9">When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest;</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick raw flesh in the rising;</verse>
  <verse number="11">It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he is unclean.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of him that has the plague from his head even to his foot, wherever the priest looks;</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that has the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But when raw flesh appears in him, he shall be unclean.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed to white, he shall come to the priest;</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that has the plague: he is clean.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,</verse>
  <verse number="19">And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be showed to the priest;</verse>
  <verse number="20">And if, when the priest sees it, behold, it be in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:</verse>
  <verse number="22">And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot burning, and the quick flesh that burns have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white;</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then the priest shall look on it: and, behold, if the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning: why the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.</verse>
  <verse number="26">But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:</verse>
  <verse number="27">And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the burning.</verse>
  <verse number="29">If a man or woman have a plague on the head or the beard;</verse>
  <verse number="30">Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scale, even a leprosy on the head or beard.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And if the priest look on the plague of the scale, and, behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up him that has the plague of the scale seven days:</verse>
  <verse number="32">And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, if the scale spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scale be not in sight deeper than the skin;</verse>
  <verse number="33">He shall be shaven, but the scale shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up him that has the scale seven days more:</verse>
  <verse number="34">And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scale: and, behold, if the scale be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.</verse>
  <verse number="35">But if the scale spread much in the skin after his cleansing;</verse>
  <verse number="36">Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scale be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is unclean.</verse>
  <verse number="37">But if the scale be in his sight at a stay, and that there is black hair grown up therein; the scale is healed, he is clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</verse>
  <verse number="38">If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, even white bright spots;</verse>
  <verse number="39">Then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled spot that grows in the skin; he is clean.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet is he clean.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And he that has his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Then the priest shall look on it: and, behold, if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appears in the skin of the flesh;</verse>
  <verse number="44">He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent, and his head bore, and he shall put a covering on his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.</verse>
  <verse number="46">All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his habitation be.</verse>
  <verse number="47">The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woolen garment, or a linen garment;</verse>
  <verse number="48">Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woolen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;</verse>
  <verse number="49">And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be showed to the priest:</verse>
  <verse number="50">And the priest shall look on the plague, and shut up it that has the plague seven days:</verse>
  <verse number="51">And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.</verse>
  <verse number="52">He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woolen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.</verse>
  <verse number="53">And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;</verse>
  <verse number="54">Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:</verse>
  <verse number="55">And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his color, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be bore within or without.</verse>
  <verse number="56">And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:</verse>
  <verse number="57">And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: you shall burn that wherein the plague is with fire.</verse>
  <verse number="58">And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatever thing of skin it be, which you shall wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.</verse>
  <verse number="59">This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woolen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.</verse>
