  <verse number="1">And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his oldest son, and said to him, My son: and he said to him, Behold, here am I.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Now therefore take, I pray you, your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;</verse>
  <verse number="4">And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless you before I die.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="7">Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless you before the LORD before my death.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command you.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Go now to the flock, and fetch me from there two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for your father, such as he loves:</verse>
  <verse number="10">And you shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, and that he may bless you before his death.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:</verse>
  <verse number="12">My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse on me, and not a blessing.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And his mother said to him, On me be your curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her oldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son:</verse>
  <verse number="16">And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth of his neck:</verse>
  <verse number="17">And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he came to his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who are you, my son?</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau your first born; I have done according as you bade me: arise, I pray you, sit and eat of my venison, that your soul may bless me.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Isaac said to his son, How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD your God brought it to me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray you, that I may feel you, my son, whether you be my very son Esau or not.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Jacob went near to Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands: so he blessed him.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And he said, Are you my very son Esau? And he said, I am.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless you. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed:</verse>
  <verse number="28">Therefore God give you of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:</verse>
  <verse number="29">Let people serve you, and nations bow down to you: be lord over your brothers, and let your mother’s sons bow down to you: cursed be every one that curses you, and blessed be he that blesses you.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it to his father, and said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that your soul may bless me.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And Isaac his father said to him, Who are you? And he said, I am your son, your firstborn Esau.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that has taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before you came, and have blessed him? yes, and he shall be blessed.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And he said, Your brother came with subtlety, and has taken away your blessing.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Have you not reserved a blessing for me?</verse>
  <verse number="37">And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now to you, my son?</verse>
  <verse number="38">And Esau said to his father, Have you but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And Isaac his father answered and said to him, Behold, your dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;</verse>
  <verse number="40">And by your sword shall you live, and shall serve your brother; and it shall come to pass when you shall have the dominion, that you shall break his yoke from off your neck.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, your brother Esau, as touching you, does comfort himself, purposing to kill you.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee you to Laban my brother to Haran;</verse>
  <verse number="44">And tarry with him a few days, until your brother’s fury turn away;</verse>
  <verse number="45">Until your brother’s anger turn away from you, and he forget that which you have done to him: then I will send, and fetch you from there: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?</verse>
  <verse number="46">And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?</verse>
