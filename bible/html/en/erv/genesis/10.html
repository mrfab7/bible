<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem Ham and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Of these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands, every one after his tongue; after their families, in their nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabteca: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and builded Nineveh, and Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah,</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the border of the Canaanite was from Zidon, as thou goest toward Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest toward Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, unto Lasha.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And unto Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Arpachshad begat Shelah; and Shelah begat Eber.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of the one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brotherâ€™s name was Joktan.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest toward Sephar, the mountain of the east.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.</p>
