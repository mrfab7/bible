  <verse number="1">And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</verse>
  <verse number="2">In the middle of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bore twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God gives them light: and they shall reign for ever and ever.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he said to me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to show to his servants the things which must shortly be done.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keeps the sayings of the prophecy of this book.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then said he to me, See you do it not: for I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And he said to me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give every man according as his work shall be.</verse>
  <verse number="13">I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and fornicators, and murderers, and idolaters, and whoever loves and makes a lie.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I Jesus have sent my angel to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and the bright and morning star.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that hears say, Come. And let him that is thirsty come. And whoever will, let him take the water of life freely.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For I testify to every man that hears the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add to these things, God shall add to him the plagues that are written in this book:</verse>
  <verse number="19">And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.</verse>
  <verse number="20">He which testifies these things said, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.</verse>
