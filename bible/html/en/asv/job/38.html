<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Who is this that darkeneth counsel By words without knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Gird up now thy loins like a man; For I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who determined the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who stretched the line upon it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the corner-stone thereof,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When the morning stars sang together, And all the sons of God shouted for joy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Or who shut up the sea with doors, When it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">When I made clouds the garment thereof, And thick darkness a swaddling-band for it,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And marked out for it my bound, And set bars and doors,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further; And here shall thy proud waves be stayed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days began, And caused the dayspring to know its place;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, And the wicked be shaken out of it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">It is changed as clay under the seal; And all things stand forth as a garment:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And from the wicked their light is withholden, And the high arm is broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? Or hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee? Or hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Hast thou comprehended the earth in its breadth? Declare, if thou knowest it all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Where is the way to the dwelling of light? And as for darkness, where is the place thereof,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, And that thou shouldest discern the paths to the house thereof?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Doubtless, thou knowest, for thou wast then born, And the number of thy days is great!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow, Or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, Against the day of battle and war?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">By what way is the light parted, Or the east wind scattered upon the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood, Or the way for the lightning of the thunder;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">To cause it to rain on a land where no man is; On the wilderness, wherein there is no man;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">To satisfy the waste and desolate ground, And to cause the tender grass to spring forth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Hath the rain a father? Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Out of whose womb came the ice? And the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The waters hide themselves and become like stone, And the face of the deep is frozen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Canst thou bind the cluster of the Pleiades, Or loose the bands of Orion?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Canst thou lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season? Or canst thou guide the Bear with her train?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens? Canst thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, That abundance of waters may cover thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Canst thou send forth lightnings, that they may go, And say unto thee, Here we are?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who hath given understanding to the mind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">When the dust runneth into a mass, And the clods cleave fast together?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Canst thou hunt the prey for the lioness, Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">When they couch in their dens, And abide in the covert to lie in wait?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Who provideth for the raven his prey, When his young ones cry unto God, And wander for lack of food?</p>
