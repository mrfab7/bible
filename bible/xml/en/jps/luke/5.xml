  <verse number="1">On one occasion the crowd was pressing on Him and listening to God’s Message, while He was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He, however, saw two fishing-boats drawn up on the beach (for the men had gone away from them and were washing the nets)</verse>
  <verse number="3">and going on board one of them, which was Simon’s He asked him to push out a little from land. Then He sat down and taught the crowd of people from the boat.</verse>
  <verse number="4">When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, “Push out into deep water, and let down your nets for a haul.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">“Rabbi,” replied Peter, “all night long we have worked hard and caught nothing; but at your command I will let down the nets.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">This they did, and enclosed a vast number of fish; and their nets began to break.</verse>
  <verse number="7">So they signalled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them; they came, and they filled both the boats so that they almost sank.</verse>
  <verse number="8">When Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at the knees of Jesus, and exclaimed, “Master, leave my boat, for I am a sinful man.”</verse>
  <verse number="9"></verse>
  <verse number="10">and so were Simon’s partners James and John, the sons of Zabdi.)</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then, after bringing their boats to land, they left everything and followed Him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">On another occasion, when He was in one of the towns, there was a man there covered with leprosy, who, seeing Jesus, threw himself at His feet and implored Him, saying, “Sir, if only you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">Reaching out His hand and touching him, Jesus said, “I am willing; be cleansed!” And instantly the leprosy left him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He ordered him to tell no one. “But go,” He said, “show yourself to the Priest, and make the offering for your purification which Moses appointed, as evidence for them.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">But all the more the report about Him spread abroad, and great multitudes crowded to hear Him and to be cured of their diseases;</verse>
  <verse number="16">but Jesus Himself constantly withdrew into the Desert and there prayed.</verse>
  <verse number="17">One day He was teaching, and there were Pharisees and teachers of the Law sitting there who had come from every village in Galilee and Judaea and from Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was present for Him to cure people.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And a party of men came carrying a palsied man on a bed, and they endeavoured to bring him in and lay him before Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But when they could find no way of doing so because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down through the tiling—bed and all—into the midst, in front of Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="20">He saw their faith and said to him, “Friend, your sins are forgiven.”</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then the Scribes and Pharisees began to cavil, asking, “Who is this, uttering blasphemies? Who but God alone can forgive sins?”</verse>
  <verse number="22">Well aware of their reasonings, Jesus answered their questions by asking in turn, “What is this that you are debating in your hearts?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Which is easier?—to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Rise and walk’?</verse>
  <verse number="24">But to prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins”—Turning to the paralytic He said, “I bid you, Rise, take up your bed, and go home.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">Instantly he stood up in their presence, took up the mattress on which he had been lying, and went away to his home, giving glory to God.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Amazement seized them all. “Glory to God!” was the abiding feeling. Yet fear flashed through their minds and they said, “We have seen strange things to-day.”</verse>
  <verse number="27">After this He went out and noticed a tax-gatherer, Levi by name, sitting at the Toll office; and He said to him, “Follow me.”</verse>
  <verse number="28">He rose, left everything, and followed Him.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Levi also gave a great entertainment at his house in honour of Jesus, and there was a large party of tax-gatherers and others at table with them.</verse>
  <verse number="30">This led the Pharisees and Scribes of their party to expostulate with His disciples and ask, “Why are you eating and drinking with these tax-gatherers and notorious sinners?”</verse>
  <verse number="31">But Jesus replied to them, “It is not men in good health who require a physician, but the sick.</verse>
  <verse number="32">I have not come to call the righteous to repentance, but sinners.”</verse>
  <verse number="33">Again they said to Him, “John’s disciples fast often and pray, as do also those of the pharisees; but yours eat and drink.”</verse>
  <verse number="34">“Can you compel the bridal party to fast,” replied Jesus, “so long as they have the bridegroom among them?</verse>
  <verse number="35">But a time for this will come, when the Bridegroom has been taken away from them: then, at that time, they will fast.”</verse>
  <verse number="36">He also spoke in figurative language to them. “No one,” He said, “tears a piece from a new garment to mend an old one. Otherwise he would not only spoil the new, but the patch from the new would not match the old.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Nor does any one pour new wine into old wine-skins. Otherwise the new wine would burst the skins, the wine itself would be spilt, and the skins be destroyed.</verse>
  <verse number="38">But new wine must be put into fresh wineskins.</verse>
  <verse number="39">Nor does any one after drinking old wine wish for new; for he says, ‘The old is better.’”</verse>
