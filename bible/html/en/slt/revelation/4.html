<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After these things I saw, and, behold, a door opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard as of a trumpet speaking with me; saying, Come up here, and I will show thee what things must be after these.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And instantly I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sitting upon the throne.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he sitting was like the vision to a jasper stone and a sardine; and a rainbow round about the throne, like the vision to an emerald.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And round about the throne twenty-four thrones; and sitting upon the thrones I saw twenty-four elders, surrounded with white garments; and they had golden crowns upon their heads.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And from the throne go forth lightnings, and thunders, and voices: and seven torches of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And before the throne a sea of glass like crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the first living creature like a lion, and the second living creature like a calf, and the third living creature having the face as a man, and the fourth living creature like a spreading eagle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the four living creatures, one by itself, had six wings together round about; and within full of eyes; and they have no rest day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God, the Omnipotent Ruler, who was, and who being, and who coming.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And when the living creatures shall give glory and honour and thanks to him sitting on the throne, and to him living forever and ever,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The twenty-four elders will fall before him sitting on the throne, and will worship him living forever and ever, and will cast their crowns before the throne, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Worthy art thou, O Lord, to receive glory, and honour, and power; for thou didst create all things, and by thy will they are, and they were created.</p>
