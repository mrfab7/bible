  <verse number="1">And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made finely wrought garments, for ministering in the holy place, and made the holy garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, the work of the cunning workman.</verse>
  <verse number="4">They made shoulderpieces for it, joined together: at the two ends was it joined together.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the cunningly woven band, that was upon it, to gird it on withal, was of the same piece and like the work thereof; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And they wrought the onyx stones, enclosed in ouches of gold, graven with the engravings of a signet, according to the names of the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he made the breastplate, the work of the cunning workman, like the work of the ephod; of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.</verse>
  <verse number="9">It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being double.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they set in it four rows of stones: a row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle was the first row.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were enclosed in ouches of gold in their settings.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the stones were according to the names of the children of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet, every one according to his name, for the twelve tribes.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And they made upon the breastplate chains like cords, of wreathen work of pure gold.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And they put the two wreathen chains of gold on the two rings at the ends of the breastplate.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains they put on the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the ephod, in the forepart thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And they made two rings of gold, and put them upon the two ends of the breastplate, upon the edge thereof, which was toward the side of the ephod inward.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulderpieces of the ephod underneath, in the forepart thereof, close by the coupling thereof, above the cunningly woven band of the ephod.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they did bind the breastplate by the rings thereof unto the rings of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be upon the cunningly woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue;</verse>
  <verse number="23">and the hole of the robe in the midst thereof, as the hole of a coat of mail, with a binding round about the hole of it, that it should not be rent.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And they made upon the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the skirts of the robe round about, between the pomegranates;</verse>
  <verse number="26">a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, upon the skirts of the robe round about, to minister in; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And they made the coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and for his sons,</verse>
  <verse number="28">and the mitre of fine linen, and the goodly headtires of fine linen, and the linen breeches of fine twined linen,</verse>
  <verse number="29">and the girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, the work of the embroiderer; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote upon it a writing, like the engravings of a signet, HOLY TO THE LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it upon the mitre above; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Thus was finished all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of meeting: and the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the Tent, and all its furniture, its clasps, its boards, its bars, and its pillars, and its sockets;</verse>
  <verse number="34">and the covering of rams’ skins dyed red, and the covering of sealskins, and the veil of the screen;</verse>
  <verse number="35">the ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the mercy-seat;</verse>
  <verse number="36">the table, all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread;</verse>
  <verse number="37">the pure candlestick, the lamps thereof, even the lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the oil for the light;</verse>
  <verse number="38">and the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the screen for the door of the Tent;</verse>
  <verse number="39">the brasen altar, and its grating of brass, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base;</verse>
  <verse number="40">the hangings of the court, its pillars, and its sockets, and the screen for the gate of the court, the cords thereof, and the pins thereof, and all the instruments of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent of meeting;</verse>

  <verse number="42">According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did all the work.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And Moses saw all the work, and, behold, they had done it; as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it: and Moses blessed them.</verse>
