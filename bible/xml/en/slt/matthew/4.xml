  <verse number="1">Then was Jesus led up by the Spirit into the desert to be tried by the devil.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he was hungry.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the tempter having come to him, said, If thou art the Son of God, say that these stones should become bread.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he having answered, said, It has been written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word going forth through the mouth of God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then the devil takes him into the holy city, and sets him upon the small wing of the temple;</verse>
  <verse number="6">And says to him, If thou art the Son of God cast thyself down; for it has been written, That to his messengers he will command concerning thee; and in the hands shall they lift thee up, lest that perhaps thou strike thy foot against a stone.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Jesus said to him, Again has it been written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Again, the devil takes him into a very high mount, and shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory;</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he says to him, All these will I give to thee, if, falling down, thou wouldst worship me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then says Jesus to him, Retire, Satan; for it has been written, The Lord thy God shalt thou worship, and him alone shalt thou serve.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then the devil lets him go, and behold, the messengers came up, and they served him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Jesus having heard that John was delivered up, went back into Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And having left Nazareth behind, having come, he dwelt in Capernaum, near the sea, in the boundaries of Zabulon and Nephthalim:</verse>
  <verse number="14">That it might be completed having been spoken through Esaias the prophet, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="15">The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, the way of the sea beyond Jordan, Galilee of the nations:</verse>
  <verse number="16">The people sitting in darkness saw a great light; and to them sitting in the room and shadow of death, light has sprung up to them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">From then Jesus began to proclaim, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Jesus, walking about by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon being called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a sweep-net into the sea; for they were fishermen.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And he says to them, Come after me, and I will make you the fishermen of men.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And they instantly having let go their nets, followed him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And having proceeded thence, he saw other two brethren, James him of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the ship with Zebedee their father, adjusting their nets; and he called them.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And they having instantly let go the ship and their father, followed him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Jesus went about the whole of Galilee, teaching in their assemblies, and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom, and curing disease, and every weakness in the people.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And a report went forth of him into the whole of Syria: and they brought to him all those having injuries, being oppressed by various diseases, and trials, and being under the influence of a demon, and being lunatics, and paralytics, and he cured them.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And many crowds followed him from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond Jordan.</verse>
