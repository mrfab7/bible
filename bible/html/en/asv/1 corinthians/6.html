<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="6" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbor, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Or know ye not that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more, things that pertain to this life?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life, do ye set them to judge who are of no account in the church?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I say this to move you to shame. What, cannot there be found among you one wise man who shall be able to decide between his brethren,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">but brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And such were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up us through his power.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Or know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body? for, The twain, saith he, shall become one flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Or know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">for ye were bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your body.</p>
