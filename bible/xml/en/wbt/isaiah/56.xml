  <verse number="1">Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For thus saith the LORD to the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold of my covenant;</verse>
  <verse number="5">Even to them will I give in my house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and taketh hold of my covenant;</verse>
  <verse number="7">Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon my altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all people.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The Lord GOD who gathereth the outcasts of Israel, Yet will I gather others to him, besides those that are gathered to him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yes, all ye beasts in the forest.</verse>
  <verse number="10">His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Yes, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Come ye, say they, I will bring wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and to-morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant.</verse>
