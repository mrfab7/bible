  <verse number="1">And again he began to teach by the sea: and a great crowd was gathered together to him, so that he, having gone into the ship, sat in the sea; and all the crowd was by the sea upon land.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he taught them in parables many things, and said to them in his teaching,</verse>
  <verse number="3">Hear ye; behold, he sowing went out to sow:</verse>
  <verse number="4">And it was in sowing some truly fell by the way, and the flying things of heaven came and ate it down.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And other fell upon stony places, where it had not much earth; and quickly it sprang forth, for it had no deepness of earth:</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the sun having risen, it was parched up; and because it had no root, it was dried up.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And other fell in thorns, and the thorns came up, and choked it, and it gave no fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And other fell in good earth, and gave fruit coming up and increasing; and one brought thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he said to them, He having ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And when he was alone, they about him with the twelve asked him of the parable.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he said to them, To you has it been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to those without, all are in parables:</verse>
  <verse number="12">That seeing they might see, and not know; and hearing they might hear, and not understand; lest they turn back, and their sins be remitted to them.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he says to them, Know ye not this parable? and how will ye know all parables?</verse>
  <verse number="14">He sowing sows the word.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And these are they by the way, where the word is sown; and when they hear, quickly comes Satan, and takes away the word sown in their hearts.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And these are likewise they sown upon stony places; who, when they hear, quickly with joy receive it;</verse>
  <verse number="17">And have no root in themselves, but are temporary; then pressure having been or expulsion for the word, quickly are they scandalized.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And these are they sown in thorns; these are they hearing the word.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the cares of this time, and the deceit of riches, and eager desires about remaining things, coming in, choke the word, and it is unfruitful.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And these are they sown on good earth; who hear the word, and receive, and bear fruit, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he said to them, Much less the light comes that it be set under a bushel, or under a bed; that it be not set upon a candlestick.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For not anything is hid, which should not be manifested; neither was concealed, but that it should come clear.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And he said to them, See ye how ye hear: with what measure ye measure, shall be measured to you: and to you hearing, shall be added.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For whoever should have, to him shall be given: and whoever has not, also what he has shall be taken away from him.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed upon the earth;</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he sleep, and should rise night and day, and the seed should sprout, and be raised; how, he knows not.</verse>
  <verse number="28">For the earth bears fruit spontaneously; first the grass, then the ear, then the full wheat in the ear.</verse>
  <verse number="29">But when the fruit should yield, quickly he sends the sickle, for the harvest is brought forward.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And he said, To what should we liken the kingdom of God? or in what parable should we hold it forth?</verse>
  <verse number="31">As a kernel of mustard, which, when it be sown in the earth, is smaller than all seeds upon the earth:</verse>
  <verse number="32">And when it be sown, it comes up and is greater than all vegetables, and makes great young shoots; so that the flying things of heaven can encamp under its shadow.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And with many such parables spake he the word to them, as they were able to hear.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And without a parable spake he not to them: and apart, he solved all to his disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And he says to them in that day, being evening, Let us go beyond.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And having let the crowd go, they receive him as he was in the ship. And there were also other small vessels with him.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And there is a great hurricane of wind, and the waves struck against the ship, so that it was already filled.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And he was upon the back part of the ship, sleeping upon a pillow: and they aroused him, and say to him, Teacher, carest thou not that we perish?</verse>
  <verse number="39">And having risen, he censured the wind, and said to the sea, Be silent, be constricted. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And he said to them, Why are ye so timorous? how have ye not faith?</verse>
  <verse number="41">And they feared a great fear, and said to one another, Who is this, that also the wind and sea listen to him.</verse>
