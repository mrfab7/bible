<chapter book="Job" number="7" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Is there not a warfare to man upon earth? And are not his days like the days of a hireling?</verse>
  <verse number="2">As a servant that earnestly desireth the shadow, And as a hireling that looketh for his wages:</verse>
  <verse number="3">So am I made to possess months of misery, And wearisome nights are appointed to me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? And I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</verse>
  <verse number="5">My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; My skin closeth up, and breaketh out afresh.</verse>
  <verse number="6">My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, And are spent without hope.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Oh remember that my life is a breath: Mine eye shall no more see good.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more; Thine eyes shall be upon me, but I shall not be.</verse>
  <verse number="9">As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, So he that goeth down to Sheol shall come up no more.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He shall return no more to his house, Neither shall his place know him any more.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, That thou settest a watch over me?</verse>
  <verse number="13">When I say, My bed shall comfort me, My couch shall ease my complaint;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then thou scarest me with dreams, And terrifiest me through visions:</verse>
  <verse number="15">So that my soul chooseth strangling, And death rather than these my bones.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I loathe my life; I would not live alway: Let me alone; for my days are vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="17">What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him, And that thou shouldest set thy mind upon him,</verse>
  <verse number="18">And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, And try him every moment?</verse>
  <verse number="19">How long wilt thou not look away from me, Nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</verse>
  <verse number="20">If I have sinned, what do I unto thee, O thou watcher of men? Why hast thou set me as a mark for thee, So that I am a burden to myself?</verse>
  <verse number="21">And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? For now shall I lie down in the dust; And thou wilt seek me diligently, but I shall not be.</verse>
