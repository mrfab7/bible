<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the LORD appeared to him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell you of:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you; for to you, and to your seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I swore to Abraham your father;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I will make your seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give to your seed all these countries; and in your seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Isaac dwelled in Gerar:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look on.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is your wife; and how said you, She is my sister? And Isaac said to him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Abimelech said, What is this you have done to us? one of the people might lightly have lien with your wife, and you should have brought guiltiness on us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundred times: and the LORD blessed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For all the wells which his father’s servants had dig in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Abimelech said to Isaac, Go from us; for you are much mightier than we.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Isaac departed there, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelled there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Isaac dig again the wells of water, which they had dig in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Isaac’s servants dig in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the herdsmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And they dig another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And he removed from there, and dig another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he went up from there to Beersheba.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And the LORD appeared to him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham your father: fear not, for I am with you, and will bless you, and multiply your seed for my servant Abraham’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And he built an altar there, and called on the name of the LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants dig a well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And Isaac said to them, Why come you to me, seeing you hate me, and have sent me away from you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with you: and we said, Let there be now an oath between us, even between us and you, and let us make a covenant with you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">That you will do us no hurt, as we have not touched you, and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent you away in peace: you are now the blessed of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And they rose up betimes in the morning, and swore one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had dig, and said to him, We have found water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Which were a grief of mind to Isaac and to Rebekah.</p>
