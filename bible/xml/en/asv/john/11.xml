  <verse number="1">Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And it was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The sisters therefore sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But when Jesus heard it, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</verse>
  <verse number="6">When therefore he heard that he was sick, he abode at that time two days in the place where he was.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then after this he saith to the disciples, Let us go into Judæa again.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The disciples say unto him, Rabbi, the Jews were but now seeking to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">These things spake he: and after this he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The disciples therefore said unto him, Lord, if he is fallen asleep, he will recover.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then Jesus therefore said unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said unto his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off;</verse>
  <verse number="19">and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary still sat in the house.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Martha therefore said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And even now I know that, whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, though he die, yet shall he live;</verse>
  <verse number="26">and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die. Believest thou this?</verse>
  <verse number="27">She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I have believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, even he that cometh into the world.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is here, and calleth thee.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And she, when she heard it, arose quickly, and went unto him.</verse>
  <verse number="30">(Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met him.)</verse>
  <verse number="31">The Jews then who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going unto the tomb to weep there.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
  <verse number="33">When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,</verse>
  <verse number="34">and said, Where have ye laid him? They say unto him, Lord, come and see.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Jesus wept.</verse>
  <verse number="36">The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him!</verse>
  <verse number="37">But some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of him that was blind, have caused that this man also should not die?</verse>
  <verse number="38">Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.</verse>
  <verse number="39">Jesus saith, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time the body decayeth; for he hath been dead four days.</verse>
  <verse number="40">Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou believedst, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</verse>
  <verse number="41">So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the multitude that standeth around I said it, that they may believe that thou didst send me.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</verse>
  <verse number="44">He that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Many therefore of the Jews, who came to Mary and beheld that which he did, believed on him.</verse>
  <verse number="46">But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.</verse>
  <verse number="47">The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many signs.</verse>
  <verse number="48">If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.</verse>
  <verse number="49">But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,</verse>
  <verse number="50">nor do ye take account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</verse>
  <verse number="51">Now this he said not of himself: but, being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;</verse>
  <verse number="52">and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God that are scattered abroad.</verse>
  <verse number="53">So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death.</verse>
  <verse number="54">Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed thence into the country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there he tarried with the disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="55">Now the passover of the Jews was at hand: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, to purify themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="56">They sought therefore for Jesus, and spake one with another, as they stood in the temple, What think ye? That he will not come to the feast?</verse>
  <verse number="57">Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should show it, that they might take him.</verse>
