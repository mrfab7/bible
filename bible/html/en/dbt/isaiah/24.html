<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Behold, Jehovah maketh the land empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad its inhabitants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury, so with him from whom usury is taken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled; for Jehovah hath spoken this word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The land mourneth, it fadeth away; the world languisheth, it fadeth away: the haughty people of the land do languish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the land is polluted under the inhabitants thereof; for they have violated the laws, changed the statute, broken the everlasting covenant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Therefore doth the curse devour the earth, and they that dwell therein are held guilty; therefore the inhabitants of the earth are consumed, and few men are left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all that were merry-hearted do sigh;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">the mirth of tambours ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They do not drink wine with a song; strong drink is bitter to them that drink it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The city of solitude is broken down; every house is shut up, so that none entereth in.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened, the mirth of the land is gone;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">desolation remaineth in the city, and the gate is smitten,—a ruin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For so will it be in the midst of the land among the peoples, as the shaking of an olive-tree, as the grape-gleanings when the vintage is done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">These shall lift up their voice, they shall shout for the majesty of Jehovah, they shall cry aloud from the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Therefore glorify Jehovah in the east, the name of Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the isles of the west.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">From the end of the earth have we heard songs: Glory to the righteous! And I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! The treacherous have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous have dealt very treacherously.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Fear, and the pit, and the snare are upon thee, inhabitant of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And it shall come to pass, [that] he who fleeth from the sound of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare; for the windows on high are open, and the foundations of the earth shake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is completely dissolved, the earth is violently moved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The earth reeleth to and fro like a drunkard, and is shaken like a night hut; and its transgression is heavy upon it; and it falleth and shall not rise again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] Jehovah will punish the host of the high ones on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And they shall be brought together, [as] an assemblage of prisoners for the pit, and shall be shut up in prison, and after many days shall they be visited.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for Jehovah of hosts shall reign on mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, and before his ancients in glory.</p>
