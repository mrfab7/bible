<div class="chapter" data-book="Philippians" data-chapter="4" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wherefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Yea, I beseech thee also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Rejoice in the Lord alway: again I will say, Rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Let your forbearance be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honourable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The things which ye both learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do: and the God of peace shall be with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye have revived your thought for me; wherein ye did indeed take thought, but ye lacked opportunity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound: in everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">I can do all things in him that strengtheneth me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Howbeit ye did well, that ye had fellowship with my affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving, but ye only;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">for even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my need.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And my God shall fulfill every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now unto our God and Father be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me salute you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">All the saints salute you, especially they that are of Caesarâ€™s household.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</p>
