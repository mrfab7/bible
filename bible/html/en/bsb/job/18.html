<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“How long until you end these speeches? Show some sense, and then we can talk.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Why are we regarded as cattle, as stupid in your sight?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">You who tear yourself in anger—should the earth be forsaken on your account, or the rocks be moved from their place?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Indeed, the lamp of the wicked is extinguished; the flame of his fire does not glow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The light in his tent grows dark, and the lamp beside him goes out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">His vigorous stride is shortened, and his own schemes trip him up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For his own feet lead him into a net, and he wanders into its mesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A trap seizes his heel; a snare grips him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A noose is hidden in the ground, and a trap lies in his path.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Terrors frighten him on every side and harass his every step.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">His strength is depleted, and calamity is ready at his side.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">It devours patches of his skin; the firstborn of death devours his limbs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He is torn from the shelter of his tent and is marched off to the king of terrors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Fire resides in his tent; burning sulfur rains down on his dwelling.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The roots beneath him dry up, and the branches above him wither away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The memory of him perishes from the earth, and he has no name in the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He is driven from light into darkness and is chased from the inhabited world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He has no offspring or posterity among his people, no survivor where he once lived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Those in the west are appalled at his fate, while those in the east tremble in horror.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Surely such is the dwelling of the wicked and the place of one who does not know God.”</p>
