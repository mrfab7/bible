<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="27" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what the future day may bring.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Let another praise you, and not your own mouth: an outsider, and not your own lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A stone is weighty, and sand is burdensome; but the wrath of the foolish is heavier than both.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Anger holds no mercy, nor does fury when it erupts. And who can bear the assault of one who has been provoked?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">An open rebuke is better than hidden love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The wounds of a loved one are better than the deceitful kisses of a hateful one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">A sated soul will trample the honeycomb. And a hungry soul will accept even bitter in place of sweet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Just like a bird migrating from her nest, so also is a man who abandons his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Ointment and various perfumes delight the heart. And the good advice of a friend is sweet to the soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Do not dismiss your friend or your father’s friend. And do not enter your brother’s house in the day of your affliction. A close neighbor is better than a distant brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My son, study wisdom, and rejoice my heart, so that you may be able to respond to the one who reproaches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The discerning man, seeing evil, hides himself. The little ones, continuing on, sustain losses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Take away the garment of him who has vouched for an outsider. And take a pledge from him on behalf of foreigners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Whoever blesses his neighbor with a grand voice, rising in the night, shall be like one who curses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">A roof leaking on a cold day, and an argumentative woman, are comparable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He who would restrain her, he is like one who would grasp the wind, or who would gather together oil with his right hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Iron sharpens iron, and a man sharpens the countenance of his friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Whoever maintains the fig tree shall eat its fruit. And whoever is the keeper of his master shall be glorified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">In the manner of faces looking into shining water, so are the hearts of men made manifest to the prudent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Hell and perdition are never filled; similarly the eyes of men are insatiable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">In the manner of silver being tested in the refinery, and gold in the furnace, so also is a man tested by the mouth of one who praises. The heart of the iniquitous inquires after evils, but the heart of the righteous inquires after knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Even if you were to crush the foolish with a mortar, as when a pestle strikes over pearled barley, his foolishness would not be taken from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Be diligent to know the countenance of your cattle, and consider your own flocks,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">for you will not always hold this power. But a crown shall be awarded from generation to generation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The meadows are open, and the green plants have appeared, and the hay has been collected from the mountains.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Lambs are for your clothing, and goats are for the price of a field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Let the milk of goats be sufficient for your food, and for the necessities of your household, and for the provisions of your handmaids.</p>
