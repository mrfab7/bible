  <verse number="1">Then Job answered:</verse>
  <verse number="2">“How you have helped the powerless and saved the arm that is feeble!</verse>
  <verse number="3">How you have counseled the unwise and provided fully sound insight!</verse>
  <verse number="4">To whom have you uttered these words? And whose spirit spoke through you?</verse>
  <verse number="5">The dead tremble—those beneath the waters and those who dwell in them.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He stretches out the north over empty space; He hangs the earth upon nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He wraps up the waters in His clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their own weight.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He covers the face of the full moon, spreading over it His cloud.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He has inscribed a horizon on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The foundations of heaven quake, astounded at His rebuke.</verse>
  <verse number="12">By His power He stirred the sea; by His understanding He shattered Rahab.</verse>
  <verse number="13">By His breath the skies were cleared; His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Indeed, these are but the fringes of His ways; how faint is the whisper we hear of Him! Who then can understand the thunder of His power?”</verse>
