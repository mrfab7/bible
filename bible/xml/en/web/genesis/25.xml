  <verse number="1">Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.</verse>
  <verse number="2">She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Jokshan became the father of Sheba, and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The sons of Midian: Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac,</verse>
  <verse number="6">but to the sons of Abraham’s concubines, Abraham gave gifts. He sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, to the east country.</verse>
  <verse number="7">These are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived: one hundred seventy-five years.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Abraham gave up the spirit, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre,</verse>
  <verse number="10">the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth. Abraham was buried there with Sarah, his wife.</verse>
  <verse number="11">It happened after the death of Abraham that God blessed Isaac, his son. Isaac lived by Beer Lahai Roi.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bore to Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="13">These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to the order of their birth: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,</verse>
  <verse number="14">Mishma, Dumah, Massa,</verse>
  <verse number="15">Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.</verse>
  <verse number="16">These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments: twelve princes, according to their nations.</verse>
  <verse number="17">These are the years of the life of Ishmael: one hundred thirty-seven years. He gave up the spirit and died, and was gathered to his people.</verse>
  <verse number="18">They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you go toward Assyria. He lived opposite all his relatives.</verse>
  <verse number="19">This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham became the father of Isaac.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife, because she was barren. Yahweh was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The children struggled together within her. She said, “If it be so, why do I live?” She went to inquire of Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Yahweh said to her, “Two nations are in your womb. Two peoples will be separated from your body. The one people will be stronger than the other people. The elder will serve the younger.”</verse>
  <verse number="24">When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment. They named him Esau.</verse>
  <verse number="26">After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel. He was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.</verse>
  <verse number="27">The boys grew. Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field. Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison. Rebekah loved Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Jacob boiled stew. Esau came in from the field, and he was famished.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Esau said to Jacob, “Please feed me with that same red stew, for I am famished.” Therefore his name was called Edom.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Jacob said, “First, sell me your birthright.”</verse>
  <verse number="32">Esau said, “Behold, I am about to die. What good is the birthright to me?”</verse>
  <verse number="33">Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” He swore to him. He sold his birthright to Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils. He ate and drank, rose up, and went his way. So Esau despised his birthright.</verse>
