<chapter book="Isaiah" number="34" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Come near, ye nations, to hear, And ye peoples, give attention, Hear doth the earth and its fulness, The world, and all its productions.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For wrath is to Jehovah against all the nations, And fury against all their host, He hath devoted them to destruction, He hath given them to slaughter.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And their wounded are cast out, And their carcases cause their stench to ascend, And melted have been mountains from their blood.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And consumed have been all the host of the heavens, And rolled together as a book have been the heavens, And all their hosts do fade, As the fading of a leaf of a vine, And as the fading one of a fig-tree.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For soaked in the heavens was My sword, Lo, on Edom it cometh down, On the people of My curse for judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="6">A sword is to Jehovah—it hath been full of blood, It hath been made fat with fatness, With blood of lambs and he-goats. With fat of kidneys of rams, For a sacrifice is to Jehovah in Bozrah, And a great slaughter in the land of Edom.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And come down have reems with them, And bullocks with bulls, And soaked hath been their land from blood, And their dust from fatness is made fat.</verse>
  <verse number="8">(For a day of vengeance is to Jehovah, A year of recompences for Zion’s strife,)</verse>
  <verse number="9">And turned have been her streams to pitch, And her dust to brimstone, And her land hath become burning pitch.</verse>
  <verse number="10">By night and by day she is not quenched, To the age go up doth her smoke, From generation to generation she is waste, For ever and ever, none is passing into her.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And possess her do pelican and hedge-hog, And owl and raven dwell in her, And He hath stretched out over her A line of vacancy, and stones of emptiness.</verse>
  <verse number="12">To the kingdom her freemen they call, But there are none there, And all her princes are at an end.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And gone up her palaces have thorns, Nettle and bramble are in her fortresses, And it hath been a habitation of dragons, A court for daughters of an ostrich.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And met have Ziim with Aiim, And the goat for its companion calleth, Only there rested hath the night-owl, And hath found for herself a place of rest.</verse>
  <verse number="15">There made her nest hath the bittern, Yea, she layeth, and hath hatched, And hath gathered under her shadow, Only there gathered have been vultures, Each with its companion.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Seek out of the book of Jehovah, and read, One of these hath not been lacking, None hath missed its companion, For My mouth—it hath commanded, And His spirit—He hath gathered them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And He hath cast for them a lot, And His hand hath apportioned it to them by line, Unto the age they possess it, To all generations they dwell in it!</verse>
