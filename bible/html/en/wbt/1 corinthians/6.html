<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Do ye not know that the saints will judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more, things that pertain to this life?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that will be able to judge between his brethren?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God will destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for lewdness, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Know ye not, that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of a harlot? By no means.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">What? know ye not that he who is joined to a harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Flee lewdness. Every sin that a man doeth, is without the body; but he that committeth lewdness, sinneth against his own body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">What, know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you, which ye have from God, and ye are not your own?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are Godâ€™s.</p>
