  <verse number="1">Israel is an empty vine, he brings forth fruit to himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he has increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?</verse>
  <verse number="4">They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springs up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">It shall be also carried to Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</verse>
  <verse number="7">As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam on the water.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.</verse>
  <verse number="9">O Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loves to tread out the corn; but I passed over on her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness on you.</verse>
  <verse number="13">You have plowed wickedness, you have reaped iniquity; you have eaten the fruit of lies: because you did trust in your way, in the multitude of your mighty men.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Therefore shall a tumult arise among your people, and all your fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces on her children.</verse>
  <verse number="15">So shall Bethel do to you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.</verse>
