<div class="chapter" data-book="Galatians" data-chapter="3" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">O foolish Galatians, who did bewitch you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth crucified?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">This only would I learn from you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now perfected in the flesh?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Did ye suffer so many things in vain? if it be indeed in vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Know therefore that they that are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all the nations be blessed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">So then they that are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Now that no man is justified by the law before God, is evident: for, The righteous shall live by faith;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">and the law is not of faith; but, He that doeth them shall live in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">that upon the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: Though it be but a man’s covenant, yet when it hath been confirmed, no one maketh it void, or addeth thereto.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Now this I say: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made; and it was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now a mediator is not a mediator of one; but God is one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, verily righteousness would have been of the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But the scripture shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">So that the law is become our tutor to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But now that faith is come, we are no longer under a tutor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female; for ye all are one man in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And if ye are Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed, heirs according to promise.</p>
