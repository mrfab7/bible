  <verse number="1">If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassion,</verse>
  <verse number="2">make my joy full, by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;</verse>
  <verse number="3">doing nothing through rivalry or through conceit, but in humility, each counting others better than himself;</verse>
  <verse number="4">each of you not just looking to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Have this in your mind, which was also in Christ Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="6">who, existing in the form of God, didn’t consider equality with God a thing to be grasped,</verse>
  <verse number="7">but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And being found in human form, he humbled himself, becoming obedient to death, yes, the death of the cross.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Therefore God also highly exalted him, and gave to him the name which is above every name;</verse>
  <verse number="10">that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, those on earth, and those under the earth,</verse>
  <verse number="11">and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="12">So then, my beloved, even as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For it is God who works in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Do all things without murmurings and disputes,</verse>
  <verse number="15">that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you are seen as lights in the world,</verse>
  <verse number="16">holding up the word of life; that I may have something to boast in the day of Christ, that I didn’t run in vain nor labor in vain.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Yes, and if I am poured out on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and rejoice with you all.</verse>
  <verse number="18">In the same way, you also rejoice, and rejoice with me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered up when I know how you are doing.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For I have no one else like-minded, who will truly care about you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But you know the proof of him, that, as a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the Good News.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Therefore I hope to send him at once, as soon as I see how it will go with me.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But I trust in the Lord that I myself also will come shortly.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, fellow soldier, and your apostle and servant of my need;</verse>
  <verse number="26">since he longed for you all, and was very troubled, because you had heard that he was sick.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For indeed he was sick, nearly to death, but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow on sorrow.</verse>
  <verse number="28">I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy, and hold such in honor,</verse>
  <verse number="30">because for the work of Christ he came near to death, risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.</verse>
