  <verse number="1">But now they that are younger than I, have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Yes, to what might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age had perished?</verse>
  <verse number="3">For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their food.</verse>
  <verse number="5">They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them, as after a thief;)</verse>
  <verse number="6">To dwell in the clefts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were collected.</verse>
  <verse number="8">They were children of fools, yes, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And now I am their song, yes, I am their by-word.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.</verse>
  <verse number="13">They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.</verse>
  <verse number="14">They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.</verse>
  <verse number="18">By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He hath cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes.</verse>
  <verse number="20">I cry to thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Thou hast become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Yet he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?</verse>
  <verse number="26">When I looked for good, then evil came: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="27">My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction came upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="28">I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.</verse>
  <verse number="29">I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.</verse>
  <verse number="30">My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.</verse>
  <verse number="31">My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.</verse>
