<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Therefore setting aside all wickedness, and all artifice, and dissimulation; and envies, and all calumnies,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As new born babes, long for the sincere milk pertaining to the word, that ye might be nourished with it:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If ye have tasted that the Lord is good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To whom approaching, a living stone, truly disapproved of by men, and chosen by God, highly valued,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And ye yourselves are built, as living stones, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to bring up spiritual sacrifice; acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Wherefore also it holds in the writing, Behold, I place in Zion a corner stone, chosen, highly valued: and he believing on him shall not be ashamed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Therefore honour to you believing: and to the unbelieving, the stone which the builders disapproved of has become the head of the corner,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And a stone of stumble, and rock of offence, they disbelieving the word stumble: to which also they were set.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And ye a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for acquisition; so that ye should proclaim the excellencies of him having called you out of darkness into his wonderful light:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who once not a people, and now the people of God: they not commiserated, and now commiserated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Dearly beloved, I beseech as sojourners and strangers, to keep off from fleshly passions, which war against the soul;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Having your turning back good in the nations: that, in what they speak against you as doing evil, from good works, they having beheld, might praise God in the day of inspection.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Be subjected to every creation proceeding from man on account of the Lord: whether to the king, as having superiority;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Or to chiefs, as sent by him for the punishing of them doing evil, and the praise of them doing good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">(For so is the will of God, those doing good to silence the want of knowledge of the foolish men:)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">As free, and as not having liberty for a covering of wickedness, but as the servants of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Honour all. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Servants being subjected to masters in all fear; not only to the good and equitable, but also to the crooked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For this is grace, if any by consciousness of God bear grief, suffering unjustly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For what glory, if, sinning and being cuffed, ye endure? but if, doing good, and suffering, ye endure, this is grace with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For to this were ye called: for also Christ suffered for you, leaving behind to you an underwriting, that ye should follow upon his footsteps:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Who did no sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Who, being reviled, reviled not back; suffering, he threatened not; and delivered to him judging justly;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Who himself bear up our sins in his body upon the wood, that we, removed from sins, should live to justice: by whose bloody mark ye were healed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For ye were as sheep going astray; but now have turned about to the Shepherd and inspector of your souls.</p>
