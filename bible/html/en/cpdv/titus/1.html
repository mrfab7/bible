<div class="chapter" data-book="Titus" data-chapter="1" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, a servant of God and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, in accord with the faith of God’s elect and in acknowledgment of the truth which is accompanied by piety,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">in the hope of the eternal life that God, who does not lie, promised before the ages of time,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">which, at the proper time, he has manifested by his Word, in the preaching that has been entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">to Titus, beloved son according to the common faith. Grace and peace, from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Savior.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For this reason, I left you behind in Crete: so that those things which are lacking, you would correct, and so that you would ordain, throughout the communities, priests, (just as I also ordained you)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">if such a man is without offense, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of self-indulgence, nor of insubordination.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And a bishop, as a steward of God, must be without offense: not arrogant, not short-tempered, not a drunkard, not violent, not desiring tainted profit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">but instead: hospitable, kind, sober, just, holy, chaste,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">embracing faithful speech which is in agreement with doctrine, so that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine and to argue against those who contradict.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For there are, indeed, many who are disobedient, who speak empty words, and who deceive, especially those who are of the circumcision.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">These must be reproved, for they subvert entire houses, teaching things which should not be taught, for the favor of shameful gain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A certain one of these, a prophet of their own kind, said: “The Cretans are ever liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">This testimony is true. Because of this, rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">not paying attention to Jewish fables, nor to the rules of men who have turned themselves away from the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All things are clean to those who are clean. But to those who are defiled, and to unbelievers, nothing is clean; for both their mind and their conscience have been polluted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">They claim that they know God. But, by their own works, they deny him, since they are abominable, and unbelieving, and reprobate, toward every good work.</p>
