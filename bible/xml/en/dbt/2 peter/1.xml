  <verse number="1">Simon Peter, bondman and apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have received like precious faith with us through [the] righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Grace and peace be multiplied to you in [the] knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="3">As his divine power has given to us all things which relate to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us by glory and virtue,</verse>
  <verse number="4">through which he has given to us the greatest and precious promises, that through these ye may become partakers of [the] divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But for this very reason also, using therewith all diligence, in your faith have also virtue, in virtue knowledge,</verse>
  <verse number="6">in knowledge temperance, in temperance endurance, in endurance godliness,</verse>
  <verse number="7">in godliness brotherly love, in brotherly love love:</verse>
  <verse number="8">for these things existing and abounding in you make [you] to be neither idle nor unfruitful as regards the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="9">for he with whom these things are not present is blind, short-sighted, and has forgotten the purging of his former sins.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Wherefore the rather, brethren, use diligence to make your calling and election sure, for doing these things ye will never fall;</verse>
  <verse number="11">for thus shall the entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ be richly furnished unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Wherefore I will be careful to put you always in mind of these things, although knowing [them] and established in the present truth.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But I account it right, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting [you] in remembrance,</verse>
  <verse number="14">knowing that the putting off of my tabernacle is speedily [to take place], as also our Lord Jesus Christ has manifested to me;</verse>
  <verse number="15">but I will use diligence, that after my departure ye should have also, at any time, [in your power] to call to mind these things.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For we have not made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, following cleverly imagined fables, but having been eyewitnesses of his majesty.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For he received from God [the] Father honour and glory, such a voice being uttered to him by the excellent glory: This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight;</verse>
  <verse number="18">and this voice we heard uttered from heaven, being with him on the holy mountain.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And we have the prophetic word [made] surer, to which ye do well taking heed (as to a lamp shining in an obscure place) until [the] day dawn and [the] morning star arise in your hearts;</verse>
  <verse number="20">knowing this first, that [the scope of] no prophecy of scripture is had from its own particular interpretation,</verse>
  <verse number="21">for prophecy was not ever uttered by [the] will of man, but holy men of God spake under the power of [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
