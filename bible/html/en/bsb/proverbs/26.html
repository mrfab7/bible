<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Like snow in summer and rain at harvest, honor does not befit a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Like a fluttering sparrow or darting swallow, an undeserved curse does not come to rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the backs of fools!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Do not answer a fool according to his folly, or you yourself will be like him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he become wise in his own eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Like cutting off one’s own feet or drinking violence is the sending of a message by the hand of a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Like lame legs hanging limp is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Like binding a stone into a sling is the giving of honor to a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Like a thorn that goes into the hand of a drunkard is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Like an archer who wounds at random is he who hires a fool or passerby.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">As a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool repeats his folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The slacker says, “A lion is in the road! A fierce lion roams the public square!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">As a door turns on its hinges, so the slacker turns on his bed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The slacker buries his hand in the dish; it wearies him to bring it back to his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The slacker is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who answer discreetly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Like one who grabs a dog by the ears is a passerby who meddles in a quarrel not his own.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Like a madman shooting firebrands and deadly arrows,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">so is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, “I was only joking!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Without wood, a fire goes out; without gossip, a conflict ceases.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Like charcoal for embers and wood for fire, so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The words of a gossip are like choice morsels that go down into the inmost being.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Like glaze covering an earthen vessel are burning lips and a wicked heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">A hateful man disguises himself with his speech, but he lays up deceit in his heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">When he speaks graciously, do not believe him, for seven abominations fill his heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Though his hatred is concealed by deception, his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He who digs a pit will fall into it, and he who rolls a stone will have it roll back on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A lying tongue hates those it crushes, and a flattering mouth causes ruin.</p>
