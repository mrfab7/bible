<chapter book="Micah" number="2" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Woe to those devising iniquity, And working evil on their beds, In the light of the morning they do it, For their hand is—to God.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And they have desired fields, And they have taken violently, And houses, and they have taken away, And have oppressed a man and his house, Even a man and his inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Therefore, thus said Jehovah: Lo, I am devising against this family evil, From which ye do not remove your necks, Nor walk loftily, for a time of evil it is.</verse>
  <verse number="4">In that day doth one take up for you a simile, And he hath wailed a wailing of woe, He hath said, We have been utterly spoiled, The portion of my people He doth change, How doth He move toward me! To the backslider our fields He apportioneth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Therefore, thou hast no caster of a line by lot In the assembly of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Ye do not prophesy—they do prophesy, They do not prophesy to these, It doth not remove shame.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Doth the house of Jacob say, ‘Hath the Spirit of Jehovah been shortened? Are these His doings?’ Do not My words benefit the people that is walking uprightly?</verse>
  <verse number="8">And yesterday My people for an enemy doth raise himself up, From the outer garment the honourable ornament ye strip off, From the confident passers by, Ye who are turning back from war.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The women of My people ye cast out from its delightful house, From its sucklings ye take away My honour to the age.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Rise and go, for this is not the rest, Because of uncleanness it doth corrupt, And corruption is powerful.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If one is going with the wind, And with falsehood hath lied: ‘I prophesy to thee of wine, and of strong drink,’ He hath been the prophet of this people!</verse>
  <verse number="12">I do surely gather thee, O Jacob, all of thee, I surely bring together the remnant of Israel, Together I do set it as the flock of Bozrah, As a drove in the midst of its pasture, It maketh a noise because of man.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Gone up hath the breaker before them, They have broken through, Yea, they pass through the gate, Yea, they go out through it, And pass on doth their king before them, And Jehovah at their head!</verse>
