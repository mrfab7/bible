<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Make two trumpets of silver. You shall make them of beaten work. You shall use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">When they blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the door of the Tent of Meeting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If they blow just one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">When you blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall go forward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall go forward. They shall blow an alarm for their journeys.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">“The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. This shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">When you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets. Then you will be remembered before Yahweh your God, and you will be saved from your enemies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">“Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God. I am Yahweh your God.”</p>
