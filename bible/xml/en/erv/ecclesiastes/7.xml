<chapter book="Ecclesiastes" number="7" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">A GOOD name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one’s birth.</verse>
  <verse number="2">It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made glad.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Surely extortion maketh a wise man foolish; and a gift destroyeth the understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Wisdom is as good as an inheritance: yea, more excellent is it for them that see the sun.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For wisdom is a defence, even as money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom preserveth the life of him that hath it.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?</verse>
  <verse number="14">In the day of prosperity be joyful, and in the day of adversity consider: God hath even made the one side by side with the other, to the end that man should not find out any thing that shall be after him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">All this have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a righteous man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his evil-doing.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?</verse>
  <verse number="17">Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?</verse>
  <verse number="18">It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from that withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Wisdom is a strength to the wise man more than ten rulers which are in a city.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Also take not heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:</verse>
  <verse number="22">for oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</verse>
  <verse number="23">All this have I proved in wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.</verse>
  <verse number="24">That which is is far off, and exceeding deep; who can find it out?</verse>
  <verse number="25">I turned about, and my heart was set to know and to search out, and to seek wisdom and the reason of things, and to know that wickedness is folly, and that foolishness is madness:</verse>
  <verse number="26">And I find a thing more bitter than death, even the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Behold, this have I found, saith the Preacher; laying one thing to another, to find out the account:</verse>
  <verse number="28">which my soul still seeketh, but I have not found: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Behold, this only have I found, that God made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.</verse>
