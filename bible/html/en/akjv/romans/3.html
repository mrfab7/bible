<p class="verse" data-verse="1">What advantage then has the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Much every way: chiefly, because that to them were committed the oracles of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">God forbid: yes, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That you might be justified in your sayings, and might overcome when you are judged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who takes vengeance? (I speak as a man)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie to his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">There is none that understands, there is none that seeks after God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that does good, no, not one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Their throat is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Their feet are swift to shed blood:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Destruction and misery are in their ways:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the way of peace have they not known:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">There is no fear of God before their eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Now we know that what things soever the law said, it said to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all and on all them that believe: for there is no difference:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believes in Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yes, we establish the law.</p>
