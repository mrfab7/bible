<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every man that was wise-hearted, in whom Jehovah had put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all manner of work of the service of the sanctuary—according to all that Jehovah had commanded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every man that was wise-hearted, in whose heart God had put wisdom, every one whose heart moved him to come to the work to do it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they took from Moses every heave-offering that the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it. And they still brought him voluntary offerings morning by morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And all the wise men that wrought all the work of the sanctuary came, every man from his work which they wrought,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and spoke to Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work that Jehovah commanded to be done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed through the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the heave-offering of the sanctuary! So the people were restrained from bringing;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">for the work they had was sufficient for all the work to do it, and it was too much.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And every wise-hearted man among those that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of twined byssus, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: [with] cherubim of artistic work did he make them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The length of one curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits—one measure for all the curtains.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he coupled five of the curtains one to another, and [the other] five curtains coupled he one to another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain at the edge of the coupling; he did likewise in the edge of the outermost curtain in the other coupling.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He made fifty loops in one curtain, and he made fifty loops at the end of the curtain that was in the other coupling: the loops were opposite to one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains together with the clasps, so that the tabernacle became one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he made curtains of goats’ [hair] for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains did he make them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits the breadth of one curtain—one measure for the eleven curtains.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he coupled five of the curtains by themselves, and six of the curtains by themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he made fifty loops on the edge of the outermost curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he on the edge of the curtain in the other coupling.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he made fifty clasps of copper to couple the tent, that it might be one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And he made a covering for the tent [of] rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers’ skins above [that].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And he made the boards for the tabernacle of acacia-wood, standing up;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">ten cubits the length of the boards, and one cubit and a half the breadth of one board;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">two tenons in one board, connected one with the other: thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he made the boards for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side southward;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">and he made forty bases of silver under the twenty boards, two bases under one board, for its two tenons, and two bases under another board for its two tenons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And for the other side of the tabernacle, on the side toward the north, he made twenty boards,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">and their forty bases of silver, two bases under one board, and two bases under another board.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And at the rear of the tabernacle, westward, he made six boards;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">and he made two boards for the corners of the tabernacle at the rear;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">and they were joined beneath, and were coupled together at the top thereof into one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the corners;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">and there were eight boards, and their silver bases: sixteen bases, under every board two bases.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">—And he made bars of acacia-wood: five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle at the rear, westward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And he made the middle bar in the midst of the boards reach from one end to the other.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And he overlaid the boards with gold; and made their rings of gold [as] receptacles for the bars; and overlaid the bars with gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And he made the veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined byssus: of artistic work he made it [with] cherubim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And he made four pillars of acacia[-wood] for it, and overlaid them with gold; their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them four bases of silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And he made a curtain for the entrance of the tent of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined byssus, of embroidery;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">and its five pillars with their hooks; and he overlaid their capitals and their connecting-rods with gold; and their five bases were of copper.</p>
