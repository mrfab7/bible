  <verse number="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Can a man be profitable to God? Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that you are righteous? Or does it benefit him, that you make your ways perfect?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Is it for your piety that he reproves you, that he enters with you into judgment?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Isn’t your wickedness great? Neither is there any end to your iniquities.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For you have taken pledges from your brother for nothing, and stripped the naked of their clothing.</verse>
  <verse number="7">You haven’t given water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But as for the mighty man, he had the earth. The honorable man, he lived in it.</verse>
  <verse number="9">You have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore snares are around you. Sudden fear troubles you,</verse>
  <verse number="11">or darkness, so that you can not see, and floods of waters cover you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">“Isn’t God in the heights of heaven? See the height of the stars, how high they are!</verse>
  <verse number="13">You say, ‘What does God know? Can he judge through the thick darkness?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thick clouds are a covering to him, so that he doesn’t see. He walks on the vault of the sky.’</verse>
  <verse number="15">Will you keep the old way, which wicked men have trodden,</verse>
  <verse number="16">who were snatched away before their time, whose foundation was poured out as a stream,</verse>
  <verse number="17">who said to God, ‘Depart from us;’ and, ‘What can the Almighty do for us?’</verse>
  <verse number="18">Yet he filled their houses with good things, but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The righteous see it, and are glad. The innocent ridicule them,</verse>
  <verse number="20">saying, ‘Surely those who rose up against us are cut off. The fire has consumed their remnant.’</verse>
  <verse number="21">“Acquaint yourself with him, now, and be at peace. Thereby good shall come to you.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Please receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If you return to the Almighty, you shall be built up, if you put away unrighteousness far from your tents.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Lay your treasure in the dust, the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The Almighty will be your treasure, and precious silver to you.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, and shall lift up your face to God.</verse>
  <verse number="27">You shall make your prayer to him, and he will hear you. You shall pay your vows.</verse>
  <verse number="28">You shall also decree a thing, and it shall be established to you. Light shall shine on your ways.</verse>
  <verse number="29">When they cast down, you shall say, ‘be lifted up.’ He will save the humble person.</verse>
  <verse number="30">He will even deliver him who is not innocent. Yes, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of your hands.”</verse>
