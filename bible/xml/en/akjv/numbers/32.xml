  <verse number="1">Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;</verse>
  <verse number="2">The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="3">Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and your servants have cattle:</verse>
  <verse number="5">Why, said they, if we have found grace in your sight, let this land be given to your servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Moses said to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brothers go to war, and shall you sit here?</verse>
  <verse number="7">And why discourage you the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD has given them?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the LORD’s anger was kindled the same time, and he swore, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="11">Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:</verse>
  <verse number="12">Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the LORD’s anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And, behold, you are risen up in your fathers’ stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you shall destroy all this people.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they came near to him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:</verse>
  <verse number="17">But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="18">We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Moses said to them, If you will do this thing, if you will go armed before the LORD to war,</verse>
  <verse number="21">And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he has driven out his enemies from before him,</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward you shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Your servants will do as my lord commands.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:</verse>
  <verse number="27">But your servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord said.</verse>
  <verse number="28">So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Moses said to them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:</verse>
  <verse number="30">But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD has said to your servants, so will we do.</verse>
  <verse number="32">We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round about.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,</verse>
  <verse number="35">And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,</verse>
  <verse number="36">And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,</verse>
  <verse number="38">And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names to the cities which they built.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelled therein.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof, and called them Havothjair.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and called it Nobah, after his own name.</verse>
