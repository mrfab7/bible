<p class="verse" data-verse="1">If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath smitten him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And it shall be, that the city which is nearest unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which may neither be plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near—for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto Him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And all the elders of that city, who are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And they shall speak and say: ‘Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Forgive, O LORD, Thy people Israel, whom Thou hast redeemed, and suffer not innocent blood to remain in the midst of Thy people Israel.’ And the blood shall be forgiven them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">So shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God delivereth them into thy hands, and thou carriest them away captive,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and seest among the captives a woman of goodly form, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month; and after that thou mayest go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not deal with her as a slave, because thou hast humbled her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the first-born son be hers that was hated;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">then it shall be, in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved the first-born before the son of the hated, who is the first-born;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">but he shall acknowledge the first-born, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath; for he is the first-fruits of his strength, the right of the first-born is his.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, that will not hearken to the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and though they chasten him, will not hearken unto them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">and they shall say unto the elders of his city: ‘This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he doth not hearken to our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die; so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is a reproach unto God; that thou defile not thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.</p>
