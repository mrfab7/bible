<p class="verse" data-verse="1">In that day there shall be a fountain opened To the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, For purification and for sprinkling.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it shall come to pass in that day, Saith the LORD of hosts, That I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land, And they shall no more be remembered; And also I will cause the prophets And the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And it shall come to pass that, when any shall yet prophesy, then his father and his mother that begot him shall say unto him: ‘Thou shalt not live, for thou speakest lies in the name of the LORD’; and his father and his mother that begot him shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall be brought to shame every one through his vision, when he prophesieth; neither shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">but he shall say: ‘I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the ground; for I have been made a bondman from my youth.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And one shall say unto him: ‘What are these wounds between thy hands?’ Then he shall answer: ‘Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Awake, O sword, against My shepherd, And against the man that is near unto Me, Saith the LORD of hosts; Smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered; And I will turn My hand upon the little ones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the LORD, Two parts therein shall be cut off and die; But the third shall be left therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And I will bring the third part through the fire, And will refine them as silver is refined, And will try them as gold is tried; They shall call on My name, And I will answer them; I will say: ‘It is My people’, And they shall say: ‘The LORD is my God.’</p>
