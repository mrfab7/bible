  <verse number="1">And the days of David will draw near to die; and he will command Solomon his son, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">I go in the way of all the earth: and be thou strong, and be for a man;</verse>
  <verse number="3">And watch the watches of Jehovah thy God, to go in his ways, to watch his laws, his commands and his judgments, and his testimonies, as written in the law of Moses, so that thou shalt consider all that thou shalt do and all Where thou shalt turn there:</verse>
  <verse number="4">So that Jehovah shall raise up his word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy sons shall watch their way to go before me in truth, with all their heart, and with all their soul, saying, There shall not be cut off to thee a man from the throne of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And also thou knewest what Joab on of Zeruiah did to me, what he did to the two chiefs of the armies of Israel, to Abner son of Ner, and to Amasa son of Jether; and he will kill them and put the bloods of war in peace, and give the bloods of war upon his girdle which was upon his loins, and in his shoe upon his feet.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And do according to thy wisdom, and thou wilt not bring down his gray hairs in peace to hades.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite thou shalt do mercy, and they shall be of those eating at thy table: for so they came near to me in my fleeing from the face of Absalom thy brother.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And behold, with thee Shimei, son of Gera, a Benjamite, of Bahurim; and he cursed me a strong curse in the day I went to the two camps and he came down to my meeting at Jordan, and I will swear to him by Jehovah, saying, If I shall kill thee with the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And now thou shalt not let him go unpunished; for thou a wise man, and thou knowest what thou wilt do to him; and bring down his gray hairs with blood to hades.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And David will lie down with his fathers, and be buried in the city of David.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the days that David reigned over Israel, forty years: in Hebron he reigned seven years, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Solomon will sit upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom will be protected greatly.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Adonijah son of Haggith, will come to Bath-sheba, Solomon’s mother: and she will say, Thy coming peace? And he will say, Peace.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he will say, A word to me for thee. And she will say, Speak.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he will say, Thou knewest that to me was the kingdom, and upon me all Israel set their faces for king: and the kingdom will turn about and be for my brother, for from Jehovah it was to him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And now I ask one asking from thee, thou wilt not turn away my face. And she will say to him, Speak.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he will say, Speak now to Solomon the king, for he will not turn away thy face, and he will give to me Abishag the Shunamite for wife.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Bathsheba will say, Well I will speak for thee to the king.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Bathsheba will go to king Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king will rise up to her meeting, and worship to her, and he sat upon his throne, and a throne will be set for the king’s mother; and she will sit at his right hand.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And she will say, One small asking I ask from thee; thou wilt not turn away my face. And the king will say to her, Ask, my mother, for I will not turn away thy face.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And she will say, Give Abishag the Shunamite to Adonijah thy brother for wife.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And king Solomon will answer, and say to his mother, And wherefore didst thou ask Abishag the Shunamite for Adonijah? And ask for him the kingdom, for he my brother, the great above me; and for him Abiathar the priest, and Joab son of Zeruiah.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And king Solomon will swear by Jehovah, saying, Thus will God do to me, and thus will he add, for Adonijah spoke this word against his soul.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And now Jehovah lives who prepared me, and he will set me upon the throne of David my father, and who made for me a house as he spake, for this day Adonijah shall die.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And king Solomon will send by the hand of Benaiah, son of Jehoida, and he will strike upon him and he will die.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And to Abiathar the priest the king said, Go to Anathoth upon thy field: for thou a man of death: and in this day will not kill thee, for thou didst lift up the ark of the Lord Jehovah before David my father, and because thou wert afflicted in all which my father was afflicted.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And Solomon will drive out Abiathar from being priest to Jehovah, to complete the word of Jehovah which he spake concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the report came even to Joab: (for Joab turned after Adonijah, and after Absalom he turned not;) and Joab will flee to the tent of Jehovah and will lay hold upon the horns of the altar.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And it will be announced to king Solomon that Joab fled to the tent of Jehovah; and behold, by the altar. And Solomon will send Benaiah son of Jehoida, saying, Go strike upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And Benaiah will go to the tent of Jehovah, and say to him, Thus said the king, Come forth. And he will say, Nay; for here will I die. And Benaiah will turn back the king word, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the king will say to him, Do as he said, and strike upon him, and bury him; and take away the bloods which Joab shed gratuitously, from me and from my father’s house.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And Jehovah turned back his blood upon his head, who struck upon two just men and good above him, and he will kill them with the sword, and my father David knew not, Abner son of Ner, chief of the army of Israel, and Amasa, son of Jether, chief of the army of Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And their bloods shall turn back upon the head of Joab and upon the head of his seed forever: and to David and to his seed and to his house and to his throne shall be peace even forever, from Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Benaiah son of Jehoida will go up, and will strike upon him and will kill him: and he will be buried in his house in the desert.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the king will give Benaiah son of Jehoida instead of him over the army: and Zadok the priest, the king gave instead of Abiathar.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And the king will send and call for Shimei, and say to him, Build for thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and thou shalt not go forth from thence, whither and whither.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For being in the day of thy going forth, and thou didst pass the torrent Kidron, knowing, thou shalt know that dying, thou shalt die: thy blood shall be upon thy head.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And Shimei will say, Good the word: according to what my lord the king spake, thus will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And it will be from the end of three years, and two servants to Shimei, will flee to Achish, son of Maachah, king of Gath: and they will announce to Shimci, saying, Behold, thy servants in Gath.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And Shimei will rise and saddle his ass, and go to Gath to Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei will go and bring his servants from Gath.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And it will be announced to Solomon that Shimei went from Jerusalem to Gath, and he will turn back.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And the king will send and call for Shimei, and say to him, Did not I cause thee to swear by Jehovah, and attest to thee, saying, In the day of thy going forth, and thou wentest whither and whither, knowing, thou shalt know that dying, thou shalt die? and thou wilt say to me, Good the word I heard.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And wherefore didst thou not watch the oath of Jehovah, and the command which I commanded upon thee?</verse>
  <verse number="44">And the king will say to Shimei, Thou knewest all the evil which thy heart knew, which thou didst to David my father: and Jehovah turned back thy evil upon thy head.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And blessed be kind Solomon, and the throne of David shall be prepared before Jehovah, even forever.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And the king will command Benaiah son of Jehoida, and he will go forth and will strike upon him, and he will die. And the kingdom was prepared in the hand of Solomon.</verse>
