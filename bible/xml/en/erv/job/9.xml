  <verse number="1">Then Job answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Of a truth I know that it is so: but how can man be just with God?</verse>
  <verse number="3">If he be pleased to contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and prospered?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Which removeth the mountains, and they know it not, when he overturneth them in his anger.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Which alone stretcheth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Which maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, marvelous things without number.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Behold, he seizeth the prey, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?</verse>
  <verse number="13">God will not withdraw his anger; the helpers of Rahab do stoop under him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer; I would make supplication to mine adversary.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he hearkened unto my voice.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.</verse>
  <verse number="19">If we speak of the strength of the mighty, lo, he is there! and if of judgment, who will appoint me a time?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall condemn me: though I be perfect, it shall prove me perverse.</verse>
  <verse number="21">I am perfect; I regard not myself; I despise my life.</verse>
  <verse number="22">It is all one; therefore I say, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If the scourge slay suddenly, he will mock at the trial of the innocent.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof; if it be not he, who then is it?</verse>
  <verse number="25">Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.</verse>
  <verse number="26">They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that swoopeth on the prey.</verse>
  <verse number="27">If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer:</verse>
  <verse number="28">I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</verse>
  <verse number="29">I shall be condemned; why then do I labour in vain?</verse>
  <verse number="30">If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;</verse>
  <verse number="31">Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, that we should come together in judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="33">There is no daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his terror make me afraid:</verse>
  <verse number="35">Then would I speak, and not fear him; for I am not so in myself.</verse>
