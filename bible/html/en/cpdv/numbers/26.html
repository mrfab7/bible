<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After the blood of the guilty was shed, the Lord said to Moses, and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Number the entire sum of the sons of Israel, from twenty years and above, by their houses and kinships, all who are able to go forth to war.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And so, Moses and Eleazar the priest, who were in the plains of Moab, above the Jordan, opposite Jericho, spoke to those who were</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">from twenty years and above, just as the Lord had commanded. And this is their number:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Ruben, the firstborn of Israel; his son, Hanoch, from whom is the family of the Hanochites; and Pallu, from whom is the family of the Palluites;</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the earth, opening its mouth, devoured Korah, with many others dying, when the fire burned two hundred fifty men. And a great miracle was wrought,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">so that, when Korah perished, his sons did not perish.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="50">These are the kinships of the sons of Naphtali by their families, whose number was forty-five thousand four hundred.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">This is the sum of the sons of Israel, who were counted: six hundred thousand and one thousand seven hundred thirty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">“The land shall be divided to these, as their possessions, according to the number of their names.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">To the greater number you shall give a greater portion, and to the lesser number, a lesser portion. To each one, just as they have now been counted, a possession shall be delivered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">Yet only in so far as the land is divided by lot to a tribe and to families.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">Whatever the lot will happen to be, it shall be accepted, either by the greater, or by the lesser.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="57">Likewise, this is the number of the sons of Levi by their families: Gershon, from whom is the family of the Gershonites; Kohath, from whom is the family of the Kohathites; Merari, from whom is the family of the Merarites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="58">These are the families of Levi: The family of Libni, the family of Hebroni, the family of Mahli, the family of Mushi, the family of Korah. Yet truly, Kohath conceived Amram,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="59">who had a wife, Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who was born to him in Egypt. She bore, to her husband Amram: sons, Aaron and Moses, as well as their sister, Miriam.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="60">From Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, and Eleazar and Ithamar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="61">Of these, Nadab and Abihu died, when they had offered strange fire before the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="62">And these were all who were numbered: twenty-three thousand of the male gender, from one month and above. For they were not counted among the sons of Israel, neither was a possession given to them with the others.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="63">This is the number of the sons of Israel, who were enrolled by Moses and by Eleazar the priest, in the plains of Moab, above the Jordan, opposite Jericho.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="64">Among these, not one of them was numbered before, by Moses and Aaron in the desert of Sinai.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="65">For the Lord had foretold that all would die in the wilderness. And not one of them remained, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.</p>
