<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, bondman of Jesus Christ, [a] called apostle, separated to God’s glad tidings,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">(which he had before promised by his prophets in holy writings,)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">concerning his Son (come of David’s seed according to flesh,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">marked out Son of God in power, according to [the] Spirit of holiness, by resurrection of [the] dead) Jesus Christ our Lord;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">by whom we have received grace and apostleship in behalf of his name, for obedience of faith among all the nations,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">among whom are ye also [the] called of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">to all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and [our] Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is proclaimed in the whole world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the glad tidings of his Son, how unceasingly I make mention of you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">always beseeching at my prayers, if any way now at least I may be prospered by the will of God to come to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For I greatly desire to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to establish you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">that is, to have mutual comfort among you, each by the faith [which is] in the other, both yours and mine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, that I often proposed to come to you, (and have been hindered until the present time,) that I might have some fruit among you too, even as among the other nations also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I am a debtor both to Greeks and barbarians, both to wise and unintelligent:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">so, as far as depends on me, am I ready to announce the glad tidings to you also who [are] in Rome.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For I am not ashamed of the glad tidings; for it is God’s power to salvation, to every one that believes, both to Jew first and to Greek:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">for righteousness of God is revealed therein, on the principle of faith, to faith: according as it is written, But the just shall live by faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For there is revealed wrath of God from heaven upon all impiety, and unrighteousness of men holding the truth in unrighteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Because what is known of God is manifest among them, for God has manifested [it] to them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">—for from [the] world’s creation the invisible things of him are perceived, being apprehended by the mind through the things that are made, both his eternal power and divinity,—so as to render them inexcusable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Because, knowing God, they glorified [him] not as God, neither were thankful; but fell into folly in their thoughts, and their heart without understanding was darkened:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into [the] likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and quadrupeds and reptiles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Wherefore God gave them up [also] in the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness, to dishonour their bodies between themselves:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">who changed the truth of God into falsehood, and honoured and served the creature more than him who had created [it], who is blessed for ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For this reason God gave them up to vile lusts; for both their females changed the natural use into that contrary to nature;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">and in like manner the males also, leaving the natural use of the female, were inflamed in their lust towards one another; males with males working shame, and receiving in themselves the recompense of their error which was fit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And according as they did not think good to have God in [their] knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind to practise unseemly things;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">being filled with all unrighteousness, wickedness, covetousness, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil dispositions; whisperers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">back-biters, hateful to God, insolent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">void of understanding, faithless, without natural affection, unmerciful;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">who knowing the righteous judgment of God, that they who do such things are worthy of death, not only practise them, but have fellow delight in those who do [them].</p>
