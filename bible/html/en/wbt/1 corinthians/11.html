<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered, dishonoreth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For if the woman is not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaved, let her be covered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For the man is not from the woman, but the woman from the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head, because of the angels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Nevertheless, neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For as the woman is from the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things from God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Judge in yourselves: Is it comely that a woman should pray to God uncovered?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Doth not even nature itself teach you, that if a man hath long hair, it is a shame to him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But if a woman hath long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Now in this that I declare to you, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there are divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For there must be also heresies among you, that they who are approved may be made manifest among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">When therefore ye come together in one place, this is not to eat the Lord’s supper.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For in eating every one taketh before another his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For I have received from the Lord, that which also I delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do show the Lord’s death till he shall come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Wherefore, whoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh condemnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">But when we are judged, we are chastened by the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And if any man hungereth, let him eat at home; that ye come not together to condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.</p>
