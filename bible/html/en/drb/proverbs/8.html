<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="8" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Doth not wisdom cry aloud, and prudence put forth her voice ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Standing in the top of the highest places by the way, in the midst of the paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Beside the gates of the city, in the very doors she speaketh, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">O ye men, to you I call, and my voice is to the sons of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">O little ones, understand subtilty, and ye unwise, take notice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Hear, for I will speak of great things: and my lips shall be opened to preach right things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">All my words are just, there is nothing wicked nor perverse in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They are right to them that understand, and just to them that find knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Receive my instruction, and not money: choose knowledge rather than gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">11For wisdom is better than all the most precious things: and whatsoever may be desired cannot be compared to</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I wisdom dwell in counsel, and am present in learned thoughts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The fear of the Lord hateth evil: I hate arrogance, and pride, and every wicked way, and a mouth with a double tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Counsel and equity is mine, prudence is mine, strength is mine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">By me kings reign, and lawgivers decree just things,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">By me princes rule, and the mighty decree justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I love them that love me: and they that in the morning early watch for me, shall find me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">With me are riches and glory, glorious riches and justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For my fruit is better than gold and the precious stone, and my blossoms than choice silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I walk in the way of justice, in the midst of the paths of judgment,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">That I may enrich them that love me, and may fill their treasures.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways, before he made any thing from the beginning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">I was set up from eternity, and of old before the earth was made.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The depths were not as yet, and I was already conceived. neither had the fountains of waters as yet sprung out:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The mountains with their huge bulk had not as yet been established: before the hills I was brought forth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He had not yet made the earth, nor the rivers, nor the poles of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">When he prepared the heavens, I was present: when with a certain law and compass he enclosed the depths:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">When he established the sky above, and poised the fountains of waters:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">When he compassed the sea with its bounds, and set a law to the waters that they should not pass their limits: when be balanced the foundations of the earth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">I was with him forming all things: and was delighted every day, playing before him at all times;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Playing in the world: and my delights were to be with the children of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Now therefore, ye children, hear me: Blessed are they that keep my ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Hear instruction and be wise, and refuse it not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Blessed is the man that heareth me, and that watcheth daily at my gates, and waiteth at the posts of my doors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">He that shall find me, shall find life, and shall have salvation from the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">But he that shall sin against me, shall hurt his own soul. All that hate me love death.</p>
