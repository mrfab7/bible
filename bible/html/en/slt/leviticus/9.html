<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And Moses will say to Aaron, Draw near to the altar and do thy sin, and thy burnt-offering, and expiate for thyself, and for the people: and do the offering of the people, and expiate for them; as Jehovah commanded.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he will slaughter the bullock, and the ram of the sacrifice of peace, which is for the people: and the sons of Aaron will bring the blood to him, and he will sprinkle it upon the altar round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the fat from the bullock, and from the ram, the fat tail and the covering, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And they will put the fat upon the breasts, and he will burn the fat upon the altar.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Aaron will lift up his hand to the people, and bless them; and come down from the doing the sin, and the burnt-offering, and the peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Moses will go in, and Aaron, to the tent of appointment, and they will come forth and they will bless the people: and the glory of Jehovah will be seen to all the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And fire will come forth from before Jehovah, and will consume upon the altar the burnt-offering, and the fat: and they will shout and fall upon their faces.</p>
