<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="5" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Above all else, it is being said that there is fornication among you, even fornication of a such kind that is not among the Gentiles, so that someone would have the wife of his father.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And yet you are inflated, and you have not instead been grieved, so that he who has done this thing would be taken away from your midst.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Certainly, though absent in body, I am present in spirit. Thus, I have already judged, as if I were present, him who has done this.</verse>
  <verse number="4">In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you have been gathered together with my spirit, in the power of our Lord Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="5">to hand over such a one as this to Satan, for the destruction of the flesh, so that the spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="6">It is not good for you to glory. Do you not know that a little leaven corrupts the entire mass?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Purge the old leaven, so that you may become the new bread, for you are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover, has now been immolated.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And so, let us feast, not with the old leaven, not with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">As I have written to you in an epistle: “Do not associate with fornicators,”</verse>
  <verse number="10">certainly not with the fornicators of this world, nor with the greedy, nor with robbers, nor with the servants of idolatry. Otherwise, you ought to depart from this world.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But now I have written to you: do not associate with anyone who is called a brother and yet is a fornicator, or greedy, or a servant of idolatry, or a slanderer, or inebriated, or a robber. With such a one as this, do not even take food.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For what have I to do with judging those who are outside? But do not even you yourselves judge those who are inside?</verse>
  <verse number="13">For those who are outside, God will judge. But send this evil person away from yourselves.</verse>
