<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man with the help of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And again she bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">but unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance fallen?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother’s keeper?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood crieth unto me from the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And now cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">when thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a wanderer shalt thou be in the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the ground; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth; and it shall come to pass, that whosoever findeth me shall slay me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD appointed a sign for Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and Mehujael begat Methushael: and Methushael begat Lamech.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Zillah, she also bare Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Lamech said unto his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: For I have slain a man for wounding me, And a young man for bruising me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, Truly Lamech seventy and sevenfold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called his name Seth: For, said she, God hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel; for Cain slew him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enosh: then began men to call upon the name of the LORD.</p>
