<chapter book="Matthew" number="25" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.</verse>
  <verse number="3">They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</verse>
  <verse number="4">But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</verse>
  <verse number="5">While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom comes; go you out to meet him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the foolish said to the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go you rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But he answered and said, Truly I say to you, I know you not.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man comes.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered to them his goods.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But he that had received one went and dig in the earth, and hid his lord’s money.</verse>
  <verse number="19">After a long time the lord of those servants comes, and reckons with them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, you delivered to me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</verse>
  <verse number="21">His lord said to him, Well done, you good and faithful servant: you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, you delivered to me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</verse>
  <verse number="23">His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew you that you are an hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not strewed:</verse>
  <verse number="25">And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the earth: see, there you have that is yours.</verse>
  <verse number="26">His lord answered and said to him, You wicked and slothful servant, you knew that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strewed:</verse>
  <verse number="27">You ought therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received my own with usury.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him which has ten talents.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For to every one that has shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that has not shall be taken away even that which he has.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And cast you the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="31">When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:</verse>
  <verse number="32">And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats:</verse>
  <verse number="33">And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Then shall the King say to them on his right hand, Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</verse>
  <verse number="35">For I was an hungered, and you gave me meat: I was thirsty, and you gave me drink: I was a stranger, and you took me in:</verse>
  <verse number="36">Naked, and you clothed me: I was sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came to me.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we you an hungered, and fed you? or thirsty, and gave you drink?</verse>
  <verse number="38">When saw we you a stranger, and took you in? or naked, and clothed you?</verse>
  <verse number="39">Or when saw we you sick, or in prison, and came to you?</verse>
  <verse number="40">And the King shall answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you have done it to one of the least of these my brothers, you have done it to me.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Then shall he say also to them on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</verse>
  <verse number="42">For I was an hungered, and you gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink:</verse>
  <verse number="43">I was a stranger, and you took me not in: naked, and you clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and you visited me not.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we you an hungered, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to you?</verse>
  <verse number="45">Then shall he answer them, saying, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not to me.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</verse>
