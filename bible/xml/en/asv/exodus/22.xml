  <verse number="25">If thou lend money to any of my people with thee that is poor, thou shalt not be to him as a creditor; neither shall ye lay upon him interest.</verse>
  <verse number="26">If thou at all take thy neighbor’s garment to pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him before the sun goeth down:</verse>
  <verse number="27">for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Thou shalt not revile God, nor curse a ruler of thy people.</verse>
