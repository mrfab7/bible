  <verse number="1">Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Also, you son of man, thus said the Lord GOD to the land of Israel; An end, the end is come on the four corners of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Now is the end come on you, and I will send my anger on you, and will judge you according to your ways, and will recompense on you all your abominations.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And my eye shall not spare you, neither will I have pity: but I will recompense your ways on you, and your abominations shall be in the middle of you: and you shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thus said the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.</verse>
  <verse number="6">An end is come, the end is come: it watches for you; behold, it is come.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The morning is come to you, O you that dwell in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now will I shortly pour out my fury on you, and accomplish my anger on you: and I will judge you according to your ways, and will recompense you for all your abominations.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense you according to your ways and your abominations that are in the middle of you; and you shall know that I am the LORD that smites.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod has blossomed, pride has budded.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither shall there be wailing for them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The time is come, the day draws near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is on all the multitude thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, which shall not return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.</verse>
  <verse number="14">They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goes to the battle: for my wrath is on all the multitude thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="17">All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.</verse>
  <verse number="18">They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be on all faces, and baldness on all their heads.</verse>
  <verse number="19">They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD: they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it is the stumbling block of their iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="20">As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations and of their detestable things therein: therefore have I set it far from them.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.</verse>
  <verse number="22">My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place: for the robbers shall enter into it, and defile it.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Why I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pomp of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be defiled.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Destruction comes; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Mischief shall come on mischief, and rumor shall be on rumor; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.</verse>
  <verse number="27">The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do to them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
