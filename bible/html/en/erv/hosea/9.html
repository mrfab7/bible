<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, like the peoples; for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved hire upon every cornfloor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The threshing-floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They shall not dwell in the LORD’S land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean food in Assyria.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They shall not pour out wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be polluted: for their bread shall be for their appetite; it shall not come into the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">What will ye do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For, lo, they are gone away from destruction, yet Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: their pleasant things of silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be in their tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the man that hath the spirit is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and because the enmity is great.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Ephraim was a watchman with my God: as for the prophet, a fowler’s snare is in all his ways, and enmity in the house of his God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first season: but they came to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves unto the shameful thing, and became abominable like that which they loved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird: there shall be no birth, and none with child, and no conception.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there be not a man left: yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Ephraim, like as I have seen Tyre, is planted in a pleasant place: but Ephraim shall bring out his children to the slayer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them: because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine house: I will love them no more; all their princes are revolters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.</p>
