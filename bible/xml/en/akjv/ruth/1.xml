<chapter book="Ruth" number="1" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Elimelech Naomi’s husband died; and she was left, and her two sons.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there about ten years.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was left of her two sons and her husband.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Why she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Naomi said to her two daughters in law, Go, return each to her mother’s house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as you have dealt with the dead, and with me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The LORD grant you that you may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice, and wept.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they said to her, Surely we will return with you to your people.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will you go with me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;</verse>
  <verse number="13">Would you tarry for them till they were grown? would you stay for them from having husbands? no, my daughters; for it grieves me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed her mother in law; but Ruth joined to her.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And she said, Behold, your sister in law is gone back to her people, and to her gods: return you after your sister in law.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave you, or to return from following after you: for where you go, I will go; and where you lodge, I will lodge: your people shall be my people, and your God my God:</verse>
  <verse number="17">Where you die, will I die, and there will I be buried: the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part you and me.</verse>
  <verse number="18">When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, then she left speaking to her.</verse>
  <verse number="19">So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?</verse>
  <verse number="20">And she said to them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">I went out full and the LORD has brought me home again empty: why then call you me Naomi, seeing the LORD has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?</verse>
  <verse number="22">So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.</verse>
