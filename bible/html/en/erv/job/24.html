<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Why are times not laid up by the Almighty? and why do not they which know him see his days?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">There are that remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widowâ€™s ox for a pledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Behold, as wild asses in the desert they go forth to their work, seeking diligently for meat; the wilderness yieldeth them food for their children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">They cut their provender in the field; and they glean the vintage of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They lie all night naked without clothing, and have no covering in the cold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">So that they go about naked without clothing, and being an-hungred they carry the sheaves;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They make oil within the walls of these men; they tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">From out of the populous city men groan, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God imputeth it not for folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">These are of them that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The murderer riseth with the light, he killeth the poor and needy; and in the night he is as a thief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and he disguiseth his face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">In the dark they dig through houses: they shut themselves up in the daytime; they know not the light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the morning is to all of them as the shadow of death; for they know the terrors of the shadow of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He is swift upon the face of the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he turneth not by the way of the vineyards.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth Sheol those which have sinned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered: and unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He devoureth the barren that beareth not; and doeth not good to the widow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He draweth away the mighty also by his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">God giveth them to be in security, and they rest thereon; and his eyes are upon their ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone; yea, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all other, and are cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?</p>
