  <verse number="1">And Bezaleel made, and Aholiab, and every man wise of heart, to whom Jehovah gave wisdom and understanding in them to know to do all the work of service of the holy place according to all which Jehovah commanded.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Moses will call to Bezaleel and to Aholiab, and to every man wise of heart, to whom Jehovah gave wisdom in his heart, every one who lifted up his heart to draw near to the work to do it:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And they will take from before Moses all the offering which the sons of Israel brought for the work of the service of the holy place to do it. And they brought to him yet a voluntary gift in the morning by morning.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And all the wise will come, doing the work of the holy place; a man a man from his work which they were doing.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And they will say to Moses, saying, The people are multiplying to bring more than enough to the service for the work which Jehovah commanded to do it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Moses will command, and they will make a voice pass through in the camp, saying, A man and woman shall do no more work for the offering of the holy place. And the people will withhold from bringing.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the work was enough for all the work to do it, and more than enough.</verse>

  <verse number="16">And he will join five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.</verse>

  <verse number="21">Ten cubits the length of the board, and a cubit and a half a cubit, the breadth of the one board.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Two hands to the one board, joined together one to the one: thus he made for all the boards of the temple.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he will make boards for the temple, twenty boards for the south side southward.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And forty bases of silver, he made the twenty boards; two bases under the one board, for its two hands, and two bases under one board for its two hands.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And for the second rib of the temple for the north side, he made twenty boards,</verse>
  <verse number="26">And their forty bases of silver; two bases under the one board, and two bases under the one board.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And for the hinder parts of the temple to the sea he made six boards.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And two boards he made for the angles of the temple in the hinder parts.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And they were double from beneath, and they will be joined, they will be complete at its head to the one ring; thus he did to two of them for the two angles.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And there were eight boards; and their bases of silver, sixteen bases; two bases, two bases under the one board.</verse>

  <verse number="32">And five bars for the second rib of the temple, and five bars for the boards of the temple, for the hinder parts to the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And he made the middle bar to pass through in the midst of the boards from the end to the end.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And he spread over the boards with gold, and he made their rings of gold, the inner parts for the bars, and he will spread over the bars with gold.</verse>
