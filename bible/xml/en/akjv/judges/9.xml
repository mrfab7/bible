  <verse number="1">And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother’s brothers, and communed with them, and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are three score and ten persons, reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And his mother’s brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they gave him three score and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baalberith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light persons, which followed him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he went to his father’s house at Ophrah, and slew his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, being three score and ten persons, on one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said to them, Listen to me, you men of Shechem, that God may listen to you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and they said to the olive tree, Reign you over us.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But the olive tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness, with which by me they honor God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the trees said to the fig tree, Come you, and reign over us.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But the fig tree said to them, Should I forsake my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Then said the trees to the vine, Come you, and reign over us.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the vine said to them, Should I leave my wine, which cheers God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then said all the trees to the bramble, Come you, and reign over us.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the bramble said to the trees, If in truth you anoint me king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Now therefore, if you have done truly and sincerely, in that you have made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deserving of his hands;</verse>
  <verse number="17">(For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:</verse>
  <verse number="18">And you are risen up against my father’s house this day, and have slain his sons, three score and ten persons, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)</verse>
  <verse number="19">If you then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice you in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you:</verse>
  <verse number="20">But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelled there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="22">When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:</verse>
  <verse number="24">That the cruelty done to the three score and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid on Abimelech their brother, which slew them; and on the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his brothers.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them: and it was told Abimelech.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers, and went over to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards, and stepped the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?</verse>
  <verse number="29">And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase your army, and come out.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And he sent messengers to Abimelech privately, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers be come to Shechem; and, behold, they fortify the city against you.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Now therefore up by night, you and the people that is with you, and lie in wait in the field:</verse>
  <verse number="33">And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, you shall rise early, and set on the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come out against you, then may you do to them as you shall find occasion.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were with him, from lying in wait.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said to him, You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And Gaal spoke again, and said, See there come people down by the middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of Meonenim.</verse>
  <verse number="38">Then said Zebul to him, Where is now your mouth, with which you said, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the people that you have despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with them.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even to the entering of the gate.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And Abimelech dwelled at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brothers, that they should not dwell in Shechem.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field; and they told Abimelech.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote them.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other companies ran on all the people that were in the fields, and slew them.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And Abimelech got him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an ax in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder, and said to the people that were with him, What you have seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done.</verse>
  <verse number="49">And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire on them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.</verse>
  <verse number="50">Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.</verse>
  <verse number="51">But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them, and got them up to the top of the tower.</verse>
  <verse number="52">And Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and went hard to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.</verse>
  <verse number="53">And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone on Abimelech’s head, and all to broke his skull.</verse>
  <verse number="54">Then he called hastily to the young man his armor bearer, and said to him, Draw your sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.</verse>
  <verse number="55">And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place.</verse>
  <verse number="56">Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in slaying his seventy brothers:</verse>
  <verse number="57">And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render on their heads: and on them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.</verse>
