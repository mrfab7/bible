<chapter book="Song of Solomon" number="6" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Where is your beloved gone, O you fairest among women? where is your beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with you.</verse>
  <verse number="2">My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine: he feeds among the lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="4">You are beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Turn away your eyes from me, for they have overcome me: your hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Your teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one bears twins, and there is not one barren among them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">As a piece of a pomegranate are your temples within your locks.</verse>
  <verse number="8">There are three score queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.</verse>
  <verse number="9">My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yes, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Who is she that looks forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?</verse>
  <verse number="11">I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look on you. What will you see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.</verse>
