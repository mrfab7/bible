<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Remember, O Jehovah, what is come upon us: Behold, and see our reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Our inheritance is turned unto strangers, Our houses unto aliens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">We are orphans and fatherless; Our mothers are as widows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">We have drunken our water for money; Our wood is sold unto us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Our pursuers are upon our necks: We are weary, and have no rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">We have given the hand to the Egyptians, And to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Our fathers sinned, and are not; And we have borne their iniquities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Servants rule over us: There is none to deliver us out of their hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">We get our bread at the peril of our lives, Because of the sword of the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Our skin is black like an oven, Because of the burning heat of famine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They ravished the women in Zion, The virgins in the cities of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Princes were hanged up by their hand: The faces of elders were not honored.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The young men bare the mill; And the children stumbled under the wood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The elders have ceased from the gate, The young men from their music.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The joy of our heart is ceased; Our dance is turned into mourning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The crown is fallen from our head: Woe unto us! for we have sinned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For this our heart is faint; For these things our eyes are dim;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For the mountain of Zion, which is desolate: The foxes walk upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thou, O Jehovah, abidest for ever; Thy throne is from generation to generation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, And forsake us so long time?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Turn thou us unto thee, O Jehovah, and we shall be turned; Renew our days as of old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But thou hast utterly rejected us; Thou art very wroth against us.</p>
