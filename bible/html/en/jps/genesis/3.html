<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman: ‘Yea, hath God said: Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the woman said unto the serpent: ‘Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said: Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the serpent said unto the woman: ‘Ye shall not surely die;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat; and she gave also unto her husband with her, and he did eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig-leaves together, and made themselves girdles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden toward the cool of the day; and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the LORD God called unto the man, and said unto him: ‘Where art thou?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he said: ‘I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And He said: ‘Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the man said: ‘The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the LORD God said unto the woman: ‘What is this thou hast done?’ And the woman said: ‘The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And the LORD God said unto the serpent: ‘Because thou hast done this, cursed art thou from among all cattle, and from among all beasts of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; they shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise their heel.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Unto the woman He said: ‘I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy travail; in pain thou shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And unto Adam He said: ‘Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying: Thou shalt not eat of it; cursed is the ground for thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the man called his wife’s name Eve; because she was the mother of all living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the LORD God said: ‘Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">So He drove out the man; and He placed at the east of the garden of Eden the cherubim, and the flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way to the tree of life.</p>
