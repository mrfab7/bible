  <verse number="1">AND he said to his disciples: It is impossible that scandals should not come: but woe to him through whom they come.</verse>
  <verse number="2">It were better for him, that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should scandalize one of these little ones.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Take heed to yourselves. If thy brother sin against thee, reprove him: and if he do penance, forgive him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And if he sin against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day be converted unto thee, saying, I repent; forgive him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the apostles said to the Lord: Increase our faith.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the Lord said: If you had faith like to a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this mulberry tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou transplanted into the sea: and it would obey you.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But which of you having a servant ploughing, or feeding cattle, will say to him, when he is come from the field: Immediately go, sit down to meat:</verse>
  <verse number="8">And will not rather say to him: Make ready my supper, and gird thyself, and serve me, whilst I eat and drink, and afterwards thou shalt eat and drink?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Doth he thank that servant, for doing the things which he commanded him?</verse>
  <verse number="10">I think not. So you also, when you shall have done all these things that are commanded you, say: We are unprofitable servants; we have done that which we ought to do.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it came to pass, as he was going to Jerusalem, he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And as he entered into a certain town, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off;</verse>
  <verse number="13">And lifted up their voice, saying: Jesus, master, have mercy on us.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Whom when he saw, he said: Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, as they went, they were made clean.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And one of them, when he saw that he was made clean, went back, with a loud voice glorifying God.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he fell on his face before his feet, giving thanks: and this was a Samaritan.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Jesus answering, said, Were not ten made clean? and where are the nine?</verse>
  <verse number="18">There is no one found to return and give glory to God, but this stranger.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And he said to him: Arise, go thy way; for thy faith hath made thee whole.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And being asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come? he answered them, and said: The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:</verse>
  <verse number="21">Neither shall they say: Behold here, or behold there. For lo, the kingdom of God is within you.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he said to his disciples: The days will come, when you shall desire to see one day of the Son of man; and you shall not see it.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they will say to you: See here, and see there. Go ye not after, nor follow them:</verse>
  <verse number="24">For as the lightening that lighteneth from under heaven, shineth unto the parts that are under heaven, so shall the Son of man be in his day.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And as it came to pass in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.</verse>
  <verse number="27">They did eat and drink, they married wives, and were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark: and the flood came and destroyed them all.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Likewise as it came to pass, in the days of Lot: they did eat and drink, they bought and sold, they planted and built.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And in the day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man shall be revealed.</verse>
  <verse number="31">In that hour, he that shall be on the housetop, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and he that shall be in the field, in like manner, let him not return back.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Remember Lot’s wife.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Whosoever shall seek to save his life, shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose it, shall preserve it.</verse>
  <verse number="34">I say to you: in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Two women shall be grinding together: the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left: two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be keft.</verse>
  <verse number="36">They answering, say to him: Where, Lord?</verse>
  <verse number="37">Who said to them: Wheresoever the body shall be, thither will the eagles also be gathered together.</verse>
