<p class="verse" data-verse="1">How the gold has become tarnished, the pure gold has become dull! The gems of the temple lie scattered on every street corner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How the precious sons of Zion, once worth their weight in pure gold, are now esteemed as jars of clay, the work of a potter’s hands!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Even jackals offer their breasts to nurse their young, but the daughter of my people has become cruel, like an ostrich in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The nursing infant’s tongue clings in thirst to the roof of his mouth. Little children beg for bread, but no one gives them any.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Those who once ate delicacies are destitute in the streets; those brought up in crimson huddle in ash heaps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The punishment of the daughter of my people is greater than that of Sodom, which was overthrown in an instant without a hand turned to help her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Her dignitaries were brighter than snow, whiter than milk; their bodies were more ruddy than rubies, their appearance like sapphires.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But now their appearance is blacker than soot; they are not recognized in the streets. Their skin has shriveled on their bones; it has become as dry as a stick.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Those slain by the sword are better off than those who die of hunger, who waste away, pierced with pain because the fields lack produce.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The hands of compassionate women have cooked their own children, who became their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The LORD has exhausted His wrath; He has poured out His fierce anger; He has kindled a fire in Zion, and it has consumed her foundations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The kings of the earth did not believe, nor any people of the world, that an enemy or a foe could enter the gates of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But this was for the sins of her prophets and the guilt of her priests, who shed the blood of the righteous in her midst.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">They wandered blind in the streets, defiled by this blood, so that no one dared to touch their garments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">“Go away! Unclean!” men shouted at them. “Away, away! Do not touch us!” So they fled and wandered. Among the nations it was said, “They can stay here no longer.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The presence of the LORD has scattered them; He regards them no more. The priests are shown no honor; the elders find no favor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">All the while our eyes were failing as we looked in vain for help. We watched from our towers for a nation that could not save us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">They stalked our every step, so that we could not walk in our streets. Our end drew near, our time ran out, for our end had come!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Those who chased us were swifter than the eagles in the sky; they pursued us over the mountains and ambushed us in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The LORD’s anointed, the breath of our life, was captured in their pits. We had said of him, “Under his shadow we will live among the nations.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">So rejoice and be glad, O Daughter of Edom, you who dwell in the land of Uz. Yet the cup will pass to you as well; you will get drunk and expose yourself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">O Daughter of Zion, your punishment is complete; He will not prolong your exile. But He will punish your iniquity, O Daughter of Edom; He will expose your sins.</p>
