  <verse number="1">Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly.</verse>
  <verse number="2">We all stumble in many ways. If anyone is never at fault in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to control his whole body.</verse>
  <verse number="3">When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can guide the whole animal.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Consider ships as well. Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot is inclined.</verse>
  <verse number="5">In the same way, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it boasts of great things. Consider how small a spark sets a great forest ablaze.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The tongue also is a fire, a world of wickedness among the parts of the body. It pollutes the whole person, sets the course of his life on fire, and is itself set on fire by hell.</verse>
  <verse number="7">All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been tamed by man,</verse>
  <verse number="8">but no man can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</verse>
  <verse number="9">With the tongue we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in God’s likeness.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, this should not be!</verse>
  <verse number="11">Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring?</verse>
  <verse number="12">My brothers, can a fig tree grow olives, or a grapevine bear figs? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show it by his good conduct, by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But if you harbor bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast in it or deny the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Such wisdom does not come from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every evil practice.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But the wisdom from above is first of all pure, then peace-loving, gentle, accommodating, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial, and sincere.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Peacemakers who sow in peace reap the fruit of righteousness.</verse>
