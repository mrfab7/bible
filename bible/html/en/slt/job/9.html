<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="9" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job will answer and say,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I knew that so the truth: and how shall man be just with God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If he shall desire to contend with him, he shall not answer him one from a thousand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Wise of heart and strong of power: who was hard before him and shall be requited?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Removing the mountains and they knew not: who overturned them in his anger;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Moving the earth from her place, and her pillars will tremble;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Saying to the sun, and it shall not rise; and for the stars he will seal them up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He alone spread out the heavens and he trod upon the heights of the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He made Ash-Chesil and Cimah, and the chambers of the south;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He did great things even not searched out; and wonders even no number.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Behold, he will pass by me, and I shall not see: and he will glide on and I shall not understand for him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Behold, he will catch and who shall turn him? and who shall say to him, What wilt thou do?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">God will not turn back his anger, the helpers of pride bowed down under him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">How much less shall I answer him, shall I choose my words with him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Whom, if I was just, I shall not answer; I will make supplication to my judge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If I called and he will answer me, I shall not believe that he will give ear to my voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Who will assail me with tempest, and he multiplied my wounds without cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He will not give me to draw in my spirit, for he will fill me with bitterness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If for strength, behold him strong: if for judgment, who shall arraign me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">If I shall be just, my mouth shall condemn me: I am blameless, and he will declare me perverse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">I am blameless, I shall not know my soul: I shall despise my life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">It is one: for this, I said, The blameless one and the unjust one he finishes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If the scourge shall fall suddenly, he will deride at the trial of the innocent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The earth was given into the hand of the unjust one: he will cover the faces of her judges; if not now, who is it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">My days were swift above a runner: they fled, they saw not good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">They glided along with the ships of desire: as the eagle will pounce upon food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">If my saying, I will forget my complaint, I will let go my face, and I will be cheerful:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">I was afraid of all my pains, I knew that thou wilt not acquit me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Shall I do evil, wherefore this shall I labor in vain?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">If I washed myself in snow-water, and cleansed my hands clean;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Then thou wilt immerse me in the ditch, and my garments abhorred me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For not a man as I; I shall answer him, we shall come together in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">There is not between us a reprover; he will put his hand upon us two.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">He will take away his rod from me, and his truth shall not make me afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">I will speak, and I shall not fear him; but not so am I with myself.</p>
