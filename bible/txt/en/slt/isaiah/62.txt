1	For sake of Zion I will not be silent, and for sake of Jerusalem I will not rest till its justice shall go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a flame shall burn.
2	And the nations shall see thy justice, and all kings thy glory: and a new name shall be called to thee which the mouth of Jehovah shall name it.
3	And thou wert a crown of glory in the hand of Jehovah, and a tiara of royalty in the hand of thy God.
4	It shall no more be said to thee, Forsaken; and to thy land it shall no more be said, Desolation; for it shall be called to thee, My delight in her, and to thy land, Married: for Jehovah delighted in thee, and thy land shall be married.
5	As a young man will marry a virgin, thy sons shall marry thee: and the bridegroom rejoicing over the bride, thy God will rejoice over thee.
6	I appointed those watching over thy walls, O Jerusalem: all the day and all the night continually they shall not be silent: ye remembering Jehovah, no stillness to you.
7	And ye shall not give rest to him till he shall prepare, and till he shall set Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
8	Jehovah sware by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, If I shall give more thy grain for food to thine enemies, and if the sons of the stranger shall drink thy new wine which thou didst labor for it:
9	For they gathering it shall eat it, and praise Jehovah; and they collecting it shall drink it in the enclosures of my holy place.
10	Pass through, pass through in the gates; clear ye the way of the people; lift up, lift up the highway; free it from stone; raise up a signal for the peoples.
11	Behold, Jehovah caused to be heard to the extremity of the earth, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation coming: behold, his reward with him, and his work before his face.
12	And they called to them, The holy people, redeemed of Jehovah: and it shall be called to thee, A city sought for: not forsaken.
