  <verse number="1">My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I will say to God, Do not condemn me; show me why thou contendest with me.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Is it good to thee that thou shouldst oppress, that thou shouldst despise the work of thy hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man’s days,</verse>
  <verse number="6">That thou inquirest after my iniquity, and searchest after my sin?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thy hand.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thy hands have made me and fashioned me in all my parts; yet thou dost destroy me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Thou hast granted me life and favor, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And these things hast thou hid in thy heart: I know that this is with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="14">If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from my iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="15">If I be wicked, woe to me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou my affliction;</verse>
  <verse number="16">For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou showest thyself wonderful upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thy indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Why then hast thou brought me forth from the womb? O that I had expired, and no eye had seen me!</verse>
  <verse number="19">I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,</verse>
  <verse number="21">Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness, and the shades of death;</verse>
  <verse number="22">A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shades of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.</verse>
