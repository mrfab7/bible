<chapter book="Job" number="34" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Then Elihu continued:</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Hear my words, O wise men; give ear to me, O men of learning.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the ear tests words as the mouth tastes food.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Let us choose for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For Job has declared, ‘I am righteous, yet God has deprived me of justice.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Would I lie about my case? My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.’</verse>
  <verse number="7">What man is like Job, who drinks up derision like water?</verse>
  <verse number="8">He keeps company with evildoers and walks with wicked men.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing that he should delight in God.’</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore listen to me, O men of understanding. Far be it from God to do wrong, and from the Almighty to act unjustly.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For according to a man’s deeds He repays him; according to a man’s ways He brings consequences.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Indeed, it is true that God does not act wickedly, and the Almighty does not pervert justice.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who gave Him charge over the earth? Who appointed Him over the whole world?</verse>
  <verse number="14">If He were to set His heart to it and withdraw His Spirit and breath,</verse>
  <verse number="15">all flesh would perish together and mankind would return to the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If you have understanding, hear this; listen to my words.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Could one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn the just and mighty One,</verse>
  <verse number="18">who says to kings, ‘You are worthless!’ and to nobles, ‘You are wicked,’</verse>
  <verse number="19">who is not partial to princes and does not favor rich over poor? For they are all the work of His hands.</verse>
  <verse number="20">They die in an instant, in the middle of the night. The people convulse and pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For His eyes are on the ways of a man, and He sees his every step.</verse>
  <verse number="22">There is no darkness or deep shadow where the workers of iniquity can hide.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For God need not examine a man further or have him approach for judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He shatters the mighty without inquiry and sets up others in their place.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Therefore, He recognizes their deeds; He overthrows them in the night and they are crushed.</verse>
  <verse number="26">He strikes them for their wickedness in full view,</verse>
  <verse number="27">because they turned aside from Him and had no regard for any of His ways.</verse>
  <verse number="28">They caused the cry of the poor to come before Him, and He heard the outcry of the afflicted.</verse>
  <verse number="29">But when He remains silent, who can condemn Him? When He hides His face, who can see Him? Yet He watches over both man and nation,</verse>
  <verse number="30">that godless men should not rule or lay snares for the people.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Suppose someone says to God, ‘I have endured my punishment; I will offend no more.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Teach me what I cannot see; if I have done wrong, I will not do it again.’</verse>
  <verse number="33">Should God repay you on your own terms when you have disavowed Him? You must choose, not I; so tell me what you know.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Men of understanding will declare to me, and the wise men who hear me will say:</verse>
  <verse number="35">‘Job speaks without knowledge; his words lack insight.’</verse>
  <verse number="36">If only Job were tried to the utmost for answering like a wicked man.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For he adds rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God.”</verse>
