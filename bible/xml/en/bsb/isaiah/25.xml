<chapter book="Isaiah" number="25" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">O LORD, You are my God! I will exalt You; I will praise Your name. For You have worked wonders—plans formed long ago—in perfect faithfulness.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Indeed, You have made the city a heap of rubble, the fortified town a ruin. The fortress of strangers is a city no more; it will never be rebuilt.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Therefore, a strong people will honor You. The cities of ruthless nations will revere You.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For You have been a refuge for the poor, a stronghold for the needy in distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat. For the breath of the ruthless is like rain against a wall,</verse>
  <verse number="5">like heat in a dry land. You subdue the uproar of foreigners. As the shade of a cloud cools the heat, so the song of the ruthless is silenced.</verse>
  <verse number="6">On this mountain the LORD of Hosts will prepare a lavish banquet for all the peoples, a feast of aged wine, of choice meat, of finely aged wine.</verse>
  <verse number="7">On this mountain He will swallow up the shroud that enfolds all peoples, the sheet that covers all nations;</verse>
  <verse number="8">He will swallow up death forever. The Lord GOD will wipe away the tears from every face and remove the disgrace of His people from the whole earth. For the LORD has spoken.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And in that day it will be said, “Surely this is our God; we have waited for Him, and He has saved us. This is the LORD for whom we have waited. Let us rejoice and be glad in His salvation.”</verse>
  <verse number="10">For the hand of the LORD will rest on this mountain. But Moab will be trampled in his place as straw is trodden into the dung pile.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He will spread out his hands within it, as a swimmer spreads his arms to swim. His pride will be brought low, despite the skill of his hands.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The high-walled fortress will be brought down, cast to the ground, into the dust.</verse>
