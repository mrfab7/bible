<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech, And hearken to all my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Behold now, I have opened my mouth, My tongue hath spoken in my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart; And that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the Almighty given me life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If thou canst, answer thou me, Set thy words in order before me, stand forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Behold, I am toward God even as thou art; I also am formed out of the clay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, Neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the voice of thy words;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I am clean, without transgression, I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Behold, He findeth occasions against me, He counteth me for His enemy;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He putteth my feet in the stocks, He marketh all my paths.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Behold, I answer thee: In this thou art not right, That God is too great for man;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Why hast thou striven against Him? Seeing that He will not answer any of his words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For God speaketh in one way, Yea in two, though man perceiveth it not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">In a dream, in a vision of the night, When deep sleep falleth upon men, In slumberings upon the bed;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Then He openeth the ears of men, And by their chastisement sealeth the decree,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">That men may put away their purpose, And that He may hide pride from man;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">That He may keep back his soul from the pit, And his life from perishing by the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, And all his bones grow stiff;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">So that his life maketh him to abhor bread, And his soul dainty food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; And his bones corrode to unsightliness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, And his life to the destroyers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If there be for him an angel, An intercessor, one among a thousand, To vouch for a man’s uprightness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Then He is gracious unto him, and saith: ‘Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">His flesh is tenderer than a child’s; He returneth to the days of his youth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He prayeth unto God, and He is favourable unto him; So that he seeth His face with joy; And He restoreth unto man his righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He cometh before men, and saith: ‘I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, And it profited me not.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">So He redeemeth his soul from going into the pit, And his life beholdeth the light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Lo, all these things doth God work, Twice, yea thrice, with a man,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">To bring back his soul from the pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me; Hold thy peace, and I will speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">If thou hast any thing to say, answer me; Speak, for I desire to justify thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If not, hearken thou unto me; Hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.</p>
