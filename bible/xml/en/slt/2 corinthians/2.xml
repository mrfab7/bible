<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="2" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And I determined this to myself, not to come to you again in sadness.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For if I grieve you, and who is he making me glad, except he being grieved by me.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I wrote this same to you lest, coming, I should have sadness from whom I ought to rejoice, trusting to you all, that mine is the joy of you all.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For out of much pressure and anxiety of heart I wrote to you through many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love I have more abundantly towards you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And if any have grieved, he has not grieved me, but by part; that I might not overload you all.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Sufficient to such a one this enjoyment of the esteem of the many.</verse>
  <verse number="7">So that on the contrary ye should rather show kindness, and console, lest perhaps such be swallowed down with more abundant sadness.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Wherefore I beseech you to confirm love to him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For, for this I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, if ye are obedient for all things.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And to whom ye show any favor; I also: for also if I have shown any kindness, to whom I have shown kindness, through you in the face of Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="11">That we might not be taken advantage of by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his inventions.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And coming to Troas for the good news of Christ, and a door having been opened to me in the Lord,</verse>
  <verse number="13">I have had no relaxation to my spirit, in my not finding Titus my brother: but having taken leave of them, I went out to Macedonia.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Grace to God, always leading us to triumph in Christ, and making manifest the order of his knowledge by us in every place.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For we are to God a sweet odor of Christ, in the saved, and in the host:</verse>
  <verse number="16">Truly to those an odor of death into death; and to those an odor of life into life. And who sufficient for these things?</verse>
  <verse number="17">For we are not as the many adulterating the word of God: but as of purity, but as of God, before the face of God speak we in Christ.</verse>
