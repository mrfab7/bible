<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Bildad the Shuhite will answer and say,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How long wilt thou speak these things? and the great spirit of the words of thy mouth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Will God pervert judgment? and if the Almighty will pervert justice?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If thy sons sinned to him, and he will send them away by the hand of their transgression;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If thou shalt seek to God, if thou shalt make supplication to him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If thou wert pure and upright, for now he will awake for thee and requite the habitation of thy justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And thy beginning was small, and thy latter state shall increase greatly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For ask now to the first generation, and prepare to seek their fathers:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">(For yesterday are we and we shall not know, for our days upon earth are a shadow:)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Shall they not teach thee, and say to thee, and bring forth words from their heart?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Shall the bulrush lift itself up without a marsh? shall the marsh grass grow without water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">While yet in its greenness it shall not break off, and it will dry up before grass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">So the paths of all forgetting God and the hope of the profane one shall perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Which his hope shall be cut off, and the spiderâ€™s house his trust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He shall lean upon his house and it shall not stand: he shall hold fast upon it, and it shall not rise up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">It was moist before the sun, and its sprout will come forth upon his garden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">His roots were entwined upon a heap, he shall see a house of stones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If he should swallow him down from his place, and it lied upon it: I saw thee not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Behold, this the rejoicing of his way, and from the dust shall they cause another to grow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Behold, God will not reject the blameless one, and he will not take hold upon the hand of those doing evil:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Till he shall fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with shouts of joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">They hating thee shall put on shame; and the tent of the unjust shall not be.</p>
