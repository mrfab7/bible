<div class="chapter" data-book="Colossians" data-chapter="3" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">If then you were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">When Christ, our life, is revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: sexual immorality, uncleanness, depraved passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">for which things’ sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">You also once walked in those, when you lived in them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">but now you also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and shameful speaking out of your mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Don’t lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">where there can’t be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant, freeman; but Christ is all, and in all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Put on therefore, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and perseverance;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, so you also do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Above all these things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father, through him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Husbands, love your wives, and don’t be bitter against them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Children, obey your parents in all things, for this pleases the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Fathers, don’t provoke your children, so that they won’t be discouraged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Servants, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not just when they are looking, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord, and not for men,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done, and there is no partiality.</p>
