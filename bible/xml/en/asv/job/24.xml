<chapter book="Job" number="24" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Why are times not laid up by the Almighty? And why do not they that know him see his days?</verse>
  <verse number="2">There are that remove the landmarks; They violently take away flocks, and feed them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">They drive away the ass of the fatherless; They take the widow’s ox for a pledge.</verse>
  <verse number="4">They turn the needy out of the way: The poor of the earth all hide themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Behold, as wild asses in the desert They go forth to their work, seeking diligently for food; The wilderness yieldeth them bread for their children.</verse>
  <verse number="6">They cut their provender in the field; And they glean the vintage of the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They lie all night naked without clothing, And have no covering in the cold.</verse>
  <verse number="8">They are wet with the showers of the mountains, And embrace the rock for want of a shelter.</verse>
  <verse number="9">There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast, And take a pledge of the poor;</verse>
  <verse number="10">So that they go about naked without clothing, And being hungry they carry the sheaves.</verse>
  <verse number="11">They make oil within the walls of these men; They tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.</verse>
  <verse number="12">From out of the populous city men groan, And the soul of the wounded crieth out: Yet God regardeth not the folly.</verse>
  <verse number="13">These are of them that rebel against the light; They know not the ways thereof, Nor abide in the paths thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The murderer riseth with the light; He killeth the poor and needy; And in the night he is as a thief.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, Saying, No eye shall see me: And he disguiseth his face.</verse>
  <verse number="16">In the dark they dig through houses: They shut themselves up in the day-time; They know not the light.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For the morning is to all of them as thick darkness; For they know the terrors of the thick darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Swiftly they pass away upon the face of the waters; Their portion is cursed in the earth: They turn not into the way of the vineyards.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Drought and heat consume the snow waters: So doth Sheol those that have sinned.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The womb shall forget him; The worm shall feed sweetly on him; He shall be no more remembered; And unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He devoureth the barren that beareth not, And doeth not good to the widow.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Yet God preserveth the mighty by his power: He riseth up that hath no assurance of life.</verse>
  <verse number="23">God giveth them to be in security, and they rest thereon; And his eyes are upon their ways.</verse>
  <verse number="24">They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone; Yea, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others, And are cut off as the tops of the ears of grain.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar, And make my speech nothing worth?</verse>
