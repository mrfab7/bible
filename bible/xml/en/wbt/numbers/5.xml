  <verse number="1">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whoever is defiled by the dead:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst of which I dwell.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the camp: as the LORD spoke to Moses, so did the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="6">Speak to the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and that person shall be guilty;</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he shall recompense his trespass with the principal of it, and add to it the fifth part of it, and give it to him against whom he hath trespassed.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But if the man shall have no kinsman to recompense the trespass to, let the trespass be recompensed to the LORD, even to the priest; besides the ram of the atonement, by which an atonement shall be made for him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And every offering of all the holy things of the children of Israel, which they bring to the priest, shall be his.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And every man’s hallowed things shall be his: whatever any man giveth to the priest, it shall be his.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="12">Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, If any man’s wife shall go astray, and commit a trespass against him,</verse>
  <verse number="13">And a man shall lie with her carnally, and it shall be hid from the eyes of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner;</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the spirit of jealousy shall come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy shall come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then shall the man bring his wife to the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley-meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense upon it; for it is an offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the LORD:</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take, and put it into the water:</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover the woman’s head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which is the jealousy-offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the curse:</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say to the woman, If no man hath lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:</verse>
  <verse number="20">But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband, and if thou art defiled, and some man hath lain with thee besides thy husband:</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing, and the priest shall say to the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to perish, and thy belly to swell;</verse>
  <verse number="22">And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to perish. And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water:</verse>
  <verse number="24">And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then the priest shall take the jealousy-offering out of the woman’s hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it upon the altar:</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the priest shall take a handful of the offering, even the memorial of it, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she is defiled, and hath done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall perish: and the woman shall be a curse among her people.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And if the woman is not defiled, but is clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed.</verse>
  <verse number="29">This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth astray to another instead of her husband, and is defiled;</verse>
  <verse number="30">Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he is jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman shall bear her iniquity.</verse>
