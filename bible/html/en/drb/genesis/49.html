<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Ruben, my firstborn, thou art my strength, and the beginning of my sorrow: excelling in gifts, greater in command.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thou art poured out as water, grow thou not: because thou wentest up to thy father’s bed, and didst defile his couch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Simeon and Levi brethren: vessels of iniquity, waging war.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Let not my soul go into their counsel, nor my glory be in their assembly: “be- cause in their fury they slew a man, and in their selfwill they undermined a wall.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Zabulon shall dwell on the sea shore, and in the road of ships, reaching as far as Sidon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Issachar shall be a strong ass lying down between the borders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He saw rest that it was good: and the land that it was excellent: and he bowed his shoulder to carry, and became a servant under tribute.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Dan shall judge his people like an- other tribe in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Let Dan be a snake in the way, a serpent in the path, that biteth the horse’s heels that his rider may fall backward.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="24">His bow rested upon the strong, and the bands of his arms and his hands were loosed, by the hands of the mighty one of Jacob: thence he came forth a pastor, the stone of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The God of thy father shall be thy helper, and the Almighty shall bless thee with the blessings of heaven above, with the blessings of the deep that lieth be- neath, with the blessings of the breasts and of the womb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The blessings of thy father are strengthened with the blessings of his fathers: until the desire of the everlasting hills should come; may they be upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the Nazarite among his brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Benjamin a ravenous wolf, in the morning shall eat the prey, and in the evening shall divide the spoil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: these things their father spoke to them, and he blessed every one, with their proper blessings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And he charged them, saying: I am now going to be gathered to my people : bury me with my fathers in the double cave, which is in the field of Ephron the Hethite,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Over against Mambre in the land of Chanaan, which Abraham bought to- gather with the field of Ephron the Hethite for a possession to bury in.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="32"></p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And when he had ended the commandments, wherewith he instructed his sons, he drew up his feet upon the bed, and died: and he was gathered to his people.”</p>
