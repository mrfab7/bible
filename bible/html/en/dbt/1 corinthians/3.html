<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="3" data-translation="Darby Bible Translation" data-translation-id="dbt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And I, brethren, have not been able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly; as to babes in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I have given you milk to drink, not meat, for ye have not yet been able, nor indeed are ye yet able;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">for ye are yet carnal. For whereas [there are] among you emulation and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk according to man?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For when one says, I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, are ye not men?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who then is Apollos, and who Paul? Ministering servants, through whom ye have believed, and as the Lord has given to each.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I have planted; Apollos watered; but God has given the increase.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">So that neither the planter is anything, nor the waterer; but God the giver of the increase.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But the planter and the waterer are one; but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For we are God’s fellow-workmen; ye are God’s husbandry, God’s building.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">According to the grace of God which has been given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation, but another builds upon it. But let each see how he builds upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For other foundation can no man lay besides that which [is] laid, which is Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now if any one build upon [this] foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, straw,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">the work of each shall be made manifest; for the day shall declare [it], because it is revealed in fire; and the fire shall try the work of each what it is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If the work of any one which he has built upon [the foundation] shall abide, he shall receive a reward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If the work of any one shall be consumed, he shall suffer loss, but he shall be saved, but so as through [the] fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Do ye not know that ye are [the] temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwells in you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If any one corrupt the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, and such are ye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Let no one deceive himself: if any one thinks himself to be wise among you in this world, let him become foolish, that he may be wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written, He who takes the wise in their craftiness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And again, [The] Lord knows the reasonings of the wise that they are vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">So that let no one boast in men; for all things are yours.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or [the] world, or life, or death, or things present, or things coming, all are yours;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">and ye [are] Christ’s, and Christ [is] God’s.</p>
