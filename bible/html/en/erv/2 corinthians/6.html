<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And working together with him we entreat also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">(for he saith, At an acceptable time I hearkened unto thee, And in a day of salvation did I succour thee: behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation):</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">giving no occasion of stumbling in anything, that our ministration be not blamed;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">but in everything commending ourselves, as ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">in pureness, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Ghost, in love unfeigned,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">by glory and dishonour, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Our mouth is open unto you, O Corinthians, our heart is enlarged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own affections.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Now for a recompense in like kind (I speak as unto my children), be ye also enlarged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Be not unequally yoked with unbelievers: for what fellowship have righteousness and iniquity? or what communion hath light with darkness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what portion hath a believer with an unbeliever?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And what agreement hath a temple of God with idols? for we are a temple of the living God; even as God said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Wherefore Come ye out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, And touch no unclean thing; And I will receive you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And will be to you a Father, And ye shall be to me sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</p>
