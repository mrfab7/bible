<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by men of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A needy man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of gluttonous men shameth his father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that augmenteth his substance by usury and increase, gathereth it for him that hath pity on the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Whoso causeth the upright to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the perfect shall inherit good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When the righteous triumph, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He that covereth his transgressions shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall obtain mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over a poor people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The prince that lacketh understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A man that is laden with the blood of any person shall flee unto the pit; let no man stay him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Whoso walketh uprightly shall be delivered: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be unpunished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">To have respect of persons is not good: neither that a man should transgress for a piece of bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He that hath an evil eye hasteth after riches, and knoweth not that want shall come upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He that rebuketh a man shall afterward find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He that is of a greedy spirit stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.</p>
