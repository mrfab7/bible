  <verse number="1">After this there was a feast of the Jews: and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue, Bethesda, having five porches.</verse>
  <verse number="3">In these lay a great multitude of impotent persons, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and agitated the water: whoever then first after the stirring of the water stepped in, was cured of whatever disease he had.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And a certain man was there, who had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</verse>
  <verse number="6">When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith to him, Wilt thou be healed?</verse>
  <verse number="7">The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is agitated, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Jesus saith to him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And immediately the man was healed, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The Jews therefore said to him that was cured, it is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He answered them, He that healed me, the same said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Then they asked him, What man is that who said to thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he that was healed knew not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou art cured: sin no more, lest a worse thing come to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Then answered Jesus, and said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son can do nothing by himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for whatever things he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and he will show him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For as the Father raiseth the dead, and reviveth them; even so the Son reviveth whom he will.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For the Father judgeth no man; but hath committed all judgment to the Son:</verse>
  <verse number="23">That all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the Father who hath sent him.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Verily, verily, I say to you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but hath passed from death to life.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Verily, verily, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</verse>
  <verse number="27">And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</verse>
  <verse number="29">And shall come forth; they that have done good to the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of damnation.</verse>
  <verse number="30">I can of my own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father who hath sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="31">If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is not true.</verse>
  <verse number="32">There is another that testifieth concerning me, and I know that the testimony which he beareth concerning me is true.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Ye sent to John, and he testified to the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="34">But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye may be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="35">He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</verse>
  <verse number="36">But I have greater testimony than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear testimony concerning me, that the Father hath sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And the Father himself who hath sent me, hath borne testimony concerning me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.</verse>
  <verse number="39">Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.</verse>
  <verse number="41">I receive not honor from men.</verse>
  <verse number="42">But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</verse>
  <verse number="43">I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</verse>
  <verse number="44">How can ye believe, who receive honor one from another, and seek not the honor that cometh from God only?</verse>
  <verse number="45">Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.</verse>
  <verse number="46">For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote concerning me.</verse>
  <verse number="47">But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</verse>
