  <verse number="1">And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Jacob said when he saw them, This is God’s host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the field of Edom.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye say unto my lord Esau; Thus saith thy servant Jacob, I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now:</verse>
  <verse number="5">and I have oxen, and asses and flocks, and menservants ard maidservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and moreover he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed: and he divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;</verse>
  <verse number="8">and he said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then the company which is left shall escape.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O LORD, which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to thy kindred, and I will do thee good:</verse>
  <verse number="10">I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two companies.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he come and smite me, the mother with the children.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he lodged there that night; and took of that which he had with him a present for Esau his brother;</verse>
  <verse number="14">two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</verse>
  <verse number="15">thirty milch camels and their colts, forty kine and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten foals.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?</verse>
  <verse number="18">then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob’s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, he also is behind us.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And he commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau, when ye find him;</verse>
  <verse number="20">and ye shall say, Moreover, behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">So the present passed over before him: and he himself lodged that night in the company.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids, and his eleven children, and passed over the ford of Jabbok.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over that he had.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was strained, as he wrestled with him.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for thou hast striven with God and with men, and hast prevailed.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he blessed him there.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for, said he, I have seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the sun rose upon him as he passed over Penuel, and he halted upon his thigh.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Therefore the children of Israel eat not the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew of the hip.</verse>
