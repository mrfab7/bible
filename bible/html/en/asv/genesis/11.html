<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it came to pass, as they journeyed east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick, and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they said, Come, let us build us a city, and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven, and let us make us a name; lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Jehovah said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is what they begin to do: and now nothing will be withholden from them, which they purpose to do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">So Jehovah scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off building the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Therefore was the name of it called Babel; because Jehovah did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did Jehovah scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">These are the generations of Shem. Shem was a hundred years old, and begat Arpachshad two years after the flood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and Shem lived after he begat Arpachshad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Arpachshad lived five and thirty years, and begat Shelah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and Arpachshad lived after he begat Shelah four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Shelah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and Shelah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">and Nahor lived after he begat Terah a hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Now these are the generations of Terah. Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. And Haran begat Lot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And Sarai was barren; she had no child.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.</p>
