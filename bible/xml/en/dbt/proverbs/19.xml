  <verse number="6">Many court the favour of a noble; and every one is friend to a man that giveth.</verse>

  <verse number="8">He that getteth sense loveth his own soul; he that keepeth understanding shall find good.</verse>
  <verse number="9">A false witness shall not be held innocent, and he that uttereth lies shall perish.</verse>

  <verse number="28">A witness of Belial scorneth judgment, and the mouth of the wicked swalloweth down iniquity.</verse>
