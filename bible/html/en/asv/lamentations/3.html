<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">He hath led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Surely against me he turneth his hand again and again all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He hath made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He hath walled me about, that I cannot go forth; he hath made my chain heavy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Yea, when I cry, and call for help, he shutteth out my prayer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He hath walled up my ways with hewn stone; he hath made my paths crooked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He is unto me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he hath made me desolate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He hath caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my reins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I am become a derision to all my people, and their song all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath sated me with wormwood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones; he hath covered me with ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace; I forgat prosperity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And I said, My strength is perished, and mine expectation from Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Remember mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is bowed down within me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">This I recall to my mind; therefore have I hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">It is of Jehovahâ€™s lovingkindnesses that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">They are new every morning; great is thy faithfulness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Jehovah is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Jehovah is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he hath laid it upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Let him put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Let him give his cheek to him that smiteth him; let him be filled full with reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For the Lord will not cast off for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">For he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">Out of the mouth of the Most High cometh there not evil and good?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">We have transgressed and have rebelled; thou hast not pardoned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">Thou hast covered with anger and pursued us; thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Thou hast made us an offscouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">Fear and the pit are come upon us, devastation and destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">Mine eye runneth down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">Mine eye poureth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">Till Jehovah look down, and behold from heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">Mine eye affecteth my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">They have chased me sore like a bird, they that are mine enemies without cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">I called upon thy name, O Jehovah, out of the lowest dungeon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">Thou heardest my voice; hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="57">Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee; thou saidst, Fear not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="58">O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="59">O Jehovah, thou hast seen my wrong; judge thou my cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="60">Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="61">Thou hast heard their reproach, O Jehovah, and all their devices against me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="62">The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="63">Behold thou their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="64">Thou wilt render unto them a recompense, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="65">Thou wilt give them hardness of heart, thy curse unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="66">Thou wilt pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Jehovah.</p>
