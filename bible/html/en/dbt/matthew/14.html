<p class="verse" data-verse="1">At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and said to his servants, This is John the baptist: he is risen from the dead, and because of this these works of power display their force in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For Herod had seized John, and had bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For John said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And [while] desiring to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they held him for a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But when Herod’s birthday was celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">whereupon he promised with oath to give her whatsoever she should ask.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But she, being set on by her mother, says, Give me here upon a dish the head of John the baptist.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the king was grieved; but on account of the oaths, and those lying at table with [him], he commanded [it] to be given.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he sent and beheaded John in the prison;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and his head was brought upon a dish, and was given to the damsel, and she carried [it] to her mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and came and brought word to Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Jesus, having heard it, went away thence by ship to a desert place apart. And the crowds having heard [of it] followed him on foot from the cities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And going out he saw a great crowd, and was moved with compassion about them, and healed their infirm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But when even was come, his disciples came to him saying, The place is desert, and [much of] the [day] time already gone by; dismiss the crowds, that they may go into the villages and buy food for themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But Jesus said to them, They have no need to go: give ye them to eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But they say to him, We have not here save five loaves and two fishes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he said, Bring them here to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And having commanded the crowds to recline upon the grass, having taken the five loaves and the two fishes, he looked up to heaven, and blessed: and having broken the loaves, he gave [them] to the disciples, and the disciples [gave them] to the crowds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And all ate and were filled, and they took up what was over and above of fragments twelve hand-baskets full.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But those that had eaten were about five thousand men, besides women and children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And immediately he compelled the disciples to go on board ship, and to go on before him to the other side, until he should have dismissed the crowds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And having dismissed the crowds, he went up into the mountain apart to pray. And when even was come, he was alone there,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">but the ship was already in the middle of the sea tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But in the fourth watch of the night he went off to them, walking on the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And the disciples, seeing him walking on the sea, were troubled, saying, It is an apparition. And they cried out through fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">But Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, Take courage; it is I: be not afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And Peter answering him said, Lord, if it be thou, command me to come to thee upon the waters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And he said, Come. And Peter, having descended from the ship, walked upon the waters to go to Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">But seeing the wind strong he was afraid; and beginning to sink he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught hold of him, and says to him, O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And when they had gone up into the ship, the wind fell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">But those in the ship came and did homage to him, saying, Truly thou art God’s Son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And having crossed over they came to the land of Gennesaret.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And when the men of that place recognised him, they sent to that whole country around, and they brought to him all that were ill,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment; and as many as touched were made thoroughly well.</p>
