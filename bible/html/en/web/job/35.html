<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover Elihu answered,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Do you think this to be your right, or do you say, ‘My righteousness is more than God’s,’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">That you ask, ‘What advantage will it be to you? What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I will answer you, and your companions with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Look to the heavens, and see. See the skies, which are higher than you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If you have sinned, what effect do you have against him? If your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If you are righteous, what do you give him? Or what does he receive from your hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Your wickedness may hurt a man as you are, and your righteousness may profit a son of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">“By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out. They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But none says, ‘Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">who teaches us more than the animals of the earth, and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">There they cry, but none gives answer, because of the pride of evil men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Surely God will not hear an empty cry, neither will the Almighty regard it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">How much less when you say you don’t see him. The cause is before him, and you wait for him!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But now, because he has not visited in his anger, neither does he greatly regard arrogance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Therefore Job opens his mouth with empty talk, and he multiplies words without knowledge.”</p>
