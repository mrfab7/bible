<chapter book="Hebrews" number="5" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">For every chief priest taken from men is appointed for men for things to God, that he bring both gifts and sacrifices for sins:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Being able to moderate the passions to the ignorant, and deceived; since he also is surrounded with weakness.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And for this he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to bring in for sins.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And not any takes this honour to himself; but the called of God, as also Aaron.</verse>
  <verse number="5">So also Christ honoured not himself, to become chief priest; but he having spoken to him, Thou art my Son, to day have I begotten thee.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And also in another he says, Thou a priest forever according to the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Who in the days of his flesh, both prayers and supplications to him able to save him from death, with strong crying and tears, having offered, and listened to by means of circumspection;</verse>
  <verse number="8">Although being a Son, he learned obedience from what he suffered;</verse>
  <verse number="9">And being perfected, he became to all them lending a willing ear to him the origin of eternal salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Addressed by God the chief priest according to the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Of whom great is the word to us, and difficult of interpretation to speak, since ye have been sluggish in the hearing.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For also ye ought to be teachers for the time, again ye have need for some one to teach you the elements of the beginning of the sayings of God; and have become those having need of milk, and not of firm food.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For every one partaking of milk is inexperienced in the word of justice: for he is a child.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And firm food is of the perfected, of them by habit having the senses exercised for the separation of good and evil.</verse>
