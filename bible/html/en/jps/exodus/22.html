<p class="verse" data-verse="1">If a man steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it, he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">If a thief be found breaking in, and be smitten so that he dieth, there shall be no bloodguiltiness for him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If the sun be risen upon him, there shall be bloodguiltiness for him—he shall make restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If the theft be found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep, he shall pay double.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If a man cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall let his beast loose, and it feed in another man’s field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the shocks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field are consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If a man deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man’s house; if the thief be found, he shall pay double.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall come near unto God, to see whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbour’s goods.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For every matter of trespass, whether it be for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, whereof one saith: ‘This is it,’ the cause of both parties shall come before God; he whom God shall condemn shall pay double unto his neighbour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep, and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">the oath of the LORD shall be between them both, to see whether he have not put his hand unto his neighbour’s goods; and the owner thereof shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If it be torn in pieces, let him bring it for witness; he shall not make good that which was torn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And if a man borrow aught of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof not being with it, he shall surely make restitution.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If the owner thereof be with it, he shall not make it good; if it be a hireling, he loseth his hire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And if a man entice a virgin that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to be his wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He that sacrificeth unto the gods, save unto the LORD only, shall be utterly destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And a stranger shalt thou not wrong, neither shalt thou oppress him; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If thou afflict them in any wise—for if they cry at all unto Me, I will surely hear their cry—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">My wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If thou lend money to any of My people, even to the poor with thee, thou shalt not be to him as a creditor; neither shall ye lay upon him interest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">If thou at all take thy neighbour’s garment to pledge, thou shalt restore it unto him by that the sun goeth down;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin; wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto Me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Thou shalt not revile God, nor curse a ruler of thy people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Thou shalt not delay to offer of the fulness of thy harvest, and of the outflow of thy presses. The first-born of thy sons shalt thou give unto Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, and with thy sheep; seven days it shall be with its dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And ye shall be holy men unto Me; therefore ye shall not eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.</p>
