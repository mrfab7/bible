  <verse number="3">And you shall write on them all the words of this law, when you are passed over, that you may go in to the land which the LORD your God gives you, a land that flows with milk and honey; as the LORD God of your fathers has promised you.</verse>

  <verse number="5">And there shall you build an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones: you shall not lift up any iron tool on them.</verse>
  <verse number="6">You shall build the altar of the LORD your God of whole stones: and you shall offer burnt offerings thereon to the LORD your God:</verse>
  <verse number="7">And you shall offer peace offerings, and shall eat there, and rejoice before the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And you shall write on the stones all the words of this law very plainly.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel, saying, Take heed, and listen, O Israel; this day you are become the people of the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">You shall therefore obey the voice of the LORD your God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command you this day.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="12">These shall stand on mount Gerizim to bless the people, when you are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:</verse>
  <verse number="13">And these shall stand on mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the Levites shall speak, and say to all the men of Israel with a loud voice,</verse>
  <verse number="15">Cursed be the man that makes any graven or molten image, an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and puts it in a secret place. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.</verse>
