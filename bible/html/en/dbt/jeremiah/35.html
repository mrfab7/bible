<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak with them, and bring them into the house of Jehovah, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and I brought them into the house of Jehovah, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the threshold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites bowls full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And they said, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, ye nor your sons for ever;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor shall ye have [any]; but all your days ye shall dwell in tents, that ye may live many days in the land where ye sojourn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And we have hearkened unto the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and not to build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">but we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And it came to pass when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come and let us go into Jerusalem because of the army of the Chaldeans, and because of the army of Syria; and we dwell at Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken unto my words? saith Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; and to this day they have drunk none, for they have obeyed their father’s commandment. But I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking, and ye have not hearkened unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them; and ye shall dwell in the land that I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear nor hearkened unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Yea, the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but this people hath not hearkened unto me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">therefore thus saith Jehovah the God of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them, because I have spoken unto them, but they have not hearkened, and I have called unto them, but they have not answered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his injunctions, and have done according unto all that he hath commanded you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, There shall not fail to Jonadab the son of Rechab a man to stand before me, for ever.</p>
