<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thus said the LORD, the God of Israel, to you, O Baruch:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">You did say, Woe is me now! for the LORD has added grief to my sorrow; I fainted in my sighing, and I find no rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thus shall you say to him, The LORD said thus; Behold, that which I have built will I break down, and that which I have planted I will pluck up, even this whole land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And seek you great things for yourself? seek them not: for, behold, I will bring evil on all flesh, said the LORD: but your life will I give to you for a prey in all places where you go.</p>
