<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="10" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My soul is weary of my life. I will release my words against myself. I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I will say to God: Do not be willing to condemn me. Reveal to me why you judge me this way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Does it seem good to you, if you find fault with me and oppress me, the work of your own hands, and assist the counsel of the impious?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Do you have bodily eyes? Or, just as man sees, will you see?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Are your days just like the days of man, and are your years as the times of humans,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">so that you would inquire about my iniquity and examine my sin?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And you know that I have done nothing impious, yet there is no one who can deliver from your hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Your hands have made me and formed me all around, and, in this way, do you suddenly throw me away?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Remember, I ask you, that you have fashioned me like clay, and you will reduce me to dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Have you not extracted me like milk and curdled me like cheese?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">You have clothed me with skin and flesh. You have put me together with bones and nerves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">You have assigned to me life and mercy, and your visitation has preserved my spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Though you may conceal this in your heart, yet I know that you remember everything.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If I have sinned, and you have spared me for an hour, why do you not endure me to be clean from my iniquity?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And if I should be impious, woe to me, and if I should be just, I will not lift up my head, being drenched with affliction and misery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And because of pride, you will seize me like a lioness, and having returned, you torment me to an extraordinary degree.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">You renew your testimony against me, and you multiply your wrath against me, and these punishments make war within me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Why did you lead me out of the womb? If only I had been consumed, so that no eye would ever see me!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I should have been as if I had not been: transferred from the womb to the tomb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Will not my few days be completed soon? Release me, therefore, so that I may lament my sorrows a little,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">before I depart and return no more to a land that is dark and covered with the fog of death,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">a land of misery and darkness, where the shadow of death, and nothing else but everlasting horror, dwells.</p>
