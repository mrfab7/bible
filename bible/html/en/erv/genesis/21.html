<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did unto Sarah as he had spoken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh; every one that heareth will laugh with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should give children suck? for I have borne him a son in his old age.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had borne unto Abraham, mocking.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight on account of his son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way off, as it were a bowshot: for she said, Let me not look upon the death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up her voice, and wept.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will make him a great nation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And God was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son: but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Abraham said, I will swear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of the well of water, which Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing: neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but today.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech; and they two made a covenant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And he said, These seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have digged this well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Wherefore he called that place Beer-sheba; because there they sware both of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">So they made a covenant at Beer-sheba: and Abimelech rose up, and Phicol the captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the LORD, the Everlasting God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And Abraham sojourned in the land of the Philistines many days.</p>
