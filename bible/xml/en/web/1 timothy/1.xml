<chapter book="1 Timothy" number="1" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and Christ Jesus our hope;</verse>
  <verse number="2">to Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="3">As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus that you might command certain men not to teach a different doctrine,</verse>
  <verse number="4">neither to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes, rather than God’s stewardship, which is in faith—</verse>
  <verse number="5">but the goal of this command is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith;</verse>
  <verse number="6">from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned aside to vain talking;</verse>
  <verse number="7">desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor about what they strongly affirm.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But we know that the law is good, if a man uses it lawfully,</verse>
  <verse number="9">as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</verse>
  <verse number="10">for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;</verse>
  <verse number="11">according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And I thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he counted me faithful, appointing me to service;</verse>
  <verse number="13">although I was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</verse>
  <verse number="16">However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience, for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="18">This instruction I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to you, that by them you may wage the good warfare;</verse>
  <verse number="19">holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith;</verse>
  <verse number="20">of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered to Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.</verse>
