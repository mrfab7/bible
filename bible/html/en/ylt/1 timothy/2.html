<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I exhort, then, first of all, there be made supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, for all men:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">for kings, and all who are in authority, that a quiet and peaceable life we may lead in all piety and gravity,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">for this is right and acceptable before God our Saviour,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">who doth will all men to be saved, and to come to the full knowledge of the truth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">for one is God, one also is mediator of God and of men, the man Christ Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">who did give himself a ransom for all—the testimony in its own times—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">in regard to which I was set a preacher and apostle—truth I say in Christ, I do not lie—a teacher of nations, in faith and truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I wish, therefore, that men pray in every place, lifting up kind hands, apart from anger and reasoning;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">in like manner also the women, in becoming apparel, with modesty and sobriety to adorn themselves, not in braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or garments of great price,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">but—which becometh women professing godly piety—through good works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Let a woman in quietness learn in all subjection,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">and a woman I do not suffer to teach, nor to rule a husband, but to be in quietness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">for Adam was first formed, then Eve,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, into transgression came,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and she shall be saved through the child-bearing, if they remain in faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety.</p>
