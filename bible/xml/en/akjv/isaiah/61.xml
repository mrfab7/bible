<chapter book="Isaiah" number="61" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on me; because the LORD has anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;</verse>
  <verse number="2">To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;</verse>
  <verse number="3">To appoint to them that mourn in Zion, to give to them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But you shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call you the Ministers of our God: you shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall you boast yourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For your shame you shall have double; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be to them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the LORD has blessed.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For as the earth brings forth her bud, and as the garden causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.</verse>
