  <verse number="1">I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Then I asked, “Where are you going?” He said to me, “To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth and what is its length.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">Behold, the angel who talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,</verse>
  <verse number="4">and said to him, “Run, speak to this young man, saying, ‘Jerusalem will be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of men and livestock in it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For I,’ says Yahweh, ‘will be to her a wall of fire around it, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Come! Come! Flee from the land of the north,’ says Yahweh; ‘for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the sky,’ says Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="7">‘Come, Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon.’</verse>
  <verse number="8">For thus says Yahweh of Armies: ‘For honor he has sent me to the nations which plundered you; for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For, behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they will be a spoil to those who served them; and you will know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion; for, behold, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of you,’ says Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Many nations shall join themselves to Yahweh in that day, and shall be my people; and I will dwell in the midst of you, and you shall know that Yahweh of Armies has sent me to you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Yahweh will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Be silent, all flesh, before Yahweh; for he has roused himself from his holy habitation!”</verse>
