<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job, answering, said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Are you, therefore, alone among men, and will wisdom die with you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I have a heart just as you also do, and I am not inferior to you. For who is ignorant of these things, which you know?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He who is mocked by his friends as I am, will call upon God, and he will listen to him because it is the sincerity of the just that is being mocked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The lamp that is despised in the thoughts of the rich is ready for the appointed time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The tabernacles of robbers are numerous, and they provoke God boldly; whereas, it is he who has given all things into their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In truth, ask the mules, and they will teach you, and the birds of the sky, and they will reveal to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Speak with the earth, and it will respond to you, and the fish of the sea will explain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who is ignorant that the hand of the Lord has made all these things?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">In his hand is the soul of all the living and the spirit of all the flesh of mankind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Does not the ear perceive words, and the palate, when eating, perceive flavor?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">In old age is wisdom, and in length of days is prudence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">With him is wisdom and strength, he has counsel and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If he tears down, there is no one who can build up; if he encloses a man, there is no one who can open.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If he restrains the waters, everything will dry up; and if he sends them forth, they will subdue the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">With him is strength and wisdom; he knows both the deceiver and he who is deceived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He leads advisors to a foolish end and judges to stupidity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He removes the belt of kings and encircles their waist with a rope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He leads away priests in dishonor and displaces nobles,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">altering the lips of those who speak the truth and sweeping away the teaching of the aged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He pours distain upon the leaders, relieving those who had been oppressed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He reveals the depths of the darkness, and he brings the shadow of death into the light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He multiplies peoples, and destroys them, and, having been overthrown, he restores them anew.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He transforms the heart of the leaders of the people on earth, and misleads those who in vain advance upon the inviolable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">They will grope as in the darkness, not the light, and he will make them stagger like drunkards.</p>
