<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And ye being dead in faults and in sins;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">In which when ye walked according to the life of this world, according to the ruler of the power of the air, of the spirit now energetic in the sons of disobedience:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Among whom also we then all occupied ourselves in the eager desire? of our flesh, doing the wills of the flesh and the thoughts; and were by nature children of wrath, as also the rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But God, being rich in mercy, by his much love which he loved us,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And we being dead in faults, he made alive together with Christ, (by grace are ye saved;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And raised together, and seated together in heavenlies in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">That he might show in times coming the surpassing riches of his grace in kindness to us in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For by grace are ye saved through faith; and this not of you: the gift of God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Not of works, lest any one should boast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For we are his work, created in Christ Jesus to good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Wherefore remember, that ye then the nations in the flesh, being reckoned Uncircumcision by the Circumcision in the flesh reckoned made by hands;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">That ye were in that time without Christ alienated from the citizenship of Israel, and foreigners from the covenants of solemn promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And now in Christ Jesus ye who then being far off have become near in the blood of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For he is our peace, having made both one, and having loosed the middle partition wall of the enclosure;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The enmity in his flesh, the law of commands in enactments, having left unemployed; that he might create in himself one new man, making peace;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And that he might reconcile anew both in one body to God by the cross, having slain the enmity in it:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And having come, he announced good news, peace to you afar off, and to those near.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For by him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Wherefore then are ye no more foreigners and sojourners, but fellow citizens of the holy, and the household of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Built upon the foundation of the sent, and of the prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the corner stone;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">In whom all the building fitted together increases into a holy temple in the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">In whom also ye are builded together for the dwelling of God in the Spirit.</p>
