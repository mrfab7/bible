  <verse number="1">And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that the word of the LORD came to Zechariah in the fourth day of the ninth month, even in Chisleu;</verse>
  <verse number="2">When they had sent to the house of God Sherezer and Regem-melech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,</verse>
  <verse number="3">And to speak to the priests who were in the house of the LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so many years?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then came the word of the LORD of hosts to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast to me, even to me?</verse>
  <verse number="6">And when ye ate, and when ye drank, did ye not eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and her cities around her, when men inhabited the south and the plain?</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the word of the LORD came to Zechariah, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="9">Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true judgment, and show mercy and compassions every man to his brother:</verse>
  <verse number="10">And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But they refused to hearken, and withdrew the shoulder, and stopped their ears, that they should not hear.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Yes, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD of hosts:</verse>
  <verse number="14">But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them, that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the pleasant land desolate.</verse>
