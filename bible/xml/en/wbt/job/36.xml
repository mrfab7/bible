  <verse number="1">Elihu also proceeded, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Suffer me a little, and I will show thee that I have yet to speak on God’s behalf.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I will bring my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yes, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And if they are bound in fetters, and are held in cords of affliction;</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then he showeth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.</verse>
  <verse number="14">They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.</verse>
  <verse number="15">He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table would be full of fatness.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapor of it.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Which the clouds do drop and distill upon man abundantly.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?</verse>
  <verse number="30">Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="31">For by them he judgeth the people; he giveth food in abundance.</verse>
  <verse number="32">With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the intervening cloud.</verse>
  <verse number="33">The noise of it showeth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapor.</verse>
