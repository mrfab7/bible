  <verse number="1">The Vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, For the LORD hath spoken: Children I have reared, and brought up, And they have rebelled against Me.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The ox knoweth his owner, And the ass his master’s crib; But Israel doth not know, My people doth not consider.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Ah sinful nation, A people laden with iniquity, A seed of evil-doers, Children that deal corruptly; They have forsaken the LORD, They have contemned the Holy One of Israel, They are turned away backward.</verse>
  <verse number="5">On what part will ye yet be stricken, Seeing ye stray away more and more? The whole head is sick, And the whole heart faint;</verse>
  <verse number="6">From the sole of the foot even unto the head There is no soundness in it; But wounds, and bruises, and festering sores: They have not been pressed, neither bound up, Neither mollified with oil.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Your country is desolate; Your cities are burned with fire; Your land, strangers devour it in your presence, And it is desolate, as overthrown by floods.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the daughter of Zion is left As a booth in a vineyard, As a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, As a besieged city.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Except the LORD of hosts Had left unto us a very small remnant, We should have been as Sodom, We should have been like unto Gomorrah.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Hear the word of the LORD, Ye rulers of Sodom; Give ear unto the law of our God, Ye people of Gomorrah.</verse>
  <verse number="11">To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto Me? Saith the LORD; I am full of the burnt-offerings of rams, And the fat of fed beasts; And I delight not in the blood Of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.</verse>
  <verse number="12">When ye come to appear before Me, Who hath required this at your hand, To trample My courts?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Bring no more vain oblations; It is an offering of abomination unto Me; New moon and sabbath, the holding of convocations—I cannot endure iniquity along with the solemn assembly.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Your new moons and your appointed seasons My soul hateth; They are a burden unto Me; I am weary to bear them.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide Mine eyes from you; Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear; Your hands are full of blood.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Wash you, make you clean, Put away the evil of your doings From before Mine eyes, Cease to do evil;</verse>
  <verse number="17">Learn to do well; Seek justice, relieve the oppressed, Judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Come now, and let us reason together, Saith the LORD; Though your sins be as scarlet, They shall be as white as snow; Though they be red like crimson, They shall be as wool.</verse>
  <verse number="19">If ye be willing and obedient, Ye shall eat the good of the land;</verse>
  <verse number="20">But if ye refuse and rebel, Ye shall be devoured with the sword; For the mouth of the LORD hath spoken.</verse>
  <verse number="21">How is the faithful city Become a harlot! She that was full of justice, Righteousness lodged in her, But now murderers.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Thy silver is become dross, Thy wine mixed with water.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Thy princes are rebellious, And companions of thieves; Every one loveth bribes, And followeth after rewards; They judge not the fatherless, Neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore saith the Lord, the LORD of hosts, The Mighty One of Israel: Ah, I will ease Me of Mine adversaries, And avenge Me of Mine enemies;</verse>
  <verse number="25">And I will turn My hand upon thee, And purge away thy dross as with lye, And will take away all thine alloy;</verse>
  <verse number="26">And I will restore thy judges as at the first, And thy counsellors as at the beginning; Afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness, The faithful city.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Zion shall be redeemed with justice, And they that return of her with righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But the destruction of the transgressors and the sinners shall be together, And they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For they shall be ashamed of the terebinths which ye have desired, And ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For ye shall be as a terebinth whose leaf fadeth, And as a garden that hath no water.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the strong shall be as tow, And his work as a spark; And they shall both burn together, And none shall quench them.</verse>
