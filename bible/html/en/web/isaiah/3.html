<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="3" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">For, behold, the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah supply and support, the whole supply of bread, and the whole supply of water;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">the mighty man, the man of war, the judge, the prophet, the diviner, the elder,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">the captain of fifty, the honorable man, the counselor, the skilled craftsman, and the clever enchanter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I will give boys to be their princes, and children shall rule over them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The people will be oppressed, everyone by another, and everyone by his neighbor. The child will behave himself proudly against the old man, and the base against the honorable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Indeed a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying, “You have clothing, you be our ruler, and let this ruin be under your hand.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In that day he will cry out, saying, “I will not be a healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing. You shall not make me ruler of the people.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against Yahweh, to provoke the eyes of his glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The look of their faces testify against them. They parade their sin like Sodom. They don’t hide it. Woe to their soul! For they have brought disaster upon themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Tell the righteous “Good!” For they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon them; for the deeds of his hands will be paid back to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. My people, those who lead you cause you to err, and destroy the way of your paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Yahweh stands up to contend, and stands to judge the peoples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Yahweh will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and their leaders: “It is you who have eaten up the vineyard. The spoil of the poor is in your houses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">What do you mean that you crush my people, and grind the face of the poor?” says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Moreover Yahweh said, “Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with outstretched necks and flirting eyes, walking to trip as they go, jingling ornaments on their feet;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">therefore the Lord brings sores on the crown of the head of the women of Zion, and Yahweh will make their scalps bald.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, the headbands, the crescent necklaces,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">the earrings, the bracelets, the veils,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">the headdresses, the ankle chains, the sashes, the perfume bottles, the charms,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">the signet rings, the nose rings,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">the fine robes, the capes, the cloaks, the purses,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">the hand mirrors, the fine linen garments, the tiaras, and the shawls.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">It shall happen that instead of sweet spices, there shall be rottenness; instead of a belt, a rope; instead of well set hair, baldness; instead of a robe, a wearing of sackcloth; and branding instead of beauty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Your men shall fall by the sword, and your mighty in the war.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall be desolate and sit on the ground.</p>
