<p class="verse" data-verse="1">At this also my heart trembleth, And is moved out of its place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear attentively the noise of His voice, And the sound that goeth out of His mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven, And His lightning unto the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">After it a voice roareth; He thundereth with the voice of His majesty; And He stayeth them not when His voice is heard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">God thundereth marvellously with His voice; Great things doeth He, which we cannot comprehend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For He saith to the snow: ‘Fall thou on the earth’; Likewise to the shower of rain, and to the showers of His mighty rain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He sealeth up the hand of every man, That all men whom He hath made may know it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then the beasts go into coverts, And remain in their dens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Out of the Chamber cometh the storm; And cold out of the north.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">By the breath of God ice is given, And the breadth of the waters is straitened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Yea, He ladeth the thick cloud with moister, He spreadeth abroad the cloud of His lightning;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And they are turned round about by His guidance, That they may do whatsoever He commandeth them Upon the face of the habitable world:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whether it be for correction, or for His earth, Or for mercy, that He cause it to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Hearken unto this, O Job; Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Dost thou know how God enjoineth them, And causeth the lightning of His cloud to shine?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, The wondrous works of Him who is perfect in knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Thou whose garments are warm, When the earth is still by reason of the south wind;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Canst thou with Him spread out the sky, Which is strong as a molten mirror?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Teach us what we shall say unto Him; For we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Shall it be told Him that I would speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies; But the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Out of the north cometh golden splendour, About God is terrible majesty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The Almighty, whom we cannot find out, is excellent in power, Yet to judgment and plenteous justice He doeth no violence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Men do therefore fear Him; He regardeth not any that are wise of heart.</p>
