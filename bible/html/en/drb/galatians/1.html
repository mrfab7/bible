<div class="chapter" data-book="Galatians" data-chapter="1" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present wicked world, according to the will of God and our Father:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">To whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Which is not another, only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach to you a gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For neither did I receive it of man, nor did I learn it; but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews’ religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And I made progress in the Jews’ religion above many of my equals in my own nation, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But when it pleased him, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Neither went I to Jerusalem, to the apostles who were before me: but I went into Arabia, and again I returned to Damascus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem, to see Peter, and I tarried with him fifteen days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But other of the apostles I saw none, saving James the brother of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But they had heard only: He, who persecuted us in times past, doth now preach the faith which once he impugned:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And they glorified God in me.</p>
