  <verse number="1">And all the company of the sons of Israel are assembled at Shiloh, and they cause the tent of meeting to tabernacle there, and the land hath been subdued before them.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And there are left among the sons of Israel who have not shared their inheritance, seven tribes,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and Joshua saith unto the sons of Israel, ‘Till when are ye remiss to go in to possess the land which He hath given to you, Jehovah, God of your fathers?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Give for you three men for a tribe, and I send them, and they rise and go up and down through the land, and describe it according to their inheritance, and come in unto me,</verse>
  <verse number="5">and they have divided it into seven portions—Judah doth stay by its border on the south, and the house of Joseph do stay by their border on the north—</verse>
  <verse number="6">and ye describe the land in seven portions, and have brought it in unto me hither, and I have cast for you a lot here before Jehovah our God;</verse>
  <verse number="7">for there is no portion to the Levites in your midst, for the priesthood of Jehovah is their inheritance, and Gad, and Reuben, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh received their inheritance beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses servant of Jehovah gave to them.’</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the men rise and go; and Joshua commandeth those who are going to describe the land, saying, ‘Go, and walk up and down through the land, and describe it, and turn back unto me, and here I cast for you a lot before Jehovah in Shiloh.’</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the men go, and pass over through the land, and describe it by cities, in seven portions, on a book, and they come in unto Joshua, unto the camp, at Shiloh.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Joshua casteth for them a lot in Shiloh before Jehovah, and there Joshua apportioneth the land to the sons of Israel, according to their divisions.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And a lot goeth up for the tribe of the sons of Benjamin, for their families; and the border of their lot goeth out between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the border is to them at the north side from the Jordan, and the border hath gone up unto the side of Jericho on the north, and gone up through the hill-country westward, and its outgoings have been at the wilderness of Beth-Aven;</verse>
  <verse number="13">and the border hath gone over thence to Luz, unto the side of Luz (it is Beth-El) southward, and the border hath gone down to Atroth-Addar, by the hill that is on the south of the lower Beth-Horon;</verse>
  <verse number="14">and the border hath been marked out, and hath gone round to the corner of the sea southward, from the hill which is at the front of Beth-Horon southward, and its outgoings have been unto Kirjath-Baal (it is Kirjath-Jearim), a city of the sons of Judah: this is the west quarter.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the south quarter is from the end of Kirjath-Jearim, and the border hath gone out westward, and gone out unto the fountain of the waters of Nephtoah;</verse>
  <verse number="16">and the border hath come down unto the extremity of the hill which is on the front of the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the valley of the Rephaim northward, and hath gone down the valley of Hinnom unto the side of Jebusi southward, and gone down to En-Rogel,</verse>
  <verse number="17">and hath been marked out on the north, and gone out to En-Shemesh, and gone out unto Geliloth, which is over-against the ascent of Adummim, and gone down to the stone of Bohan son of Reuben,</verse>
  <verse number="18">and passed over unto the side over-against Arabah northward, and gone down to Arabah;</verse>
  <verse number="19">and the border hath passed over unto the side of Beth-Hoglah northward, and the outgoings of the border have been unto the north bay of the salt sea, unto the south extremity of the Jordan; this is the south border;</verse>
  <verse number="20">and the Jordan doth border it at the east quarter; this is the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, by its borders round about, for their families.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the cities for the tribe of the sons of Benjamin, for their families, have been Jericho, and Beth-Hoglah, and the valley of Keziz,</verse>
  <verse number="22">and Beth-Arabah, Zemaraim, and Beth-El,</verse>
  <verse number="23">and Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah,</verse>
  <verse number="24">and Chephar-Haammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities and their villages.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,</verse>
  <verse number="26">and Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,</verse>
  <verse number="27">and Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,</verse>
  <verse number="28">and Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi (it is Jerusalem), Gibeath, Kirjath: fourteen cities and their villages. This is the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, for their families.</verse>
