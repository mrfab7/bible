<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="1" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">These are the proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">for gaining wisdom and discipline, for comprehending words of insight,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and for receiving instruction in wise living and in righteousness, justice, and equity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To impart prudence to the simple and knowledge and discretion to the young,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">let the wise listen and gain instruction, and the discerning acquire wise counsel</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">by understanding the proverbs and parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction, and do not forsake the teaching of your mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For they are a garland of grace on your head and a pendant around your neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">My son, if sinners entice you, do not yield to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If they say, “Come along, let us lie in wait for blood, let us ambush the innocent without cause,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">let us swallow them alive like Sheol, and whole like those descending into the Pit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">We will find all manner of precious goods; we will fill our houses with plunder.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Throw in your lot with us; let us all share one purse”—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">my son, do not walk the road with them or set foot upon their path.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For their feet run to evil, and they are swift to shed blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">How futile it is to spread the net where any bird can see it!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But they lie in wait for their own blood; they ambush their own lives.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Such is the fate of all who are greedy, whose unjust gain takes the lives of its possessors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Wisdom calls out in the street, she lifts her voice in the square;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">in the main concourse she cries aloud, at the city gates she makes her speech:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">“How long, O simple ones, will you love your simple ways? How long will scoffers delight in their scorn and fools hate knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If you had repented at my rebuke, then surely I would have poured out my spirit on you; I would have made my words known to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Because you refused my call, and no one took my outstretched hand,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">because you neglected all my counsel, and wanted none of my correction,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">in turn I will mock your calamity; I will sneer when terror strikes you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">when your dread comes like a storm, and your destruction like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish overwhelm you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Then they will call on me, but I will not answer; they will earnestly seek me, but will not find me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For they hated knowledge and chose not to fear the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">They accepted none of my counsel; they despised all my reproof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">So they will eat the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For the waywardness of the simple will slay them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">But whoever listens to me will dwell in safety, secure from the fear of evil.”</p>
