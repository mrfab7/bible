<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Concerning the Ammonites, this is what the LORD says: “Has Israel no sons? Is he without heir? Why then has Milcom taken possession of Gad? Why have his people settled in their cities?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will sound the battle cry against Rabbah of the Ammonites. It will become a heap of ruins, and its villages will be burned. Then Israel will drive out their dispossessors, says the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai has been destroyed; cry out, O daughters of Rabbah! Put on sackcloth and mourn; run back and forth within your walls, for Milcom will go into exile together with his priests and officials.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Why do you boast of your valleys—your valleys so fruitful, O faithless daughter? You trust in your riches and say, ‘Who can come against me?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Behold, I am about to bring terror upon you, declares the Lord GOD of Hosts, from all those around you. You will each be driven headlong, with no one to regather the fugitives.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Yet afterward I will restore the Ammonites from captivity,” declares the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Concerning Edom, this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Is there no longer wisdom in Teman? Has counsel perished from the prudent? Has their wisdom decayed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Turn and run! Lie low, O dwellers of Dedan, for I will bring disaster on Esau at the time I punish him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">If grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave some gleanings? Were thieves to come in the night, would they not steal only what they wanted?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But I will strip Esau bare; I will uncover his hiding places, and he will be unable to conceal himself. His descendants will be destroyed along with his relatives and neighbors, and he will be no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Abandon your orphans; I will preserve their lives. Let your widows trust in Me.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For this is what the LORD says: “If those who do not deserve to drink the cup must drink it, can you possibly remain unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for you must drink it too.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For by Myself I have sworn, declares the LORD, that Bozrah will become a desolation, a disgrace, a ruin, and a curse, and all her cities will be in ruins forever.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I have heard a message from the LORD; an envoy has been sent to the nations: “Assemble yourselves to march against her! Rise up for battle!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">“For behold, I will make you small among nations, despised among men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The terror you cause and the pride of your heart have deceived you, O dwellers in the clefts of the rocks, O occupiers of the mountain summit. Though you elevate your nest like the eagle, even from there I will bring you down,” declares the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">“Edom will become an object of horror. All who pass by will be appalled and will scoff at all her wounds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">As Sodom and Gomorrah were overthrown along with their neighbors,” says the LORD, “no one will dwell there; no man will abide there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Behold, one will come up like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan to the watered pasture. For in an instant I will chase Edom from her land. Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this? For who is like Me, and who can challenge Me? What shepherd can stand against Me?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Therefore hear the plans that the LORD has drawn up against Edom and the strategies He has devised against the people of Teman: Surely the little ones of the flock will be dragged away; certainly their pasture will be made desolate because of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">At the sound of their fall the earth will quake; their cry will resound to the Red Sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Look! An eagle will soar and swoop down, spreading its wings over Bozrah. In that day the hearts of Edom’s mighty men will be like the heart of a woman in labor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Concerning Damascus: “Hamath and Arpad are put to shame, for they have heard a bad report; they are agitated like the sea; their anxiety cannot be calmed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Damascus has become feeble; she has turned to flee. Panic has gripped her; anguish and pain have seized her like a woman in labor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">How is the city of praise not forsaken, the town that brings Me joy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For her young men will fall in the streets, and all her warriors will be silenced in that day,” declares the LORD of Hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">“I will set fire to the walls of Damascus; it will consume the fortresses of Ben-hadad.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated, this is what the LORD says: “Rise up, advance against Kedar, and destroy the people of the east!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">They will take their tents and flocks, their tent curtains and all their goods. They will take their camels for themselves. They will shout to them: ‘Terror is on every side!’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Run! Escape quickly! Lie low, O residents of Hazor,” declares the LORD, “for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has drawn up a plan against you; he has devised a strategy against you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Rise up, advance against a nation at ease, one that dwells securely,” declares the LORD. “They have no gates or bars; they live alone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Their camels will become plunder, and their large herds will be spoil. I will scatter to the wind in every direction those who shave their temples; I will bring calamity on them from all sides,” declares the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">“Hazor will become a haunt for jackals, a desolation forever. No one will dwell there; no man will abide there.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">This is the word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Behold, I will shatter Elam’s bow, the mainstay of their might.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">I will bring the four winds against Elam from the four corners of the heavens, and I will scatter them to all these winds. There will not be a nation to which Elam’s exiles will not go.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">So I will shatter Elam before their foes, before those who seek their lives. I will bring disaster upon them, even My fierce anger,” declares the LORD. “I will send out the sword after them until I finish them off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">I will set My throne in Elam, and destroy its king and officials,” declares the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">“Yet in the last days, I will restore Elam from captivity,” declares the LORD.</p>
