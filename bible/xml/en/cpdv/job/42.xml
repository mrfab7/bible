<chapter book="Job" number="42" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Then Job, responding to the Lord, said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">I know that you are able to do all things, and that no thoughts are hidden from you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">So, who is it that would disguise a lack of knowledge as counsel? Therefore, I have been speaking foolishly, about things whose measure exceeds my knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Listen, and I will speak. I will question you, and you may answer me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">By paying attention with the ear, I have heard you, but now my eye sees you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Therefore, I find myself reprehensible, and I will do penance in embers and ashes.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But after the Lord had finished speaking these words to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Themanite: My wrath has been kindled against you, and against your two friends, because you have not been speaking correctly in my eyes, as my servant Job has done.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Therefore, have seven bulls and seven rams brought to you, and go to my servant Job, and offer these as a holocaust for yourselves. But also, my servant Job will pray for you; I will accept his face, so that foolishness will not be imputed to you. For you have not been speaking correctly about me, as my servant Job has done.</verse>
  <verse number="9">So Eliphaz the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Zophar the Naamathite departed, and they did just as the Lord had spoken to them, and the Lord accepted the face of Job.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Likewise, the Lord was moved by the repentance of Job, when he prayed for his friends. And the Lord gave to Job twice as much as he had before.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Yet all his brethren came to him, and all his sisters, and everyone who had known him before, and they ate bread with him in his house. They also shook their heads over him and comforted him, because of all the bad things that God had inflicted on him. And each one of them gave him one female sheep, and one earring of gold.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the Lord blessed the latter end of Job even more than his beginning. And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand pairs of oxen, and a thousand she-donkeys.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he had seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he called the name of one, Daylight, and the name of the second, Cinnamon, and the name of the third, Horn of Cosmetics.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And, in the whole world, there were not found women so beautiful as the daughters of Job. And so their father gave them an inheritance along with their brothers.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But Job lived long after these events, for a hundred and forty years, and he saw his children, and his children’s children, all the way to the fourth generation,</verse>
  <verse number="17">and he died an old man and full of days.</verse>

  <verse number="161">Psalm 14:3	They have all gone astray; together they have become useless. There is no one who does good; there is not even one. Their throat is an open sepulcher. With their tongues, they have been acting deceitfully; the venom of asps is under their lips. Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness. Their feet are swift to shed blood.

  <verse number="823">Psalm 55:13	Truly, you are a man of one mind: my leader and my acquaintance,</verse>

  <verse number="829">Psalm 55:19	God will hear, and He who is before time will humble them. For there is no change with them, and they have not feared God.</verse>

  <verse number="843">Psalm 56:10	Then my enemies will be turned back. On whatever day that I call upon you, behold, I know that you are my God.</verse>

  <verse number="1099">Psalm 73:1	A Psalm of Asaph. How good is God to Israel, to those who are upright in heart.</verse>
  <verse number="1100">Psalm 73:2	But my feet were nearly moved; my steps had nearly slipped.</verse>
  <verse number="1101">Psalm 73:3	For I was zealous over the iniquitous, seeing the peacefulness of sinners.</verse>
  <verse number="1102">Psalm 73:4	For they have no respect for their death, nor do they have support in their wounds.</verse>
  <verse number="1103">Psalm 73:5	They are not with the hardships of men, nor will they be scourged with men.</verse>
  <verse number="1104">Psalm 73:6	Therefore, arrogance has held on to them. They have been covered with their iniquity and impiety.</verse>

  <verse number="1116">Psalm 73:18	So, because of deceitfulness, truly, you have placed it before them. While they were being lifted up, you were casting them down.</verse>

  <verse number="1130">Psalm 74:4	And those who hate you have been glorified, in the midst of your solemnity. They have set up their own signs as a proof,</verse>
  <verse number="1131">Psalm 74:5	as if it had been issued from on high; yet they did not understand. As in a forest of chopped wood,</verse>
  <verse number="1132">Psalm 74:6	they have cut down the entrances themselves. With axe and hatchet, they have brought it down.</verse>
  <verse number="1133">Psalm 74:7	They have set fire to your Sanctuary. They have polluted the tabernacle of your name on earth.</verse>
  <verse number="1134">Psalm 74:8	They have said in their heart, the whole group of them together: “Let us cause all the feast days of God to cease from the land.</verse>

  <verse number="1141">Psalm 74:15	You have disrupted the fountains and the torrents. You have dried up the rivers of Ethan.</verse>
  <verse number="1142">Psalm 74:16	Yours is the day, and yours is the night. You have made the morning light and the sun.</verse>
  <verse number="1143">Psalm 74:17	You have made all the limits of the earth. The summer and the spring were formed by you.</verse>

  <verse number="1148">Psalm 74:22	Rise up, O God, judge your own case. Call to mind the accusations against you, which are made by the foolish all day long.</verse>
  <verse number="1149">Psalm 74:23	Do not forget the voices of your adversaries. The arrogance of those who hate you rises up continually.</verse>
  <verse number="1150">Psalm 75:1	Unto the end. May you not be corrupted. A Canticle Psalm of Asaph. We will confess to you, O God. We will confess, and we will call upon your name. We will describe your wonders.</verse>
  <verse number="1151">Psalm 75:2	While I have time, I will judge justices.</verse>
  <verse number="1152">Psalm 75:3	The earth has been dissolved, with all who dwell in it. I have confirmed its pillars.</verse>

  <verse number="1160">Psalm 76:1	Unto the end. With Praises. A Psalm of Asaph. A Canticle to the Assyrians. In Judea, God is known. In Israel, his name is great.</verse>
  <verse number="1161">Psalm 76:2	And his place has been formed with peace. And his dwelling place is in Zion.</verse>
  <verse number="1162">Psalm 76:3	In that place, he has broken the powers of the bows, the shield, the sword, and the battle.</verse>
  <verse number="1163">Psalm 76:4	You illuminate wondrously from the mountains of eternity.</verse>
  <verse number="1164">Psalm 76:5	All the foolish of heart have been disturbed. They have slept their sleep, and all the men of riches have found nothing in their hands.</verse>
  <verse number="1165">Psalm 76:6	At your rebuke, O God of Jacob, those who were mounted on horseback have fallen asleep.</verse>
  <verse number="1166">Psalm 76:7	You are terrible, and so, who can withstand you? From thence is your wrath.</verse>
  <verse number="1167">Psalm 76:8	You have caused judgment to be heard from heaven. The earth trembled and was quieted,</verse>
  <verse number="1168">Psalm 76:9	when God rose up in judgment in order to bring salvation to all the meek of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="1169">Psalm 76:10	For the thinking of man will confess to you, and the legacy of his thinking will keep a feast day to you.</verse>
  <verse number="1170">Psalm 76:11	Make vows and pay them to the Lord, your God. All you who surround him bring gifts: to him who is terrible,</verse>

  <verse number="1172">Psalm 77:1	Unto the end. For Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph. I cried out to the Lord with my voice, to God with my voice, and he attended to me.</verse>
  <verse number="1173">Psalm 77:2	In the days of my tribulation, I sought God, with my hands opposite him in the night, and I was not deceived. My soul refused to be consoled.</verse>
  <verse number="1174">Psalm 77:3	I was mindful of God, and I was delighted, and I was distressed, and my spirit fell away.</verse>
  <verse number="1175">Psalm 77:4	My eyes anticipated the vigils. I was disturbed, and I did not speak.</verse>
  <verse number="1176">Psalm 77:5	I considered the days of antiquity, and I held the years of eternity in my mind.</verse>
  <verse number="1177">Psalm 77:6	And I meditated in the night with my heart, and I was distressed, and I examined my spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="1178">Psalm 77:7	So then, will God reject for eternity? Will he not continue to allow himself to show favor?</verse>
  <verse number="1179">Psalm 77:8	Or, will he cut off his mercy in the end, from generation to generation?</verse>
  <verse number="1180">Psalm 77:9	And would God ever forget to be merciful? Or, would he, in his wrath, restrict his mercies?</verse>
  <verse number="1181">Psalm 77:10	And I said, “Now I have begun. This change is from the right hand of the Most High.”</verse>
  <verse number="1182">Psalm 77:11	I was mindful of the works of the Lord. For I will be mindful from the beginning of your wonders,</verse>
  <verse number="1183">Psalm 77:12	and I will meditate on all your works. And I will take part in your intentions.</verse>
  <verse number="1184">Psalm 77:13	Your way, O God, is in what is holy. Which God is great like our God?</verse>
  <verse number="1185">Psalm 77:14	You are the God who performs miracles. You have made your virtue known among the peoples.</verse>
  <verse number="1186">Psalm 77:15	With your arm, you have redeemed your people, the sons of Jacob and of Joseph.</verse>
  <verse number="1187">Psalm 77:16	The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you, and they were afraid, and the depths were stirred up.</verse>
  <verse number="1188">Psalm 77:17	Great was the sound of the waters. The clouds uttered a voice. For your arrows also pass by.</verse>
  <verse number="1189">Psalm 77:18	The voice of your thunder is like a wheel. Your flashes have illuminated the whole world. The earth has quaked and trembled.</verse>
  <verse number="1190">Psalm 77:19	Your way is through the sea, and your paths are through many waters. And your traces will not be known.</verse>
  <verse number="1191">Psalm 77:20	You have conducted your people like sheep, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</verse>
  <verse number="1192">Psalm 78:1	The understanding of Asaph. O my people, attend to my law. Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="1193">Psalm 78:2	I will open my mouth in parables. I will speak about concepts that are from the beginning.</verse>
  <verse number="1194">Psalm 78:3	We have heard and known such great things, as our fathers have described to us.</verse>
  <verse number="1195">Psalm 78:4	These things have not been hidden from their sons in any generation: declaring the praises of the Lord, and his virtues, and the wonders that he has done.</verse>
  <verse number="1196">Psalm 78:5	And he has received testimony with Jacob, and he has set a law within Israel. Such great things, he has commanded our fathers, so as to make these things known to their sons,</verse>
  <verse number="1197">Psalm 78:6	so that another generation might know them, and so that the sons, who will be born and who will grow up, shall describe them to their sons.</verse>
  <verse number="1198">Psalm 78:7	So then, may they put their hope in God, and may they not forget the works of God, and may they seek his commandments.</verse>
  <verse number="1199">Psalm 78:8	May they not become like their fathers, a perverse and exasperating generation: a generation that does not straighten their heart and whose spirit is not trustworthy with God.</verse>
  <verse number="1200">Psalm 78:9	The sons of Ephraim, who bend and shoot the bow, have been turned back in the day of battle.</verse>
  <verse number="1201">Psalm 78:10	They have not kept the covenant of God. And they were not willing to walk in his law.</verse>
  <verse number="1202">Psalm 78:11	And they have been forgetful of his benefits, and of his miracle, which he revealed to them.</verse>
  <verse number="1203">Psalm 78:12	He performed miracles in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis.</verse>
  <verse number="1204">Psalm 78:13	He broke the sea and he led them through. And he stationed the waters, as if in a vessel.</verse>
  <verse number="1205">Psalm 78:14	And he led them with a cloud by day, and with illumination by fire throughout the night.</verse>
  <verse number="1206">Psalm 78:15	He broke through the rock in the wasteland, and he gave them to drink, as if from the great abyss.</verse>
  <verse number="1207">Psalm 78:16	He brought forth water from the rock, and he conducted the waters, as if they were rivers.</verse>
  <verse number="1208">Psalm 78:17	And yet, they continued to sin against him. In a waterless place, they provoked the Most High with resentment.</verse>
  <verse number="1209">Psalm 78:18	And they tempted God in their hearts, by asking for food according to their desires.</verse>
  <verse number="1210">Psalm 78:19	And they spoke badly about God. They said, “Would God be able to prepare a table in the desert?</verse>
  <verse number="1211">Psalm 78:20	He struck the rock, and so waters flowed and the torrents flooded, but would even he be able to provide bread, or provide a table, for his people?”</verse>
  <verse number="1212">Psalm 78:21	Therefore, the Lord heard, and he was dismayed, and a fire was kindled within Jacob, and an anger ascended into Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="1213">Psalm 78:22	For they neither put their trust in God, nor did they hope in his salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="1214">Psalm 78:23	And he commanded the clouds from above, and he opened the doors of heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="1215">Psalm 78:24	And he rained down manna upon them to eat, and he gave them the bread of heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="1216">Psalm 78:25	Man ate the bread of Angels. He sent them provisions in abundance.</verse>
  <verse number="1217">Psalm 78:26	He transferred the south wind from heaven, and, in his virtue, he brought in the Southwest wind.</verse>
  <verse number="1218">Psalm 78:27	And he rained down flesh upon them, as if it were dust, and feathered birds, as if they were the sand of the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="1219">Psalm 78:28	And they fell down in the midst of their camp, encircling their tabernacles.</verse>
  <verse number="1220">Psalm 78:29	And they ate until they were greatly satisfied, and he brought to them according to their desires.</verse>
  <verse number="1221">Psalm 78:30	They were not cheated out of what they wanted. Their food was still in their mouth,</verse>
  <verse number="1222">Psalm 78:31	and then the wrath of God came upon them. And he slew the fat ones among them, and he impeded the elect of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="1223">Psalm 78:32	In all these things, they continued to sin, and they were not trustworthy with his miracles.</verse>
  <verse number="1224">Psalm 78:33	And their days faded away into vanity, and their years with haste.</verse>
  <verse number="1225">Psalm 78:34	When he slew them, then they sought him. And they returned, and they drew near to him in the early morning.</verse>
  <verse number="1226">Psalm 78:35	And they were mindful that God is their helper and that the Most High God is their redeemer.</verse>
  <verse number="1227">Psalm 78:36	And they chose him with their mouth, and then they lied to him with their tongue.</verse>
  <verse number="1228">Psalm 78:37	For their heart was not upright with him, nor have they been living faithfully in his covenant.</verse>
  <verse number="1229">Psalm 78:38	Yet he is merciful, and he will pardon their sins. And he will not destroy them. And he has abundantly turned aside his own wrath. And he did not enflame his wrath entirely.</verse>
  <verse number="1230">Psalm 78:39	And he remembered that they are flesh: with a spirit that goes forth and does not return.</verse>
  <verse number="1231">Psalm 78:40	How often did they provoke him in the desert and stir him to wrath in a waterless place?</verse>
  <verse number="1232">Psalm 78:41	And they turned back and tempted God, and they exasperated the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="1233">Psalm 78:42	They did not remember his hand, in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of the one troubling them.</verse>
  <verse number="1234">Psalm 78:43	Thus, he positioned his signs in Egypt and his wonders in the field of Tanis.</verse>
  <verse number="1235">Psalm 78:44	And he turned their rivers into blood, along with their rain showers, so that they could not drink.</verse>
  <verse number="1236">Psalm 78:45	He sent among them the common fly, and it devoured them, and the frog, and it scattered them.</verse>
  <verse number="1237">Psalm 78:46	And he gave up their fruits to mold and their labors to the locust.</verse>
  <verse number="1238">Psalm 78:47	And he slew their vineyards with hail and their mulberry trees with severe frost.</verse>
  <verse number="1239">Psalm 78:48	And he delivered their cattle to the hail and their possessions to fire.</verse>
  <verse number="1240">Psalm 78:49	And he sent the wrath of his indignation among them: indignation and wrath and tribulation, sent forth by evil angels.</verse>
  <verse number="1241">Psalm 78:50	He made way for the path of his anger. He did not spare their souls from death. And he enclosed their beasts of burden in death.</verse>
  <verse number="1242">Psalm 78:51	And he struck all the first-born in the land of Egypt: the first-fruits of all their labor in the tabernacles of Ham.</verse>
  <verse number="1243">Psalm 78:52	And he took away his own people like sheep, and he led them through the wilderness like a flock.</verse>
  <verse number="1244">Psalm 78:53	And he led them out in hope, and they did not fear. And the sea covered their enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="1245">Psalm 78:54	And he led them to the mountain of his sanctification: the mountain that his right hand had acquired. And he cast out the Gentiles before their face. And he divided their land by lot to them, with a line of distribution.</verse>
  <verse number="1246">Psalm 78:55	And he caused the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles.</verse>
  <verse number="1247">Psalm 78:56	Yet they tempted and aggravated God Most High, and they did not keep his testaments.</verse>
  <verse number="1248">Psalm 78:57	And they turned themselves aside, and they did not serve the covenant. In the same manner as their fathers, they were turned backwards, like a crooked bow.</verse>
  <verse number="1249">Psalm 78:58	They impelled him to anger on their hills, and they provoked him to rivalry with their graven images.</verse>
  <verse number="1250">Psalm 78:59	God listened, and he spurned them, and he reduced Israel greatly, almost to nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="1251">Psalm 78:60	And he rejected the tabernacle of Shiloh, his tabernacle where he had dwelt among men.</verse>
  <verse number="1252">Psalm 78:61	And he delivered their virtue into captivity, and their beauty into the hands of the enemy.</verse>
  <verse number="1253">Psalm 78:62	And he enclosed his people with the sword, and he spurned his inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="1254">Psalm 78:63	Fire consumed their young men, and their virgins were not lamented.</verse>
  <verse number="1255">Psalm 78:64	Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows did not weep.</verse>
  <verse number="1256">Psalm 78:65	And the Lord was awaked, as if out of sleep, and like a powerful man impaired by wine.</verse>
  <verse number="1257">Psalm 78:66	And he struck his enemies on the back. He gave them over to everlasting disgrace.</verse>
  <verse number="1258">Psalm 78:67	And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, and he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim.</verse>
  <verse number="1259">Psalm 78:68	But he chose the tribe of Judah: mount Zion, which he loved.</verse>
  <verse number="1260">Psalm 78:69	And he built up his sanctuary, like a single-horned beast, in the land that he founded for all ages.</verse>
  <verse number="1261">Psalm 78:70	And he chose his servant David, and he took him from the flocks of the sheep: he received him from following the ewes with their young,</verse>
  <verse number="1262">Psalm 78:71	in order to pasture Jacob his servant and Israel his inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="1263">Psalm 78:72	And he fed them with the innocence of his heart. And he led them with the understanding of his hands.</verse>
  <verse number="1264">Psalm 79:1	A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the Gentiles have entered into your inheritance; they have polluted your holy temple. They have set Jerusalem as a place to tend fruit trees.</verse>
  <verse number="1265">Psalm 79:2	They have placed the dead bodies of your servants as food for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your saints for the beasts of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="1266">Psalm 79:3	They have poured out their blood like water all around Jerusalem, and there was no one who would bury them.</verse>
  <verse number="1267">Psalm 79:4	We have become a disgrace to our neighbors, an object of ridicule and mockery to those who are around us.</verse>
