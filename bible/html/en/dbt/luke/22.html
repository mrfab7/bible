<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now the feast of unleavened bread, which [is] called the passover, drew nigh,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Satan entered into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariote, being of the number of the twelve.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he went away and spoke with the chief priests and captains as to how he should deliver him up to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And they were rejoiced, and agreed to give him money.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he came to an agreement to do it, and sought an opportunity to deliver him up to them away from the crowd.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the day of unleavened bread came, in which the passover was to be killed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare the passover for us, that we may eat [it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But they said to him, Where wilt thou that we prepare [it]?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he said to them, Behold, as ye enter into the city a man will meet you, carrying an earthen pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he goes in;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and ye shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher says to thee, Where is the guest-chamber where I may eat the passover with my disciples?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And he will shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And having gone they found it as he had said to them; and they prepared the passover.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And when the hour was come, he placed himself at table, and the [twelve] apostles with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he said to them, With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For I say unto you, that I will not eat any more at all of it until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And having received a cup, when he had given thanks he said, Take this and divide it among yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For I say unto you, that I will not drink at all of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And having taken a loaf, when he had given thanks, he broke [it], and gave [it] to them, saying, This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In like manner also the cup, after having supped, saying, This cup [is] the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Moreover, behold, the hand of him that delivers me up [is] with me on the table;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">and the Son of man indeed goes as it is determined, but woe unto that man by whom he is delivered up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And they began to question together among themselves who then it could be of them who was about to do this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And there was also a strife among them which of them should be held to be [the] greatest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And he said to them, The kings of the nations rule over them, and they that exercise authority over them are called benefactors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But ye [shall] not [be] thus; but let the greater among you be as the younger, and the leader as he that serves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For which [is] greater, he that is at table or he that serves? [Is] not he that is at table? But I am in the midst of you as the one that serves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">But ye are they who have persevered with me in my temptations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And I appoint unto you, as my Father has appointed unto me, a kingdom,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded to have you, to sift [you] as wheat;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">but I have besought for thee that thy faith fail not; and thou, when once thou hast been restored, confirm thy brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And he said to him, Lord, with thee I am ready to go both to prison and to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And he said, I tell thee, Peter, [the] cock shall not crow to-day before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And he said to them, When I sent you without purse and scrip and sandals, did ye lack anything? And they said, Nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">He said therefore to them, But now he that has a purse let him take [it], in like manner also a scrip, and he that has none let him sell his garment and buy a sword;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">for I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned with [the] lawless: for also the things concerning me have an end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And they said, Lord, behold here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And going forth he went according to his custom to the mount of Olives, and the disciples also followed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And when he was at the place he said to them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And he was withdrawn from them about a stone’s throw, and having knelt down he prayed,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">saying, Father, if thou wilt remove this cup from me:—but then, not my will, but thine be done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And an angel appeared to him from heaven strengthening him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And being in conflict he prayed more intently. And his sweat became as great drops of blood, falling down upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">And rising up from his prayer, coming to the disciples, he found them sleeping from grief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">And he said to them, Why sleep ye? rise up and pray that ye enter not into temptation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">As he was yet speaking, behold, a crowd, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went on before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">And Jesus said to him, Judas, deliverest thou up the Son of man with a kiss?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">And they who were around him, seeing what was going to follow, said [to him], Lord, shall we smite with [the] sword?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">And a certain one from among them smote the bondman of the high priest and took off his right ear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">And Jesus answering said, Suffer thus far; and having touched his ear, he healed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">And Jesus said to the chief priests and captains of the temple and elders, who were come against him, Have ye come out as against a robber with swords and sticks?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">When I was day by day with you in the temple ye did not stretch out your hands against me; but this is your hour and the power of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">And having laid hold on him, they led him [away], and they led [him] into the house of the high priest. And Peter followed afar off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">And they having lit a fire in the midst of the court and sat down together, Peter sat among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">And a certain maid, having seen him sitting by the light, and having fixed her eyes upon him, said, And this [man] was with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="57">But he denied [him], saying, Woman, I do not know him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="58">And after a short time another seeing him said, And thou art of them. But Peter said, Man, I am not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="59">And after the lapse of about one hour another stoutly maintained it, saying, In truth this [man] also was with him, for also he is a Galilaean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="60">And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he was yet speaking, [the] cock crew.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="61">And the Lord, turning round, looked at Peter; and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him, Before [the] cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="62">And Peter, going forth without, wept bitterly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="63">And the men who held him mocked him, beating [him];</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="64">and covering him up, asked him saying, Prophesy, who is it that struck thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="65">And they said many other injurious things to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="66">And when it was day, the elderhood of the people, both [the] chief priests and scribes, were gathered together, and led him into their council, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="67">If thou art the Christ, tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye will not at all believe;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="68">and if I should ask [you], ye would not answer me at all, nor let me go;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="69">but henceforth shall the Son of man be sitting on the right hand of the power of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="70">And they all said, Thou then art the Son of God? And he said to them, Ye say that I am.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="71">And they said, What need have we any more of witness, for we have heard ourselves out of his mouth?</p>
