<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Let every soul be placed under the protecting powers. For there is no power except from God: and the powers being, were ordered by God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">So he opposing the power, has resisted the arrangement of God: and they having resisted shall receive to themselves judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For rulers are not the terror of good works, but of evil. And wilt thou not fear the power do good, and thou shalt have approbation of it:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For he is servant of God to thee for good. And if thou do evil, be afraid; for he bears not the sword without order: for he is servant of God, avenging for anger to him doing evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Wherefore necessity to be placed under, not only for anger, but also for consciousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For this also pay ye taxes: for they are workmen of God, persevering in this same.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Therefore restore debts to all; to whom tribute, tribute; to whom recompense, recompense; to whom fear, fear; to whom honour, honour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Owe ye nothing to none, except to love one another: for he loving another has completed the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false testimony, Thou shalt not covet; and if any other command in this word it is summed up, in it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Love works no evil to the neighbor: love therefore the completion of the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And this, knowing the time, that already the hour ye should be awakened out of sleep: for now our salvation nearer than when we believed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The night has advanced, and the day has drawn near: therefore let us lay down the works of darkness, and put on the weapons of light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">As in the day, let us walk becomingly; not in revelries and drunkenness, not in coition and licentiousness, not in strife and envy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not consideration for the flesh, for the passions.</p>
