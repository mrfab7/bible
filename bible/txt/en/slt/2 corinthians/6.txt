1	And working together, we also beseech, lest also ye receive the grace of God in vain.
2	(For he says, In an acceptable time I listened to thee, and in the day of salvation have I run to succor thee: behold, now the acceptable time; behold; now the day of salvation.)
3	Giving no offence in any thing, that the service be not blamed:
4	But in every thing recommending ourselves as servants of God, in much patience, in pressures, in necessities, in extremities,
5	In blows, in imprisonments, in disorders, in fatigues, in watchings, in fastings;
6	In purity, in knowledge, in long suffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in love unfeigned.
7	In the word of truth, in the power of God, through the weapons of justice of the right hands and the left,
8	Through glory and ignominy, through slander and applause: as erring, and true;
9	As being ignorant, and knowing; as dying, and, behold, we live; as being disciplined, and not killed;
10	As being grieved, and always rejoicing; as poor, and making many rich; as having nothing, and possessing all things.
11	Our month stands open to you, O Corinthians, our heart has been enlarged.
12	Ye are not contracted in us, but ye are contracted in your bowels.
13	And for the same recompense, (I speak as to children,) be ye yourselves also enlarged.
14	Be not unequally yoked together with the unbelieving: for what participation to justice and iniquity and what communion to light with darkness?
15	And what conformity to Christ with Belial? and what part to the believing with the unbelieving?
16	And what agreement to the temple of God with images? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God said, That I will dwell in them, and will go round about; and will be their God, and they shall be a people to me.
17	Therefore come out from the midst of them, and be separated, says the Lord, and touch not the unclean; and I will receive you.
18	And I will be to you for a Father, and ye shall be to me for sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.
