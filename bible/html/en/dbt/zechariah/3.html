<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the Angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Jehovah said unto Satan, Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan! Yea, Jehovah that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee! Is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the Angel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he spoke and said unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from off him. And unto him he said, See, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I clothe thee with festival-robes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And I said, Let them set a pure turban upon his head. And they set the pure turban upon his head, and clothed him with garments; and the Angel of Jehovah stood by.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the Angel of Jehovah protested unto Joshua, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts; and I will give thee a place to walk among these that stand by.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Hear now, Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee—for they are men of portent—for behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For behold, the stone that I have laid before Joshua—upon one stone are seven eyes; behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of this land in one day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, shall ye invite every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig-tree.</p>
