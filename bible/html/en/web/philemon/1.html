<div class="chapter" data-book="Philemon" data-chapter="1" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow worker,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">to the beloved Apphia, to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the assembly in your house:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I thank my God always, making mention of you in my prayers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">hearing of your love, and of the faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in us in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For we have much joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Therefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to command you that which is appropriate,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">yet for loveâ€™s sake I rather beg, being such a one as Paul, the aged, but also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I beg you for my child, whom I have become the father of in my chains, Onesimus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">who once was useless to you, but now is useful to you and to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I am sending him back. Therefore receive him, that is, my own heart,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">whom I desired to keep with me, that on your behalf he might serve me in my chains for the Good News.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But I was willing to do nothing without your consent, that your goodness would not be as of necessity, but of free will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For perhaps he was therefore separated from you for a while, that you would have him forever,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, but how much rather to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If then you count me a partner, receive him as you would receive me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But if he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, put that to my account.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it (not to mention to you that you owe to me even your own self besides).</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Yes, brother, let me have joy from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Having confidence in your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even beyond what I say.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Also, prepare a guest room for me, for I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, greets you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
