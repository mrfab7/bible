<chapter book="1 Timothy" number="5" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father; and the younger men as brothers;</verse>
  <verse number="2">The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Honor widows that are widows indeed.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusts in God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But she that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Let not a widow be taken into the number under three score years old, having been the wife of one man.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;</verse>
  <verse number="12">Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And with they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For some are already turned aside after Satan.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If any man or woman that believes have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For the scripture said, You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the corn. And, The laborer is worthy of his reward.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear.</verse>
  <verse number="21">I charge you before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins: keep yourself pure.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for your stomach’s sake and your often infirmities.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Some men’s sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.</verse>
