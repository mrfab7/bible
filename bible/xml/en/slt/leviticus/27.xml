  <verse number="3">And thy estimation was the male of the son of twenty years, and even to the son of sixty years; and thy estimation was fifty shekels of silver by the shekel of the holy place.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And if it is a female, thy estimation was thirty shekels.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And if from the son of five years, and even to the son of twenty years, and thy estimation was, the male, twenty shekels, and for the female, ten shekels.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And if from the son of a month, and even to the son of five years, and thy estimation was, the male, five shekels of silver, and for the female, thy estimation, three shekels of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And if from the son of sixty years and from above, if a male, thy estimation was fifteen shekels, and for a female, ten shekels.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And if he was poor above thy estimation, and he stood before the priest, and the priest estimated him: and according to whose mouth the hand shall attain, the priest estimated him vowing.</verse>

  <verse number="21">And the field in its going forth in the jubilee was holy to Jehovah, as a consecrated field: to the priest shall be its possession.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And if the field of his purchase which is not from the field of his possession he shall consecrate to Jehovah;</verse>
  <verse number="23">And the priest reckoned to him the number of thy estimation till the year of jubilee: and he gave thy estimation in that day, holy to Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="24">In the year of the jubilee the field shall return to whom they bought it from him, to him to whom the possession of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And all thy estimation shall be according to the holy shekel: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</verse>
  <verse number="26">But the first-born which shall be first to Jehovah among the cattle, a man shall not consecrate it; if an ox, if a sheep, it is to Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And if from unclean cattle, and he redeemed by thy estimation, and he shall add the fifth upon it: and if it shall not be redeemed, and it was sold by thy estimation.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But all consecrated which a man shall consecrate to Jehovah from all which is to him, from man and cattle, and from the field of his possession, shall not be sold and shall not be redeemed: every thing consecrated it is holy of holies to Jehovah.</verse>
