<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Thus saith Jehovah to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him—and I will loose the loins of kings; to open before him the two-leaved doors, and the gates shall not be shut:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I will go before thee, and make the elevated places plain; I will break in pieces the brazen doors, and cut asunder the bars of iron;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places; that thou mayest know that I, Jehovah, who call thee by name, [am] the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For Jacob my servant’s sake, and Israel mine elect, I have called thee by thy name; I surnamed thee, though thou didst not know me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I [am] Jehovah, and there is none else; there is no God beside me: I girded thee, and thou hast not known me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">—that they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the going down, that there is none beside me. I [am] Jehovah, and there is none else;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">forming the light and creating darkness, making peace and creating evil: I, Jehovah, do all these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Drop down, [ye] heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness; let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and with it let righteousness spring up. I, Jehovah, have created it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let a potsherd [strive] with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that formeth it, What makest thou? Or thy work, He hath no hands?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Woe unto him that saith unto [his] father, What begettest thou? Or to [his] mother, What hast thou brought forth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Thus saith Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker: Ask me of the things to come; concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands, command ye me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">It is I that have made the earth, and created man upon it; it is I, my hands, that have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">It is I that have raised him up in righteousness, and I will make all his ways straight: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith Jehovah of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thus saith Jehovah: The wealth of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall walk after thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall bow down unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, [saying,] Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, no other God....</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel, the Saviour....</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them; they shall go away in confusion together, the makers of idols.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Israel shall be saved by Jehovah with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded, unto the ages of ages.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For thus saith Jehovah who created the heavens, God himself who formed the earth and made it, he who established it,—not as waste did he create it: he formed it to be inhabited:—I [am] Jehovah, and there is none else.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth; I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek me in vain: I [am] Jehovah, speaking righteousness, declaring things which are right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Gather yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are escaped of the nations. They have no knowledge that carry the wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot save.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Declare and bring [them] near; yea, let them take counsel together: who hath caused this to be heard from ancient time? [who] hath declared it long ago? Is it not I, Jehovah? And there is no God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour, there is none besides me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I [am] God, and there is none else.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth [in] righteousness and shall not return, that unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Only in Jehovah, shall one say, have I righteousness and strength. To him shall [men] come; and all that are incensed against him shall be ashamed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">In Jehovah shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and shall glory.</p>
