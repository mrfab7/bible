  <verse number="1">WHAT shall we say then that Abraham hath found, who is our father according to the flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Now to him that worketh, the reward is not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But to him that worketh not, yet believeth in him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reputed to justice, according to the purpose of the grace of God.</verse>
  <verse number="6">As David also termeth the blessedness of a man, to whom God reputeth justice without works:</verse>
  <verse number="7">Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin.</verse>
  <verse number="9">This blessedness then, doth it remain in the circumcision only, or in the uncircumcision also? For we say that unto Abraham faith was reputed to justice.</verse>
  <verse number="10">How then was it reputed? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the justice of the faith, which he had, being uncircumcised; that he might be the father of all them that believe, being uncircumcised, that unto them also it may be reputed to justice:</verse>
  <verse number="12">And might be the father of circumcision; not to them only, that are of the circumcision, but to them also that follow the steps of the faithful, that is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For not through the law was the promise to Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be heir of the world; but through the justice of faith.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For if they who are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, the promise is made of no effect.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For the law worketh wrath. For where there is no law, neither is there transgression.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore is it of faith, that according to grace the promise might be firm to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,</verse>
  <verse number="17">(As it is written: I have made thee a father of many nations,) before God, whom he believed, who quickeneth the dead; and calleth those things that are not, as those that are.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Who against hope believed in hope; that he might be made the father of many nations, according to that which was said to him: So shall thy seed be.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And he was not weak in faith; neither did he consider his own body now dead, whereas he was almost an hundred years old, nor the dead womb of Sara.</verse>
  <verse number="20">In the promise also of God he staggered not by distrust; but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God:</verse>
  <verse number="21">Most fully knowing, that whatsoever he has promised, he is able also to perform.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And therefore it was reputed to him unto justice.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Now it is not written only for him, that it was reputed to him unto justice,</verse>
  <verse number="24">But also for us, to whom it shall be reputed, if we believe in him, that raised up Jesus Christ, our Lord, from the dead,</verse>
  <verse number="25">Who was delivered up for our sins, and rose again for our justification.</verse>
