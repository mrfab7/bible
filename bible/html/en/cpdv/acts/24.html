<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then, after five days, the high priest Ananias came down with some of the elders and a certain Tertullus, a speaker. And they went to the governor against Paul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And having summoned Paul, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying: “Most excellent Felix, since we have much peace through you, and many things may be corrected by your providence,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">we acknowledge this, always and everywhere, with acts of thanksgiving for everything.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But lest I speak at too great a length, I beg you, by your clemency, to listen to us briefly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">We have found this man to be pestilent, to be inciting seditions among all the Jews in the entire world, and to be the author of the sedition of the sect of the Nazarenes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he has even been attempting to violate the temple. And having apprehended him, we wanted him to be judged according to our law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But Lysias, the tribune, overwhelming us with great violence, snatched him away from our hands,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">ordering his accusers to come to you. From them, you yourself will be able, by judging about all these things, to understand the reason that we accuse him.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And then the Jews interjected, saying that these things were so.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then, since the governor had motioned for him to speak, Paul responded: “Knowing that you have been the judge over this nation for many years, I will give an explanation of myself with an honest soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For, as you may realize, it has only been twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And they did not find me in the temple arguing with anyone, nor causing a rally of the people: neither in the synagogues, nor in the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And they are not able to prove to you the things about which they now accuse me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But I confess this to you, that according to that sect, which they call a heresy, so do I serve my God and Father, believing all that is written in the Law and the Prophets,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">having a hope in God, which these others themselves also expect, that there will be a future resurrection of the just and the unjust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And in this, I myself always strive to have a conscience that is lacking in any offence toward God and toward men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Then, after many years, I went to my nation, bringing alms and offerings and vows,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">through which I obtained purification in the temple: neither with a crowd, nor with a commotion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But certain Jews out of Asia are the ones who should have appeared before you to accuse me, if they have anything against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Or let these ones here say if they have found in me any iniquity, while standing before the council.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For while standing among them, I spoke out solely about this one matter: about the resurrection of the dead. It is about this that I am being judged today by you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Then Felix, after having ascertained much knowledge about this Way, kept them waiting, by saying, “When Lysias the tribune has arrived, I will give you a hearing.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he ordered a centurion to guard him, and to take rest, and not to prohibit any of his own from ministering to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Then, after some days, Felix, arriving with his wife Drusilla who was a Jew, called for Paul and listened to him about the faith that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And after he discoursed about justice and chastity, and about the future judgment, Felix was trembling, and he responded: “For now, go, but remain under guard. Then, at an opportune time, I will summon you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He was also hoping that money might be given to him by Paul, and because of this, he frequently summoned him and spoke with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Then, when two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Portius Festus. And since Felix wanted to show particular favor to the Jews, he left Paul behind as a prisoner.</p>
