  <verse number="1">And Job, responding, said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Truly, I know that it is so, and that man cannot be justified compared with God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">If he chooses to contend with him, he is not able to respond to him once out of a thousand times.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He is understanding in heart and mighty in strength; who has resisted him and yet had peace?</verse>
  <verse number="5">He has moved mountains, and those whom he overthrew in his fury did not know it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He shakes the earth out of its place and its pillars tremble.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He commands the sun and it does not rise, and he closes the stars as if under a seal.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He alone extends the heavens, and he walks upon the waves of the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He fashions Arcturus, and Orion, and Hyades, and the interior of the south.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He accomplishes great and incomprehensible and miraculous things, which cannot be numbered.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If he approaches me, I will not see him; if he departs, I will not understand.</verse>
  <verse number="12">If he suddenly should question, who will answer him? Or who can say, “Why did you do so?”</verse>
  <verse number="13">God, whose wrath no one is able to resist, and under whom they bend who carry the world,</verse>
  <verse number="14">what am I then, that I should answer him and exchange words with him?</verse>
  <verse number="15">And if I now have any justice, I will not respond, but will beseech my judge.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And if he should listen to me when I call, I would not believe that he had heard my voice.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For he will crush me in a whirlwind and multiply my wounds, even without cause.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He does not permit my spirit to rest, and he fills me with bitterness.</verse>
  <verse number="19">If strength is sought, he is most strong; if equity in judgment, no one would dare to give testimony for me.</verse>
  <verse number="20">If I wanted to justify myself, my own mouth will condemn me; if I would reveal my innocence, he would prove me depraved.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And if I now became simple, my soul would be ignorant even of this, and my life would weary me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">There is one thing that I have said: both the innocent and the impious he consumes.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If he scourges, let him kill all at once, and not laugh at the punishment of the innocent.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Since the earth has been given into the hand of the impious, he covers the face of its judges; for if it is not him, then who is it?</verse>
  <verse number="25">My days have been swifter than a messenger; they have fled and have not seen goodness.</verse>
  <verse number="26">They have passed by like ships carrying fruits, just like an eagle flying to food.</verse>
  <verse number="27">If I say: “By no means will I speak this way.” I change my face and I am tortured with sorrow.</verse>
  <verse number="28">I have dreaded all my works, knowing that you did not spare the offender.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Yet, if I am also just as impious, why have I labored in vain?</verse>
  <verse number="30">If I had been washed with snow-like waters, and my hands were shining like the cleanest thing,</verse>
  <verse number="31">yet you would plunge me in filth, and my own garments would abhor me.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For even I would not answer a man who were like myself, nor one who could be heard with me equally in judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="33">There is no one who could both prevail in argument and in placing his hand between the two.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Let him take his staff away from me, and let not the fear of him terrify me.</verse>
  <verse number="35">I will speak and I will not fear him, for in fearfulness I am not able to respond.</verse>
