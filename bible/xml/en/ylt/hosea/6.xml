  <verse number="1">‘Come, and we turn back unto Jehovah, For He hath torn, and He doth heal us, He doth smite, and He bindeth us up.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He doth revive us after two days, In the third day He doth raise us up, And we live before Him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And we know—we pursue to know Jehovah, As the dawn prepared is His going forth, And He cometh in as a shower to us, As gathered rain—sprinkling earth.’</verse>
  <verse number="4">What do I do to thee, O Ephraim? What do I do to thee, O Judah? Your goodness is as a cloud of the morning, And as dew rising early—going.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Therefore I have hewed by prophets, I have slain them by sayings of My mouth, And My judgments to the light goeth forth.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For kindness I desired, and not sacrifice, And a knowledge of God above burnt-offerings.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they, as Adam, transgressed a covenant, There they dealt treacherously against me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Gilead is a city of workers of iniquity, Slippery from blood.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And as bands do wait for a man, A company of priests do murder—the way to Shechem, For wickedness they have done.</verse>
  <verse number="10">In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing, There is the whoredom of Ephraim—defiled is Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Also, O Judah, appointed is a harvest to thee, In My turning back to the captivity of My people!</verse>
