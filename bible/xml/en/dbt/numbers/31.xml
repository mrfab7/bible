  <verse number="1">And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Avenge the children of Israel upon the Midianites; afterwards shalt thou be gathered unto thy peoples.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm from amongst you men for military service, that they go against Midian to execute Jehovah’s vengeance upon Midian.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Of every tribe a thousand, of all the tribes of Israel, shall ye send to the war.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And there were levied out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand by tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand by the tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, and the holy instruments, even the alarm-trumpets in his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they warred against Midian, as Jehovah had commanded Moses, and slew all the males.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And they slew the kings of Midian, besides the others slain, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian; and Balaam the son of Beor they slew with the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the children of Israel took the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took for a spoil all their cattle and all their flocks and all their goods;</verse>
  <verse number="10">and all their cities in their settlements and all their encampments they burned with fire.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And they took all the booty, and all the prey, of man and of cattle;</verse>
  <verse number="12">and they brought to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and to the assembly of the children of Israel, the captives and the prey and the booty, to the camp in the plains of Moab, which are by the Jordan of Jericho.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the princes of the assembly went forth to meet them outside the camp.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Moses was wroth with the officers of the army, with the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, who came from the service of the war;</verse>
  <verse number="15">and Moses said to them, Have ye saved all the women alive?</verse>
  <verse number="16">Lo, these, through the counsel of Balaam, caused the children of Israel to commit sin against Jehovah in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague on the assembly of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And now slay every male among the little ones, and slay every woman that hath known man by lying with him,</verse>
  <verse number="18">but all the children among the women that have not known lying with a man, keep alive for yourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And encamp outside the camp seven days; whoever hath killed a person, and whoever hath touched any slain; ye shall purify yourselves on the third day, and on the seventh day, you and your captives.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And every garment, and every vessel of skin, and all work of goat’s hair, and every utensil of wood shall ye purify.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war that had gone to the battle, This is the statute of the law which Jehovah hath commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Only the gold, and the silver, the copper, the iron, the tin, and the lead,</verse>
  <verse number="23">everything that passeth through the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean; only it shall be purified with the water of separation; and everything that cannot pass through the fire ye shall make go through the water.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And ye shall wash your garments on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean; and afterwards ye may come into the camp.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="26">Take the sum of the prey that was taken, of man and of cattle, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the assembly;</verse>
  <verse number="27">and divide the prey into halves, between them that conducted the war, who went out to the battle, and the whole assembly.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And thou shalt levy a tribute for Jehovah of the men of war who went out to the army, one soul of five hundred of the persons, and of the oxen, and of the asses, and of the small cattle.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Of their half shall ye take it, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for a heave-offering of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And of the children of Israel’s half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the oxen, of the asses, and of the small cattle, of every [kind of] beasts, and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, who keep the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And the prey, the rest of the spoil, which the men of war had taken, was six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep,</verse>
  <verse number="33">and seventy-two thousand oxen,</verse>
  <verse number="34">and sixty-one thousand asses,</verse>
  <verse number="35">and of human persons, of the women that had not known lying with a man, all the persons were thirty-two thousand.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And the half, the portion of them that had gone out to the war, was in number three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep,</verse>
  <verse number="37">and the tribute for Jehovah of the sheep was six hundred and seventy-five;</verse>
  <verse number="38">and the oxen were thirty-six thousand, and the tribute thereof for Jehovah, seventy-two;</verse>
  <verse number="39">and the asses were thirty thousand five hundred, and the tribute thereof for Jehovah, sixty-one;</verse>
  <verse number="40">and the human persons were sixteen thousand, of whom the tribute for Jehovah was thirty-two persons.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And Moses gave the tribute of Jehovah’s heave-offering to Eleazar the priest, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses had divided, [taking it] from the men that served in the war,</verse>
  <verse number="43">(now the half belonging to the assembly was of the sheep, three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred,</verse>
  <verse number="44">and thirty-six thousand oxen,</verse>
  <verse number="45">and thirty thousand five hundred asses,</verse>
  <verse number="46">and sixteen thousand human persons,)</verse>
  <verse number="47">... of the children of Israel’s half, Moses took one portion of fifty, of man and of cattle, and gave them to the Levites who kept the charge of the tabernacle of Jehovah; as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And the officers who were over the thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near to Moses,</verse>
  <verse number="49">and they said to Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war who were under our hand, and there is not one man of us lacking.</verse>
  <verse number="50">So we present the offering of Jehovah, that which each one hath found, jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces, to make atonement for our souls before Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="51">And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, all manner of wrought jewels.</verse>
  <verse number="52">And all the gold of the heave-offering that they offered to Jehovah was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels, from the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds.</verse>
  <verse number="53">(The men of war had taken spoil each one for himself.)</verse>
  <verse number="54">And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting, as a memorial for the children of Israel before Jehovah.</verse>
