<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I commanded the assemblies of Galatia, you do likewise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">On the first day of the week, let each one of you save, as he may prosper, that no collections be made when I come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">When I arrive, I will send whoever you approve with letters to carry your gracious gift to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If it is appropriate for me to go also, they will go with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But I will come to you when I have passed through Macedonia, for I am passing through Macedonia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But with you it may be that I will stay, or even winter, that you may send me on my journey wherever I go.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For I do not wish to see you now in passing, but I hope to stay a while with you, if the Lord permits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">for a great and effective door has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Now if Timothy comes, see that he is with you without fear, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Therefore let no one despise him. But set him forward on his journey in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now concerning Apollos, the brother, I strongly urged him to come to you with the brothers; and it was not at all his desire to come now; but he will come when he has an opportunity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Watch! Stand firm in the faith! Be courageous! Be strong!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Let all that you do be done in love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Now I beg you, brothers (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to serve the saints),</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">that you also be in subjection to such, and to everyone who helps in the work and labors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for that which was lacking on your part, they supplied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For they refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore acknowledge those who are like that.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The assemblies of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you much in the Lord, together with the assembly that is in their house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">This greeting is by me, Paul, with my own hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">If any man doesnâ€™t love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be accursed. Come, Lord!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
