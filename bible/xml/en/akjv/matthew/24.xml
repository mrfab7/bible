  <verse number="1">And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Jesus said to them, See you not all these things? truly I say to you, There shall not be left here one stone on another, that shall not be thrown down.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the world?</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Jesus answered and said to them, Take heed that no man deceive you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars: see that you be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.</verse>
  <verse number="8">All these are the beginning of sorrows.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and you shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness to all nations; and then shall the end come.</verse>
  <verse number="15">When you therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoever reads, let him understand:)</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:</verse>
  <verse number="17">Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:</verse>
  <verse number="18">Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!</verse>
  <verse number="20">But pray you that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:</verse>
  <verse number="21">For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Then if any man shall say to you, See, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; so that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Behold, I have told you before.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Why if they shall say to you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For as the lightning comes out of the east, and shines even to the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</verse>
  <verse number="28">For wherever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:</verse>
  <verse number="30">And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near:</verse>
  <verse number="33">So likewise you, when you shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Truly I say to you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.</verse>
  <verse number="36">But of that day and hour knows no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.</verse>
  <verse number="37">But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</verse>
  <verse number="38">For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark,</verse>
  <verse number="39">And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</verse>
  <verse number="40">Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</verse>
  <verse number="42">Watch therefore: for you know not what hour your Lord does come.</verse>
  <verse number="43">But know this, that if the manager of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Therefore be you also ready: for in such an hour as you think not the Son of man comes.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?</verse>
  <verse number="46">Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he comes shall find so doing.</verse>
  <verse number="47">Truly I say to you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.</verse>
  <verse number="48">But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord delays his coming;</verse>
  <verse number="49">And shall begin to smite his fellow servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken;</verse>
  <verse number="50">The lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looks not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of,</verse>
  <verse number="51">And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
