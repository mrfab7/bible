<chapter book="Job" number="7" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">“Is not man consigned to labor on earth? Are not his days like those of a hired hand?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Like a slave he longs for shade; like a hireling he waits for his wages.</verse>
  <verse number="3">So I am allotted months of futility, and nights of misery are appointed to me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">When I lie down I think: ‘When will I get up?’ But the night drags on, and I toss and turn until dawn.</verse>
  <verse number="5">My flesh is clothed with worms and encrusted with dirt; my skin is cracked and festering.</verse>
  <verse number="6">My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle; they come to an end without hope.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Remember that my life is but a breath. My eyes will never again see happiness.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The eye that beholds me will no longer see me. You will look for me, but I will be no more.</verse>
  <verse number="9">As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so he who goes down to Sheol does not come back up.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He never returns to his house; his place remembers him no more.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Am I the sea, or the monster of the deep, that You must keep me under guard?</verse>
  <verse number="13">When I think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint,</verse>
  <verse number="14">then You frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions,</verse>
  <verse number="15">so that I would prefer strangling and death over my life in this body.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I loathe my life! I would not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath.</verse>
  <verse number="17">What is man that You should exalt him, that You should set Your heart upon him,</verse>
  <verse number="18">that You attend to him every morning, and test him every moment?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Will You never look away from me, or leave me alone to swallow my spittle?</verse>
  <verse number="20">If I have sinned, what have I done to You, O watcher of mankind? Why have You made me Your target, so that I am a burden to You?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Why do You not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity? For soon I will lie down in the dust; You will seek me, but I will be no more.”</verse>
