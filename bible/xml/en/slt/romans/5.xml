  <verse number="1">Justified therefore of faith we have peace with God by our Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="2">By whom also we have had access by faith into this grace in which we have stood, and we boast upon hope of the glory of God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And not only, but also we boast in affliction: knowing that affliction works perseverance;</verse>
  <verse number="4">And perseverance, proof; and proof, hope.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And hope shames not; for the love of God has been poured in our hearts by the Holy Spirit given us.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For yet Christ, we being weak, Recording to the time died for the impious.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For scarcely for the just will any one die: yet for the good perhaps some also would venture to die.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And God recommends his own love to us, that we yet being sinful, Christ died for us.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Much more then, justified now in his blood, we shall be saved by him from wrath.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For if, being enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, reconciled, we shall be saved in his life.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And not only, but also boasting in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Therefore, as by one man sin came into the world, and by sin death; and so death passed upon all men, in that all have sinned:</verse>
  <verse number="13">(For until the law sin was in the world: and sin is not charged, being no law.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But death reigned from Adam to Moses, and upon them not having sinned upon the likeness of Adam’s transgression, who is the type of him about to be.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But not as the fall, so also the favor. For if for the fall of one many died, much more the grace of God, and the gift in grace, of one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to many.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And not as by one having sinned, the gift: for truly the judgment of one to condemnation, but the favor of many falls to justification.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For if by the fall of one, death reigned by one; much more they receiving the abundance of grace and the gift of justice in life shall reign by one, Jesus Christ.)</verse>
  <verse number="18">Therefore as by the fall of one for all men to condemnation; so also by the justification of one for all men to justification of life.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For as by one man’s disobedience many were constituted sinful, so also by the obedience of one shall many be constituted just.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the law entered, that the fall might abound. And where sin abounded, grace superabounded:</verse>
  <verse number="21">That as sin reigned in death, so grace might reign by justice to life eternal, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
