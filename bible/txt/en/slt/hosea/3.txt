1	And Jehovah will say to me, Yet go, love a woman loving evil and an adulteress, as Jehovah loves the sons of Israel, and they took to other gods and love raisin-cakes.
2	And I shall buy her to me for fifteen of silver, and an homer of barley, and a measure of barley:
3	And saying to her, Many days thou shalt well with me; and thou shalt not commit fornication, and thou shalt not be for a man: and also I am for thee.
4	For many days shall the sons of Israel dwell, not a king and not a chief and not a sacrifice and not a pillar and it one ephod and teraphim.
5	Afterward the sons of Israel shall turn back and they sought Jehovah their God, and David their king; and they trembled at Jehovah and at his goodness in the last of the days.
