1	My spirit being destroyed my days were extinct; the graves are for me.
2	If not mockings with me? and shall not mine eye lodge in their bitterness?
3	Set up now, pledge me with thee: who is he will strike for my hand?
4	For thou didst hide their heart from understanding; for this thou wilt not exalt them.
5	He will commence evils for a position, and the eyes of his sons shall be consumed.
6	He set me for a parable of the peoples, and I shall be one spit upon to the face.
7	And mine eye shall be weak from vexation, and my thoughts as a shadow all of them.
8	The upright shall be astonished upon this, and the innocent Shall arouse himself against the profane.
9	And the just shall hold on his way, and the clean one of hands shall add strength.
10	But ye all shall turn back, and come ye now, and I shall not find a wise one among you.
11	My days passed away, my purposes were broken; the possessions of my heart.
12	They will set the night for day: the light being near from the face of darkness.
13	If I shall wait, hades is my house: in darkness I spread my bed.
14	I called to the pit: Grave, thou my father: and to the worm, My mother, and my sister.
15	And where now my hope? and my hope who shall regard it?
16	They shall go down to the bars of hades if together we shall go down to the dust.
