<div class="chapter" data-book="2 Timothy" data-chapter="1" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">To Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience as did my forefathers, as I constantly remember you night and day in my prayers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Recalling your tears, I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first dwelt in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am convinced is in you as well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, love, and self-control.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">So do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, or of me, His prisoner. Instead, join me in suffering for the gospel by the power of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He has saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works, but by His own purpose and by the grace He granted us in Christ Jesus before time began.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And now He has revealed this grace through the appearing of our Savior, Christ Jesus, who has abolished death and illuminated the way to life and immortality through the gospel,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">to which I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For this reason, even though I suffer as I do, I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that He is able to guard what I have entrusted to Him for that day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hold on to the pattern of sound teaching you have heard from me, with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Guard the treasure entrusted to you, with the help of the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">You know that everyone in the Province of Asia has deserted me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, because he has often refreshed me and was unashamed of my chains.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Indeed, when he arrived in Rome, he searched diligently until he found me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">May the Lord grant Onesiphorus His mercy on that day. You know very well how much he ministered to me in Ephesus.</p>
