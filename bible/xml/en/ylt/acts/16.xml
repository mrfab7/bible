  <verse number="1">And he came to Derbe and Lystra, and lo, a certain disciple was there, by name Timotheus son of a certain woman, a believing Jewess, but of a father, a Greek,</verse>
  <verse number="2">who was well testified to by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium;</verse>
  <verse number="3">this one did Paul wish to go forth with him, and having taken him, he circumcised him, because of the Jews who are in those places, for they all knew his father—that he was a Greek.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And as they were going on through the cities, they were delivering to them the decrees to keep, that have been judged by the apostles and the elders who are in Jerusalem,</verse>
  <verse number="5">then, indeed, were the assemblies established in the faith, and were abounding in number every day;</verse>
  <verse number="6">and having gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia,</verse>
  <verse number="7">having gone toward Mysia, they were trying to go on toward Bithynia, and the Spirit did not suffer them,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and having passed by Mysia, they came down to Troas.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And a vision through the night appeared to Paul—a certain man of Macedonia was standing, calling upon him, and saying, ‘Having passed through to Macedonia, help us;’—</verse>
  <verse number="10">and when he saw the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go forth to Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord hath called us to preach good news to them,</verse>
  <verse number="11">having set sail, therefore, from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, on the morrow also to Neapolis,</verse>
  <verse number="12">thence also to Philippi, which is a principal city of the part of Macedonia—a colony. And we were in this city abiding certain days,</verse>
  <verse number="13">on the sabbath-day also we went forth outside of the city, by a river, where there used to be prayer, and having sat down, we were speaking to the women who came together,</verse>
  <verse number="14">and a certain woman, by name Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, worshipping God, was hearing, whose heart the Lord did open to attend to the things spoken by Paul;</verse>
  <verse number="15">and when she was baptized, and her household, she did call upon us, saying, ‘If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, having entered into my house, remain;’ and she constrained us.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And it came to pass in our going on to prayer, a certain maid, having a spirit of Python, did meet us, who brought much employment to her masters by soothsaying,</verse>
  <verse number="17">she having followed Paul and us, was crying, saying, ‘These men are servants of the Most High God, who declare to us a way of salvation;’</verse>
  <verse number="18">and this she was doing for many days, but Paul having been grieved, and having turned, said to the spirit, ‘I command thee, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come forth from her;’ and it came forth the same hour.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And her masters having seen that the hope of their employment was gone, having caught Paul and Silas, drew them to the market-place, unto the rulers,</verse>
  <verse number="20">and having brought them to the magistrates, they said, ‘These men do exceedingly trouble our city, being Jews;</verse>
  <verse number="21">and they proclaim customs that are not lawful for us to receive nor to do, being Romans.’</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates having torn their garments from them, were commanding to beat them with rods,</verse>
  <verse number="23">many blows also having laid upon them, they cast them to prison, having given charge to the jailor to keep them safely,</verse>
  <verse number="24">who such a charge having received, did put them to the inner prison, and their feet made fast in the stocks.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And at midnight Paul and Silas praying, were singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were hearing them,</verse>
  <verse number="26">and suddenly a great earthquake came, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken, opened also presently were all the doors, and of all—the bands were loosed;</verse>
  <verse number="27">and the jailor having come out of sleep, and having seen the doors of the prison open, having drawn a sword, was about to kill himself, supposing the prisoners to be fled,</verse>
  <verse number="28">and Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, ‘Thou mayest not do thyself any harm, for we are all here.’</verse>
  <verse number="29">And, having asked for a light, he sprang in, and trembling he fell down before Paul and Silas,</verse>
  <verse number="30">and having brought them forth, said, ‘Sirs, what must I do—that I may be saved?’</verse>
  <verse number="31">and they said, ‘Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved—thou and thy house;’</verse>
  <verse number="32">and they spake to him the word of the Lord, and to all those in his household;</verse>
  <verse number="33">and having taken them, in that hour of the night, he did bathe them from the blows, and was baptized, himself and all his presently,</verse>
  <verse number="34">having brought them also into his house, he set food before them, and was glad with all the household, he having believed in God.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And day having come, the magistrates sent the rod-bearers, saying, ‘Let those men go;’</verse>
  <verse number="36">and the jailor told these words unto Paul—‘The magistrates have sent, that ye may be let go; now, therefore, having gone forth go on in peace;’</verse>
  <verse number="37">and Paul said to them, ‘Having beaten us publicly uncondemned—men, Romans being—they did cast us to prison, and now privately do they cast us forth! why no! but having come themselves, let them bring us forth.’</verse>
  <verse number="38">And the rod-bearers told to the magistrates these sayings, and they were afraid, having heard that they are Romans,</verse>
  <verse number="39">and having come, they besought them, and having brought them forth, they were asking them to go forth from the city;</verse>
  <verse number="40">and they, having gone forth out of the prison, entered into the house of Lydia, and having seen the brethren, they comforted them, and went forth.</verse>
