<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And [David] made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared for it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and thirty:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And said unto them, Ye [are] the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, [both] ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto [the place that] I have prepared for it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For because ye [did it] not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren [to be] the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And with them their brethren of the second [degree], Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, [were appointed] to sound with cymbals of brass;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, [was] for song: he instructed about the song, because he [was] skilful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Berechiah and Elkanah [were] doorkeepers for the ark.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and Jehiah [were] doorkeepers for the ark.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And David [was] clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also [had] upon him an ephod of linen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And it came to pass, [as] the ark of the covenant of the LORD came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.</p>
