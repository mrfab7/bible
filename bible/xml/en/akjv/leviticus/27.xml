  <verse number="1">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by your estimation.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And your estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even your estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And if it be a female, then your estimation shall be thirty shekels.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And if it be from five years old even to twenty years old, then your estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And if it be from a month old even to five years old, then your estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female your estimation shall be three shekels of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then your estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But if he be poorer than your estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering to the LORD, all that any man gives of such to the LORD shall be holy.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice to the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as you value it, who are the priest, so shall it be.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof to your estimation.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it shall be his.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And if a man shall sanctify to the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then your estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="17">If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to your estimation it shall stand.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain, even to the year of the jubilee, and it shall be abated from your estimation.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it shall be assured to him.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest’s.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And if a man sanctify to the LORD a field which he has bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;</verse>
  <verse number="23">Then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your estimation, even to the year of the jubilee: and he shall give your estimation in that day, as a holy thing to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="24">In the year of the jubilee the field shall return to him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And all your estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD’s firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD’s.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to your estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your estimation.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he has, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="29">None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD’s: it is holy to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="33">He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.</verse>
  <verse number="34">These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.</verse>
