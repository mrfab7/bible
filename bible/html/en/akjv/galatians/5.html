<div class="chapter" data-book="Galatians" data-chapter="5" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Stand fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ has made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Behold, I Paul say to you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Christ is become of no effect to you, whoever of you are justified by the law; you are fallen from grace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">You did run well; who did hinder you that you should not obey the truth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">This persuasion comes not of him that calls you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A little leaven leavens the whole lump.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I have confidence in you through the Lord, that you will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And I, brothers, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offense of the cross ceased.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I would they were even cut off which trouble you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For, brothers, you have been called to liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But if you bite and devour one another, take heed that you be not consumed one of another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But if you be led of the Spirit, you are not under the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, jealousies, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Contentions, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And they that are Christâ€™s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</p>
