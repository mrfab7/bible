  <verse number="1">And Jehoshaphat king of Judah returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Jehu the son of Hanani, the seer, went out to meet him, and said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and love them that hate Jehovah? Therefore is wrath upon thee from Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Nevertheless there are good things found in thee; for thou hast put away the Asherahs out of the land, and hast directed thy heart to seek God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Jehoshaphat dwelt in Jerusalem; and he went out again among the people from Beer-sheba to mount Ephraim, and brought them back to Jehovah the God of their fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he set judges in the land throughout the fortified cities of Judah, city by city.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he said to the judges, Take heed what ye do; for ye judge not for man, but for Jehovah, who will be with you in the matter of judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And now, let the terror of Jehovah be upon you; be careful what ye do, for there is no iniquity with Jehovah, nor respect of persons, nor taking of presents.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set some of the Levites And priests, And of the chief fathers of Israel, for the judgment of Jehovah And for causes. And they returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he charged them saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of Jehovah faithfully and with a perfect heart.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And what cause soever comes to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes and ordinances, ye shall even warn them that they trespass not against Jehovah, and so wrath come upon you and upon your brethren: this do and ye shall not trespass.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of Jehovah, and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, prince of the house of Judah, in all the king’s matters; and ye have the Levites before you as officers. Be strong and do it, and Jehovah will be with the good.</verse>
