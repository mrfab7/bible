<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Whither is thy beloved gone, Thou fairest among women? Whither is thy beloved turned aside? And we will seek him with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, To feed in the gardens and to gather lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine: He feedeth [his flock] among the lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thou art fair, my love, as Tirzah, Comely as Jerusalem, Terrible as troops with banners:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Turn away thine eyes from me, For they overcome me. Thy hair is as a flock of goats On the slopes of Gilead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep Which go up from the washing; Which have all borne twins, And none is barren among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples Behind thy veil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, And virgins without number:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">My dove, mine undefiled, is but one; She is the only one of her mother, She is the choice one of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and they called her blessed; The queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who is she that looketh forth as the dawn, Fair as the moon, clear as the sun, Terrible as troops with banners?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I went down into the garden of nuts, To see the verdure of the valley, To see whether the vine budded, Whether the pomegranates blossomed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Before I was aware, My soul set me upon the chariots of my willing people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Return, return, O Shulamite; Return, return, that we may look upon thee.—What would ye look upon in the Shulamite?—As it were the dance of two camps.</p>
