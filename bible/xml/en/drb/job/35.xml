  <verse number="1">Moreover Eliu spoke these words :</verse>
  <verse number="2">Doth thy thought seem right to thee, that thou shouldst say : I am more just than God?</verse>
  <verse number="3">For thou saidst : That which is right doth not please thee : or what will it profit thee if I sin?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Therefore I will answer thy words, and thy friends with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Look up to heaven and see, and behold the sky, that it is higher than thee.</verse>
  <verse number="6">If thou sin, what shalt thou hurt him? and if thy iniquities be multiplied, what shalt thou do against him?</verse>
  <verse number="7">And if thou do justly, what shalt thou give him, or what shall he receive of thy hand?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thy wickedness may hurt a man that is like thee : and thy justice may help the son of man.</verse>
  <verse number="9">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they shall cry out : and shall wail for the violence of the arm of tyrants.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And he hath not said : Where is God, who made me, who hath given songs in the night?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and instructeth us more than the fowls of the air.</verse>
  <verse number="12">There shall they cry, and he will not hear, because of the pride of evil men.</verse>
  <verse number="13">God therefore will not hear in vain, and the Almighty will look into the causes of every one.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Yea when thou shalt say : He considereth not : be judged before him, and expect him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For he doth not now bring on his fury, neither doth he revenge wickedness exceedingly.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore Job openeth his mouth in vain, and multiplieth words without knowledge.</verse>
