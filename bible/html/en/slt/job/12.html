<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="12" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job will answer and say,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Verily that ye are the people, and shall wisdom die with you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Also to me a heart like you; I fall not more than you: and with whom not like these?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I shall be he laughing at his neighbor, calling to God, and he will answer him: the just blameless one being laughed at.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">To misfortune is contempt to the thoughts of him at ease, being prepared for the waverings of the foot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The tents to those oppressing will be secure, and confidence to those provoking God to anger: whom God will bring into his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But ask now the beasts and they shall teach thee; and the birds of the heavens, and they shall announce to thee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Or speak to the earth and it shall teach thee; and the fishes of the sea shall recount to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who knew not in all these that the hand of God did this?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Which in his hand the soul of all living, and the spirit of all the flesh of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Shall not the ear try words? and the palate shall taste food to it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">With old men is wisdom, and length of days, understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">With him wisdom and strength, to him counsel and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Behold, he will pull down and it shall not be built up: he will shut up against man and it shall not be opened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold, he will hold back upon the waters, and they will dry up: and he will send them forth and they will overturn the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">With him strength and purpose: to him the one led astray and him leading astray.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Leading away counselors stripped off and he will make foolish the judges.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He loosed the bonds of kings, and he will gird upon their loins a girdle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Leading away priests stripped off, and he will overthrow the mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Removing the lip to the faithful, and he will take discernment of old men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Proving contempt upon nobles, and he slackened the girdle of the strong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Revealing deep things from darkness, and he will bring to light the shadow of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Making great to the nations, and he will destroy them: he spread out to the nations, and he will guide them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Taking away the heart of the heads of the people of the earth, and he will cause them to wander in a waste, not a way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">They will feel darkness and not light, and he will cause them to wander as one intoxicated.</p>
