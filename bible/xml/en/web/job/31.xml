<chapter book="Job" number="31" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">“I made a covenant with my eyes, how then should I look lustfully at a young woman?</verse>
  <verse number="2">For what is the portion from God above, and the heritage from the Almighty on high?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, and disaster to the workers of iniquity?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Doesn’t he see my ways, and number all my steps?</verse>
  <verse number="5">“If I have walked with falsehood, and my foot has hurried to deceit</verse>
  <verse number="6">(let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know my integrity);</verse>
  <verse number="7">if my step has turned out of the way, if my heart walked after my eyes, if any defilement has stuck to my hands,</verse>
  <verse number="8">then let me sow, and let another eat. Yes, let the produce of my field be rooted out.</verse>
  <verse number="9">“If my heart has been enticed to a woman, and I have laid wait at my neighbor’s door,</verse>
  <verse number="10">then let my wife grind for another, and let others sleep with her.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For that would be a heinous crime. Yes, it would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges:</verse>
  <verse number="12">For it is a fire that consumes to destruction, and would root out all my increase.</verse>
  <verse number="13">“If I have despised the cause of my male servant or of my female servant, when they contended with me;</verse>
  <verse number="14">What then shall I do when God rises up? When he visits, what shall I answer him?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Didn’t he who made me in the womb make him? Didn’t one fashion us in the womb?</verse>
  <verse number="16">“If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,</verse>
  <verse number="17">or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless has not eaten of it</verse>
  <verse number="18">(no, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, her have I guided from my mother’s womb);</verse>
  <verse number="19">if I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or that the needy had no covering;</verse>
  <verse number="20">if his heart hasn’t blessed me, if he hasn’t been warmed with my sheep’s fleece;</verse>
  <verse number="21">if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate,</verse>
  <verse number="22">then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade, and my arm be broken from the bone.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For calamity from God is a terror to me. Because his majesty, I can do nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="24">“If I have made gold my hope, and have said to the fine gold, ‘You are my confidence;’</verse>
  <verse number="25">If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gotten much;</verse>
  <verse number="26">if I have seen the sun when it shined, or the moon moving in splendor,</verse>
  <verse number="27">and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth,</verse>
  <verse number="28">this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges; for I should have denied the God who is above.</verse>
  <verse number="29">“If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him who hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him;</verse>
  <verse number="30">(yes, I have not allowed my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse);</verse>
  <verse number="31">if the men of my tent have not said, ‘Who can find one who has not been filled with his meat?’</verse>
  <verse number="32">(the foreigner has not lodged in the street, but I have opened my doors to the traveler);</verse>
  <verse number="33">if like Adam I have covered my transgressions, by hiding my iniquity in my heart,</verse>
  <verse number="34">because I feared the great multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and didn’t go out of the door—</verse>
  <verse number="35">oh that I had one to hear me! (behold, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me); let the accuser write my indictment!</verse>
  <verse number="36">Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; and I would bind it to me as a crown.</verse>
  <verse number="37">I would declare to him the number of my steps. as a prince would I go near to him.</verse>
  <verse number="38">If my land cries out against me, and its furrows weep together;</verse>
  <verse number="39">if I have eaten its fruits without money, or have caused its owners to lose their life,</verse>
  <verse number="40">let briars grow instead of wheat, and stinkweed instead of barley.” The words of Job are ended.</verse>
