  <verse number="1">These spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour has come; honour thy Son, that thy Son honour thee:</verse>
  <verse number="2">As thou gavest him the power of all flesh, that every one which thou hast given him, he should give to them eternal life.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And this is eternal life, that they might know thee the only true God, and whom thou hast sent, Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I honoured thee upon earth: I finished the work which thou hast given me that I should do.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And now, honour thou me, O Father, with thyself, with the honour which I had with thee before the world was.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I manifested thy name to the men which thou hast given me from the world: they were to thee, and thou hast given them to me; and they have kept thy word.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For the words which thou hast given me, I have given them and they received, and knew in truth that I came out from thee, and they believed that thou sentest me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I ask for them: I ask not for the world, but for them thou hast given me: for they are to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And all my things are thine, and thine mine; and I have been honoured in them.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. O holy Father, keep them in thy name whom thou but given me, that they might be one, as we.</verse>
  <verse number="12">When I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those thou hast given me I watched, and not one of them perished, except the son of perdition; that the writing might be completed.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that I might have my joy completed in them.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I have given them thy word; and the world hated them, for they are not of the world, as I am not of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I ask not that thou take them out of the world, but that thou keep them from the evil.</verse>
  <verse number="16">They are not of the world, as I am not of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Render them holy in thy truth: thy word is truth.</verse>
  <verse number="18">As thou sentest me into the world, I also sent them into the world.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And for them I render myself holy, that they also be rendered holy in the truth;</verse>
  <verse number="20">And I ask not for these alone, but also for them believing in me through their word;</verse>
  <verse number="21">That all might be one; as thou, Father, in me, and I in thee, that they also be one in us; that the world might believe that thou sentest me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And I, the honour which thou hast given me, have given them; that they might be one, as we are one.</verse>
  <verse number="23">I in them, and thou in me, that they might be perfected in one: and that the world might know that thou sentest me, and lovedst them, as thou lovedst me.</verse>
  <verse number="24">O Father, those thou hast given me, I will that where I am these also be with me: that they might behold my glory, which thou gavest me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="25">O just Father, the world knew thee not: but I knew thee, and these knew that thou didst send me.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And I made known to them thy name, and I will make known: that the love with which thou lovedst me might be in them, and I in them.</verse>
