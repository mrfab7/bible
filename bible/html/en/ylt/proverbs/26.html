<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="26" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, So honour is not comely for a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As a bird by wandering, as a swallow by flying, So reviling without cause doth not come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A whip is for a horse, a bridle for an ass, And a rod for the back of fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Answer not a fool according to his folly, Lest thou be like to him—even thou.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Answer a fool according to his folly, Lest he be wise in his own eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He is cutting off feet, he is drinking injury, Who is sending things by the hand of a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Weak have been the two legs of the lame, And a parable in the mouth of fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">As one who is binding a stone in a sling, So is he who is giving honour to a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A thorn hath gone up into the hand of a drunkard, And a parable in the mouth of fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Great is the Former of all, And He is rewarding a fool, And is rewarding transgressors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">As a dog hath returned to its vomit, A fool is repeating his folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Thou hast seen a man wise in his own eyes, More hope of a fool than of him!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The slothful hath said, ‘A lion is in the way, A lion is in the broad places.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The door turneth round on its hinge, And the slothful on his bed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The slothful hath hid his hand in a dish, He is weary of bringing it back to his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Wiser is the slothful in his own eyes, Than seven men returning a reason.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Laying hold on the ears of a dog, Is a passer-by making himself wrath for strife not his own.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">As one pretending to be feeble, Who is casting sparks, arrows, and death,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">So hath a man deceived his neighbour, And hath said, ‘Am not I playing?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Without wood is fire going out, And without a tale-bearer, contention ceaseth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Coal to burning coals, and wood to fire, And a man of contentions to kindle strife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The words of a tale-bearer are as self-inflicted wounds, And they have gone down to the inner parts of the heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Silver of dross spread over potsherd, Are burning lips and an evil heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">By his lips doth a hater dissemble, And in his heart he placeth deceit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">When his voice is gracious trust not in him, For seven abominations are in his heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Hatred is covered by deceit, Revealed is its wickedness in an assembly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Whoso is digging a pit falleth into it, And the roller of a stone, to him it turneth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A lying tongue hateth its bruised ones, And a flattering mouth worketh an overthrow!</p>
