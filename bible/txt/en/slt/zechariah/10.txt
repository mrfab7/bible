1	Ask ye from Jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain; Jehovah made lightnings, and he will give rain of heavy showers to them, to each the green herb in the field.
2	For the family gods spake vanity, and the diviners saw falsehood, and they will speak dreams of falsehood they will comfort in vain: for this, they removed as a flock, they were afflicted for there was no shepherd.
3	Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I will review upon the he goats: for Jehovah of armies reviewed upon his flock the house of Judah, as the house of his strength in the war.
4	From him the chief, from him the nail, from him the bow of war, from him came forth every tyrant together.
5	And they were as the strong treading down in the mud of the streets in the battle: and they waged war, for Jehovah was with them, and they riding horses were ashamed.
6	And I strengthened the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I turned them back for I compassionated them, and they were as if I cast them not off: for I am Jehovah their God, and I will answer them.
7	And they were as the strong one of Ephraim, and their heart rejoiced as from wine: and their sons shall see, and rejoice; their heart shall exult in Jehovah.
8	I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I redeemed them: and they multiplied as they multiplied.
9	And I will sow them among the peoples, and in distant places shall they remember me: and they lived with their sons, and turned back.
10	And I turned them back from the hind of Egypt, and from Assur will I gather them, and to the land of Gilead and Lebanon will I bring them; and it shall not be found for them.
11	And he passed through the sea of straits, and he struck the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the river dried up; and the pride of Assur was brought down, and the rod of Egypt shall depart.
12	And I strengthened them in Jehovah; and in his name shall they go about, says Jehovah.
