<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the LORD said to Aaron, You and your sons and your father’s house with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And your brothers also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father, bring you with you, that they may be joined to you, and minister to you: but you and your sons with you shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they shall keep your charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come near the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor you also, die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they shall be joined to you, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come near to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And you shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more on the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And I, behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Therefore you and your sons with you shall keep your priest’s office for everything of the altar, and within the veil; and you shall serve: I have given your priest’s office to you as a service of gift: and the stranger that comes near shall be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Behold, I also have given you the charge of my heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; to you have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to your sons, by an ordinance for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">This shall be your of the most holy things, reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs which they shall render to me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">In the most holy place shall you eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And this is yours; the heave offering of their gift, with all the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in your house shall eat of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the first fruits of them which they shall offer to the LORD, them have I given you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And whatever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring to the LORD, shall be yours; every one that is clean in your house shall eat of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Every thing devoted in Israel shall be yours.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Every thing that opens the matrix in all flesh, which they bring to the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be yours: nevertheless the firstborn of man shall you surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shall you redeem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shall you redeem, according to your estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy: you shall sprinkle their blood on the altar, and shall burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet smell to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the flesh of them shall be yours, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder are yours.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to the LORD, have I given you, and your sons and your daughters with you, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD to you and to your seed with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the LORD spoke to Aaron, You shall have no inheritance in their land, neither shall you have any part among them: I am your part and your inheritance among the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Neither must the children of Israel from now on come near the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an heave offering to the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said to them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Thus speak to the Levites, and say to them, When you take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then you shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And this your heave offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it were the corn of the threshing floor, and as the fullness of the wine press.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Thus you also shall offer an heave offering to the LORD of all your tithes, which you receive of the children of Israel; and you shall give thereof the LORD’s heave offering to Aaron the priest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Out of all your gifts you shall offer every heave offering of the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Therefore you shall say to them, When you have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted to the Levites as the increase of the threshing floor, and as the increase of the wine press.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And you shall eat it in every place, you and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And you shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall you pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest you die.</p>
