<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="34" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Elihu answereth and saith:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear, O wise men, my words, And, O knowing ones, give ear to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the ear doth try words, And the palate tasteth to eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Judgment let us choose for ourselves, Let us know among ourselves what is good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For Job hath said, ‘I have been righteous, And God hath turned aside my right,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Against my right do I lie? Mortal is mine arrow—without transgression.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Who is a man like Job? He drinketh scoffing like water,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he hath travelled for company With workers of iniquity, So as to go with men of wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For he hath said, ‘It doth not profit a man, When he delighteth himself with God.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore, O men of heart, hearken to me; Far be it from God to do wickedness, And from the Mighty to do perverseness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the work of man he repayeth to him, And according to the path of each He doth cause him to find.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Yea, truly, God doth not do wickedly, And the Mighty doth not pervert judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who hath inspected for Himself the earth? And who hath placed all the habitable world?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If He doth set on him His heart, His spirit and his breath unto Him He gathereth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Expire doth all flesh together, And man to dust returneth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And if there is understanding, hear this, Give ear to the voice of my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Yea, doth one hating justice govern? Or the Most Just dost thou condemn?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Who hath said to a king—‘Worthless,’ Unto princes—‘Wicked?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">That hath not accepted the person of princes, Nor hath known the rich before the poor, For a work of His hands are all of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In a moment they die, and at midnight Shake do people, and they pass away, And they remove the mighty without hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For His eyes are on the ways of each, And all his steps He doth see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">There is no darkness nor death-shade, For workers of iniquity to be hidden there;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For He doth not suffer man any more, To go unto God in judgment,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He breaketh the mighty—no searching! And He appointeth others in their stead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Therefore He knoweth their works, And He hath overturned by night, And they are bruised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">As wicked He hath stricken them, In the place of beholders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Because that against right They have turned aside from after Him, And none of His ways have considered wisely,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">To cause to come in unto Him The cry of the poor, And the cry of the afflicted He heareth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And He giveth rest, and who maketh wrong? And hideth the face, and who beholdeth it? And in reference to a nation and to a man, It is the same.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">From the reigning of a profane man, From the snares of a people;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For unto God hath any said: ‘I have taken away, I do not corruptly,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Besides that which I see, shew Thou me, If iniquity I have done—I do not add?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">By thee doth He recompense, That thou hast refused—That thou dost choose, and not I? And what thou hast known, speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Let men of heart say to me, And a wise man is hearkening to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Job—not with knowledge doth he speak, And his words are not with wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">My Father! let Job be tried—unto victory, Because of answers for men of iniquity,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">For he doth add to his sin, Transgression among us he vomiteth, And multiplieth his sayings to God.</p>
