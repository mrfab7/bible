<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Canst thou number the months that they fulfill? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, they cast out their sorrows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up in the open field; they go forth, and return not again,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the salt land his dwelling place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He scorneth the tumult of the city, neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Will the wild-ox be content to serve thee? or will he abide by thy crib?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave to him thy labour?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Wilt thou confide in him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather the corn of thy threshingfloor?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The wing of the ostrich rejoiceth, but are her pinions and feathers kindly?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For she leaveth her eggs on the earth, and warmeth them in the dust,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may trample them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">She is hardened against her young ones, as if they were not hers: though her labour be in vain, she is without fear;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Hast thou given the horse his might? hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Hast thou made him to leap as a locust? the glory of his snorting is terrible.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth out to meet the armed men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He mocketh at fear, and is not dismayed; neither turneth he back from the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The quiver rattleth against him, the flashing spear and the javelin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage; neither believeth he that it is the voice of the trumpet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">As oft as the trumpet soundeth he saith, Aha! and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Doth the hawk soar by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">She dwelleth on the rock, and hath her lodging there, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong hold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">From thence she spieth out the prey; her eyes behold it afar off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.</p>
