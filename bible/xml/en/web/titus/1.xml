  <verse number="1">Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,</verse>
  <verse number="2">in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t lie, promised before time began;</verse>
  <verse number="3">but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior;</verse>
  <verse number="4">to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you;</verse>
  <verse number="6">if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;</verse>
  <verse number="8">but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled;</verse>
  <verse number="9">holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,</verse>
  <verse number="11">whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain’s sake.</verse>
  <verse number="12">One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</verse>
  <verse number="14">not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.</verse>
  <verse number="16">They profess that they know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.</verse>
