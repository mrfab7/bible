<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim and Leummim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But to the sons of the concubines which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son (while he yet lived) eastward, to the east country.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, a hundred and seventy five years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then Abraham expired, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac: and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bore to Abraham.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: The first-born of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And these are the years of the life of Ishmael; a hundred and thirty and seven years: and he expired and died, and was gathered to his people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest towards Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begat Isaac:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Isaac entreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the children struggled together within her: and she said, If it is so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And the LORD said to her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels: and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And the first was born red, all over like a hairy garment: and they called his name Esau.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And after that his brother was born, and his hand took hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was sixty years old when she bore them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And the boys grew: and Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Jacob boiled pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And Jacob said, Sell to me this day thy birth-right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birth-right bring to me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore to him: and he sold his birth-right to Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he ate and drank, and rose and went his way: thus Esau despised his birth-right.</p>
