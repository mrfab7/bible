  <verse number="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">If we assay to commune with you, will you be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Your words have upheld him that was falling, and you have strengthened the feeble knees.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But now it is come on you, and you faint; it touches you, and you are troubled.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Is not this your fear, your confidence, your hope, and the uprightness of your ways?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Remember, I pray you, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</verse>
  <verse number="9">By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a little thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="13">In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,</verse>
  <verse number="14">Fear came on me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</verse>
  <verse number="16">It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before my eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="17">Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</verse>
  <verse number="19">How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?</verse>
  <verse number="20">They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Does not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.</verse>
