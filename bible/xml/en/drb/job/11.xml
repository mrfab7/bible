  <verse number="1">Then Sophar the Naamathite answered, and said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Shall not he that speaketh much, hear also? or shall a man full of talk be justified?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Shall men hold their peace to thee only? and when thou hast mocked others, shall no man confute thee?</verse>
  <verse number="4">For thou hast said: My word is pure, and I am clean in thy sight.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And I wish that God would speak with thee, and would open his lips to thee,</verse>
  <verse number="6">That he might shew thee the secrets of wisdom, and that his law is manifold, and thou mightest understand that he exacteth much less of thee, than thy iniquity deserveth.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Peradventure thou wilt comprehend the steps of God, and wilt find out the Almighty perfectly?</verse>
  <verse number="8">He is higher than heaven, and what wilt thou do ? he is deeper than hell, and how wilt thou know?</verse>
  <verse number="9">The measure of him is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If he shall overturn all things, or shall press them together, who shall contradict him?</verse>
  <verse number="11">For he knoweth the vanity of men, and when he seeth iniquity, doth he not consider it?</verse>
  <verse number="12">A vain man is lifted up into pride, and thinketh himself born free like a wild ass’s colt.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Rut thou hast hardened thy heart, and hast spread thy hands to him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">If thou wilt put away from thee the iniquity that is in thy hand, and lot not injustice remain in thy tabernacle:</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then mayst thou lift up thy face without spot, and thou shalt be steadfast, and shalt not fear.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Thou shalt also forget misery, and remember it only as waters that are passed away.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And brightness like that of the noonday, shall arise to thee at evening: and when thou shalt think thyself consumed, thou shalt rise as the day star.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And thou shalt have confidence, hope being set before thee, and being buried thou shalt sleep secure.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Thou shalt rest, and there shall be none to make thee afraid: and many shall entreat thy face.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But the eyes of the wicked shall decay, and the way to escape shall fail them, and their hope the abomination of the soul.</verse>
