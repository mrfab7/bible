<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it shall be on the day when you shall pass over Jordan to the land which the LORD your God gives you, that you shall set you up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And you shall write on them all the words of this law, when you are passed over, that you may go in to the land which the LORD your God gives you, a land that flows with milk and honey; as the LORD God of your fathers has promised you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Therefore it shall be when you be gone over Jordan, that you shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And there shall you build an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones: you shall not lift up any iron tool on them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">You shall build the altar of the LORD your God of whole stones: and you shall offer burnt offerings thereon to the LORD your God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And you shall offer peace offerings, and shall eat there, and rejoice before the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And you shall write on the stones all the words of this law very plainly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel, saying, Take heed, and listen, O Israel; this day you are become the people of the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">You shall therefore obey the voice of the LORD your God, and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command you this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">These shall stand on mount Gerizim to bless the people, when you are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And these shall stand on mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad, and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And the Levites shall speak, and say to all the men of Israel with a loud voice,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Cursed be the man that makes any graven or molten image, an abomination to the LORD, the work of the hands of the craftsman, and puts it in a secret place. And all the people shall answer and say, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Cursed be he that sets light by his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Cursed be he that removes his neighbor’s landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Cursed be he that makes the blind to wander out of the way. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Cursed be he that perverts the judgment of the stranger, fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Cursed be he that lies with his father’s wife; because he uncovers his father’s skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Cursed be he that lies with any manner of beast. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Cursed be he that lies with his sister, the daughter of his father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Cursed be he that lies with his mother in law. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Cursed be he that smites his neighbor secretly. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Cursed be he that takes reward to slay an innocent person. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Cursed be he that confirms not all the words of this law to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.</p>
