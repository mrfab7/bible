<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The words of Agur the son of Jakeh; the prophecy uttered by the man unto Ithiel, [even] unto Ithiel and Ucal:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Truly I am more stupid than any one; and I have not a man’s intelligence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I have neither learned wisdom, nor have I the knowledge of the Holy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who hath ascended up into the heavens, and descended? Who hath gathered the wind in his fists? Who hath bound the waters in a mantle? Who hath established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son’s name, if thou knowest?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Every word of +God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Two things do I ask of thee; deny me [them] not before I die:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the bread of my daily need:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">lest I be full and deny [thee], and say, Who is Jehovah? or lest I be poor and steal, and outrage the name of my God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Speak not too much about a servant to his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be held guilty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">there is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, yet are not washed from their filthiness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">there is a generation,—how lofty are their eyes, how their eyelids are lifted up!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">—a generation whose teeth are swords, and their jaw-teeth knives, to devour the afflicted from off the earth, and the needy from [among] men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The leech hath two daughters: Give, give. There are three [things] never satisfied; four which say not, It is enough:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">—Sheol, and the barren womb; the earth which is not filled with water, and the fire which saith not, It is enough.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The eye that mocketh at a father, and despiseth to obey a mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">There are three [things] too wonderful for me, and four that I know not:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The way of an eagle in the heavens, the way of a serpent upon a rock, the way of a ship in the midst of the sea, and the way of a man with a maid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Such is the way of an adulterous woman: she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Under three [things] the earth is disquieted, and under four it cannot bear up:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Under a servant when he reigneth, and a churl when he is filled with meat;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">under an odious [woman] when she is married, and a handmaid when she is heir to her mistress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">There are four [things] little upon the earth, and they are exceeding wise:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The ants, a people not strong, yet they provide their food in the summer;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">the rock-badgers are but a feeble folk, yet they make their house in the cliff;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">the locusts have no king, yet they go forth all of them by bands;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">thou takest hold of the lizard with the hands, yet is she in kings’ palaces.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">There are three [things] which have a stately step, and four are comely in going:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The lion, mighty among beasts, which turneth not away for any;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">a [horse] girt in the loins; or the he-goat; and a king, against whom none can rise up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, [lay] the hand upon thy mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">For the pressing of milk bringeth forth butter, and the pressing of the nose bringeth forth blood; and the pressing of anger bringeth forth strife.</p>
