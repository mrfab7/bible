<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it goes out from Bethel to Luz. And it crosses the border of Archi to Ataroth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And it descends to the west, beside the border of Japhleti, as far as the borders of lower Beth-horon, and to Gezer. And the last parts of its regions are by the great sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Manasseh and Ephraim, the sons of Joseph, possessed it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the border of the sons of Ephraim was made by their families. And their possession toward the east was from Ataroth-addar, as far as upper Beth-horon,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and the confines extend to the sea. Yet truly, Michmethath looks toward the north, and it circles around the borders, toward the east, into Taanath-shiloh. And it continues on, from the east, to Janoah.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And there were cities, with their villages, which were set aside for the sons of Ephraim, in the midst of the possession of the sons of Manasseh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the sons of Ephraim did not put to death the Canaanite that was living at Gezer. And the Canaanite lived in the midst of Ephraim, even to this day, paying tribute.</p>
