<chapter book="1 Peter" number="3" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">In like manner, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be gained by the behavior of their wives;</verse>
  <verse number="2">beholding your chaste behavior coupled with fear.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Whose adorning let it not be the outward adorning of braiding the hair, and of wearing jewels of gold, or of putting on apparel;</verse>
  <verse number="4">but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For after this manner aforetime the holy women also, who hoped in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:</verse>
  <verse number="6">as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose children ye now are, if ye do well, and are not put in fear by any terror.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Ye husbands, in like manner, dwell with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Finally, be ye all likeminded, compassionate, loving as brethren, tenderhearted, humbleminded:</verse>
  <verse number="9">not rendering evil for evil, or reviling for reviling; but contrariwise blessing; for hereunto were ye called, that ye should inherit a blessing.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For, He that would love life, And see good days, Let him refrain his tongue from evil, And his lips that they speak no guile:</verse>
  <verse number="11">And let him turn away from evil, and do good; Let him seek peace, and pursue it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, And his ears unto their supplication: But the face of the Lord is upon them that do evil.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And who is he that will harm you, if ye be zealous of that which is good?</verse>
  <verse number="14">But even if ye should suffer for righteousness’ sake, blessed are ye: and fear not their fear, neither be troubled;</verse>
  <verse number="15">but sanctify in your hearts Christ as Lord: being ready always to give answer to every man that asketh you a reason concerning the hope that is in you, yet with meekness and fear:</verse>
  <verse number="16">having a good conscience; that, wherein ye are spoken against, they may be put to shame who revile your good manner of life in Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For it is better, if the will of God should so will, that ye suffer for well-doing than for evil-doing.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Because Christ also suffered for sins once, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God; being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="19">in which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison,</verse>
  <verse number="20">that aforetime were disobedient, when the longsuffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:</verse>
  <verse number="21">which also after a true likeness doth now save you, even baptism, not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the interrogation of a good conscience toward God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="22">who is on the right hand of God, having gone into heaven; angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.</verse>
