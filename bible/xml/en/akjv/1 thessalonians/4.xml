<chapter book="1 Thessalonians" number="4" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For you know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication:</verse>
  <verse number="4">That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor;</verse>
  <verse number="5">Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:</verse>
  <verse number="6">That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For God has not called us to uncleanness, but to holiness.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He therefore that despises, despises not man, but God, who has also given to us his holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But as touching brotherly love you need not that I write to you: for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And indeed you do it toward all the brothers which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brothers, that you increase more and more;</verse>
  <verse number="11">And that you study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;</verse>
  <verse number="12">That you may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that you may have lack of nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But I would not have you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:</verse>
  <verse number="17">Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Why comfort one another with these words.</verse>
