<chapter book="Philippians" number="4" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Therefore, my dearly beloved brethren, and most desired, my joy and my crown; so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I beg of Evodia, and I beseech Syntyche, to be of one mind in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I entreat thee also, my sincere companion, help those women who have laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement and the rest of my fellow labourers, whose names are in the book of life.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Rejoice in the Lord always; again, I say, rejoice.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Let your modesty be known to all men. The Lord is nigh.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Be nothing solicitous; but in every thing, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever modest, whatsoever just, whatsoever holy, whatsoever lovely, whatsoever of good fame, if there be any virtue, if any praise of discipline, think on these things.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The things which you have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these do ye, and the God of peace shall be with you.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Now I rejoice in the Lord exceedingly, that now at length your thought for me hath flourished again, as you did also think; but you were busied.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I speak not as it were for want. For I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, to be content therewith.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I know both how to be brought low, and I know how to abound: (everywhere, and in all things I am instructed) both to be full, and to be hungry; both to abound, and to suffer need.</verse>
  <verse number="13">I can do all these things in him who strengtheneth me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Nevertheless you have done well in communicating to my tribulation.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And you also know, O Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only:</verse>
  <verse number="16">For unto Thessalonica also you sent once and again for my use.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that may abound to your account.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But I have all, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things you sent, an odour of sweetness, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And may my God supply all your want, according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Now to God and our Father be glory world without end. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Salute ye every saint in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The brethren who are with me, salute you. All the saints salute you; especially they that are of Caesar’s household.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
