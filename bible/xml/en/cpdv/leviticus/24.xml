  <verse number="1">And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Instruct the sons of Israel, so that they may bring to you clear oil from the purest olives, in order to supply the lamps continuously</verse>
  <verse number="3">outside the veil of the testimony in the tabernacle of the covenant. And Aaron shall place these, from evening until morning, before the Lord, as a perpetual worship and ritual in your generations.</verse>
  <verse number="4">They shall be placed upon the most pure candlestick in the sight of the Lord always.</verse>
  <verse number="5">You shall also receive fine wheat flour, and you shall bake twelve loaves from it, each loaf of which shall have two-tenths.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And you shall arrange them, six on each side, upon the most pure table before the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And you shall place upon them the clearest frankincense, so that the bread may be a memorial of oblation for the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="8">On each Sabbath, they shall be changed before the Lord, having been received from the sons of Israel as an everlasting covenant.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they shall be for Aaron and his sons, so that they may eat these in the holy place; for it is the Holy of holies from the sacrifices of the Lord, as a perpetual right.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then, behold, the son of an Israelite woman, whom she had born of an Egyptian man among the sons of Israel, going out, was quarreling in the camp with a man of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And when he had blasphemed the name, and had cursed it, he was led to Moses. (Now his mother was called Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri from the tribe of Dan.)</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they sent him to prison, until they might know what the Lord would command,</verse>
  <verse number="13">who spoke to Moses,</verse>
  <verse number="14">saying: Lead away the blasphemer beyond the camp, and let all who heard him place their hands upon his head, and let the entire people stone him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And you shall say to the sons of Israel: The man who curses his God shall bear his sin,</verse>
  <verse number="16">and whoever will have blasphemed the name of the Lord shall be put to death. The entire multitude shall overwhelm him with stones, whether he be a citizen or a sojourner. Whoever blasphemes the name of the Lord shall be put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Whoever will have struck and killed a man shall be put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Whoever will have struck down an animal shall repay its equivalent, that is, a life for a life.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Whoever will have inflicted a blemish on any of his citizens, just as he has done, so shall it be done to him:</verse>
  <verse number="20">fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, shall he repay. Whatever degree of blemish he has inflicted, so shall he be compelled to suffer.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Whoever strikes down a beast, shall repay another. Whoever strikes a man shall be punished.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Let there be equal judgment among you, whether it is a sojourner or a citizen who will have sinned. For I am the Lord your God.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel. And they led away him who had blasphemed, beyond the camp, and they overwhelmed him with stones. And the sons of Israel did just as the Lord had instructed Moses.</verse>
