<div class="chapter" data-book="2 Timothy" data-chapter="4" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I charge thee in the sight of God, and of Christ Jesus, who shall judge the quick and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine; but, having itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside unto fables.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But be thou sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill thy ministry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day: and not only to me, but also to all them that have loved his appearing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">for Demas forsook me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is useful to me for ministering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the parchments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will render to him according to his works:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">of whom be thou ware also; for he greatly withstood our words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The Lord be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.</p>
