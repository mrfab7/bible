<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I charge [thee] therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they shall turn away [their] ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I have fought a good fight, I have finished [my] course, I have kept the faith:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring [with thee], and the books, [but] especially the parchments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">At my first answer no man stood with me, but all [men] forsook me: [I pray God] that it may not be laid to their charge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and [that] all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve [me] unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The Lord Jesus Christ [be] with thy spirit. Grace [be] with you. Amen.</p>
