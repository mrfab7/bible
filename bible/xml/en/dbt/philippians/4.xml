  <verse number="1">So that, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, thus stand fast in [the] Lord, beloved.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I exhort Euodia, and exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in [the] Lord;</verse>
  <verse number="3">yea, I ask thee also, true yokefellow, assist them, who have contended along with me in the glad tidings, with Clement also, and my other fellow-labourers, whose names [are] in [the] book of life.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Rejoice in [the] Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Let your gentleness be known of all men. The Lord [is] near.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Be careful about nothing; but in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;</verse>
  <verse number="7">and the peace of God, which surpasses every understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts by Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things [are] true, whatsoever things [are] noble, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] amiable, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue and if any praise, think on these things.</verse>
  <verse number="9">What ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, these things do; and the God of peace shall be with you.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But I rejoiced in [the] Lord greatly, that now however at length ye have revived your thinking of me, though surely ye did also think [of me], but lacked opportunity.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Not that I speak as regards privation, for as to me I have learnt in those circumstances in which I am, to be satisfied in myself.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound. In everything and in all things I am initiated both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer privation.</verse>
  <verse number="13">I have strength for all things in him that gives me power.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But ye have done well in taking part in my affliction.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And know also ye, O Philippians, that in [the] beginning of the gospel, when I came out of Macedonia, no assembly communicated [anything] to me in [the] way of giving and receiving save ye alone;</verse>
  <verse number="16">for also in Thessalonica once and even twice ye sent to me for my need.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Not that I seek gift, but I seek fruit abounding to your account.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But I have all things in full supply and abound; I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things [sent] from you, an odour of sweet savour, an acceptable sacrifice, agreeable to God.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But my God shall abundantly supply all your need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But to our God and Father [be] glory to the ages of ages. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who [are] with me salute you.</verse>
  <verse number="22">All the saints salute you, and specially those of the household of Caesar.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
