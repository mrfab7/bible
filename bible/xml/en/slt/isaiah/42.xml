<chapter book="Isaiah" number="42" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Behold my servant, I will hold fast in him; my chosen, my soul delighted; I gave my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the nations.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He shall not cry, and be shall not lift up, and he shall not cause his voice to be heard without.</verse>
  <verse number="3">A broken reed he shall not break, and bedimmed flax shall he not quench it: he shall bring forth judgment to truth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He shall not be weak, and he shall not break, till he shall set judgment in the earth; and the isles shall wait for his law:</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thus said God Jehovah, creating the heavens and stretching them out; and spreading out the earth and its productions; giving breath to the people upon it, and spirit to those going upon it:</verse>
  <verse number="6">I Jehovah called thee in justice, and I will hold by thy hand, and I will guard thee and give thee for a covenant of the people, for the light of the nations,</verse>
  <verse number="7">To open the eyes of the blind, to bring forth the bound out of prison, those sitting in darkness out of the house of the prison.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I Jehovah, this my name: and my glory I will not give to another, and my praise to carved images.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The first things, behold, they came, and new things I announce: before they shall spring up I will cause you to hear.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Sing ye to Jehovah a new song, and his praise from the extremity of the earth, ye going down to the sea, and its fulness; the isles and their inhabitants.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The desert and its cities shall lift up, the enclosures shall Kedar inhabit: they inhabiting the rock shall shout for joy, from the head of the mountains they shall shout for joy.</verse>
  <verse number="12">They shall set glory to Jehovah, and they shall announce his praise in the islands.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Jehovah as a strong one shall go forth; as a man of war he shall raise up jealousy: he shall shout, also he shall cry aloud; he shall be strong against his enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I was silent of old; I will be still, I will restrain myself: as she bringing forth I will cry out; I will lay waste and snuff up together.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I will lay waste mountains and hills, and I will dry up all their green herbage; and I set the rivers for islands, and I will dry up the pools.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I brought the blind by a way they knew not; and I will cause them to tread in beaten paths they knew not: I will set darkness for light before them, and crooked ways into straightness; these words I did them, and I forsook them not.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They were turned back, they will be ashamed with shame, trusting in the carved image, saying to the molten image, Thou our God.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, to see.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Who blind but my servant? and deaf as my messenger I shall send? who blind he being perfect? and blind as the servant of Jehovah?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Seeing many things, and thou wilt not watch; opening the ears, and he will not bear.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Jehovah was pleased for sake of his justice; he will magnify the law and make glorious.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And this people was plundered and spoiled; snaring all of them in holes, and they were hid in houses of prisons: they were for plunder and none delivering; a treading down, and none said, Turn back.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Who among you will give ear to this? and will attend and hear hereafter?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Who gave Jacob for a treading down, and Israel for spoils? did not Jehovah against whom we sinned? and they would not go in his ways and they heard not to his laws.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And be will pour upon him the heat of his anger, and the strength of war: and it will burn him from round about, and he will not know; and it will feed upon him and he will not lay to the heart.</verse>
