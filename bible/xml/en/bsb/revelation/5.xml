<chapter book="Revelation" number="5" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Then I saw a scroll in the right hand of the One seated on the throne. It had writing on both sides and was sealed with seven seals.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?”</verse>
  <verse number="3">But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or look inside it.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And I began to weep bitterly, because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look inside it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed to open the scroll and its seven seals.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then I saw a Lamb who appeared to have been slain, standing in the center of the throne, encircled by the four living creatures and the elders. The Lamb had seven horns and seven eyes, which represent the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And He came and took the scroll from the right hand of the One seated on the throne.</verse>
  <verse number="8">When He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp, and they were holding golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they sang a new song: “Worthy are You to take the scroll and open its seals, because You were slain, and by Your blood You purchased for God those from every tribe and tongue and people and nation.</verse>
  <verse number="10">You have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign upon the earth.”</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then I looked, and I heard the voices of many angels encircling the throne, and the living creatures and the elders. And their number was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands.</verse>
  <verse number="12">In a loud voice they were saying: “Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing!”</verse>
  <verse number="13">And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, saying: “To Him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be praise and honor and glory and power forever and ever!”</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the four living creatures said, “Amen,” and the elders fell down and worshiped.</verse>
