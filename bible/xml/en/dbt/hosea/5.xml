  <verse number="1">Hear this, ye priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ear, O house of the king: for this judgment is for you; for ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And they have plunged themselves in the corruption of apostasy, but I will be a chastiser of them all.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me; for now, Ephraim, thou hast committed whoredom; Israel is defiled.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Their doings do not allow them to return unto their God; for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they know not Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Israel’s pride doth testify to his face; and Israel and Ephraim shall fall by their iniquity: Judah also shall fall with them.</verse>
  <verse number="6">They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah; but they shall not find [him]: he hath withdrawn himself from them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah; for they have begotten strange children: now shall the new moon devour them, with their allotted possessions.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Blow the horn in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah; cry aloud [at] Beth-aven: behind thee, O Benjamin!</verse>
  <verse number="9">Ephraim shall be a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which is sure.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The princes of Judah are become like them that remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, because in selfwill he walked after the commandment [of man].</verse>
  <verse number="12">And I will be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</verse>
  <verse number="13">When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his sore, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb; but he was unable to heal you, nor hath he removed your sore.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah. I, I will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I will go away, I will return to my place, till they acknowledge their trespass, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.</verse>
