<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The elder to the dearly beloved Gains, whom I love in truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Dearly beloved, I pray above all things that thou succeed and be in good health, as thy soul succeeds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I was greatly rejoiced, the brethren coming and testifying to thy truth, as thou walkest about in the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I have no joy greater than these that I hear my children walking in truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Dearly beloved, thou doest faithfully whatever thou dost work for the brethren, and for strangers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Who testified to thy love before the church: thou shalt do well, having sent them forward worthily of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For, for his name went they forth, receiving nothing from the nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Therefore ought we to receive such, that we might be workers together in the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I wrote to the church: but Diotrephes, seeking the superiority over them, receives us not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore, if I should come, I will put him in mind of his works which he does, talking silly against us with evil words: and not being satisfied in these, neither does he himself receive the brethren, and hinders those being willing, and casts out of the church.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Dearly beloved, imitate not evil, but good. He doing good is of God: and he doing evil has not seen God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">It has been testified to Demetrius by all, and by the truth itself: and we also testify; and know that our testimony is true.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">I have many things to write, but I will not by ink and pen write to thee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And I hope presently to see thee, and we will speak mouth to mouth. Peace to thee. The friends greet thee. Greet the friends by name.</p>
