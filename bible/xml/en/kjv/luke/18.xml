  <verse number="1">And he spake a parable unto them [to this end], that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;</verse>
  <verse number="2">Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;</verse>
  <verse number="5">Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge saith.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them?</verse>
  <verse number="8">I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men [are], extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as [his] eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified [rather] than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when [his] disciples saw [it], they rebuked them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But Jesus called them [unto him], and said, Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? none [is] good, save one, [that is], God.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Now when Jesus heard these things, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</verse>
  <verse number="25">For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And they that heard [it] said, Who then can be saved?</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then Peter said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake,</verse>
  <verse number="30">Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Then he took [unto him] the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:</verse>
  <verse number="33">And they shall scourge [him], and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:</verse>
  <verse number="36">And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And he cried, saying, Jesus, [thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, [Thou] Son of David, have mercy on me.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him,</verse>
  <verse number="41">Saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And Jesus said unto him, Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw [it], gave praise unto God.</verse>
