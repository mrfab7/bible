  <verse number="1">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, in mount Sinai, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, When ye shall come into the land which I gave to you, the land shall rest a Sabbath to Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather its produce;</verse>
  <verse number="4">And in the seventh year, a Sabbath of rest shall be to the land, a Sabbath to Jehovah: thy field thou shalt not sow, and thy vineyard thou shalt not prune.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The overflowing of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, and the grapes of thy separation thou shalt not gather: a year of the Sabbaths shall be to the land.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the Sabbath of the land shall be to you for food; to thee and to thy servant, and to thy maid, and to thy hireling, and to thine inhabitant sojourning with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And to thy cattle, and to the beast which is in thy land shall all its produce be for food.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And number to thee seven Sabbaths of years, seven years, seven times; and they shall be to thee the days of seven Sabbaths of years, nine and forty years.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And cause the trumpet of shouts of joy to pass over: in the seventh month, in the tenth of the month, in the day of expiations, shall ye cause the trumpet to pass over in all your land.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And consecrate the year, the fiftieth year, and call a letting go free in the land, to all inhabiting it: it shall be a jubilee to you; and return ye each to his possession, and each to his family shall ye turn back.</verse>
  <verse number="11">It a jubilee the year, the fiftieth year shall be to you: ye shall not sow and ye shall not reap its overflowings, and ye shall not gather its separations.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For it a jubilee; holy shall it be to you: from the field ye shall eat its produce.</verse>
  <verse number="13">In the year of this jubilee ye shall turn back each to his possession.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And when ye shall sell a selling to thy neighbor, or buying of thy neighbor’s hand, ye shall not oppress each his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="15">According to the number of years after the jubilee, thou shalt buy from thy neighbor; according to the number of the years produce shall he sell to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="16">According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase his purchase, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish his purchase: for from the numbering of the produce, he sold to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And ye shall not oppress each his neighbor; and thou shalt fear thy God: for I Jehovah your God.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And ye did my laws and watched my judgments and did them, and dwelt upon the land in confidence.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the land gave her fruits, and ye ate to satisfying, and ye dwelt in confidence upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And when ye shall say, What shall we eat in the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow and we shall not gather our produce.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And I commanded my blessing to you in the sixth year, and it made the produce for three years.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And ye sowed the eighth year, and ate from the old produce till the ninth year; till its produce came in ye shall eat the old.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And the land shall not be sold to be cut off, for the land is to me; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And in all the land of your possession ye shall give a redemption to the land.</verse>
  <verse number="25">When thy brother shall be poor, and he sold his possession, and he being near to him came to redeem it, and he redeemed the selling of his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And when to a man there shall be none to him to redeem, and his hand attained and found a sufficiency to redeem it;</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he reckoned the years of his selling, and he returned that remaining over to the man to whom he sold it, and turned back to his possession.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And if his hand found not a sufficiency to return to him, and his selling was in the hand of him buying it, till the year of the jubilee: and it went forth in the jubilee, and he turned back to his possession.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And when a man shall sell the house of dwelling in a walled city, its redemption of it shall be till it was completed: a year of days from its selling shall be its redemption.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And if it was not redeemed till the filling up of a complete year, and the house which is in the city, which, if walled, was set forever to him buying it for his generation: it shall not go forth in the jubilee.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the houses of the villages which to them not being walled round about, shall be reckoned for a field of the land: redemption shall be to it, and it shall go forth in the jubilee.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, redemption shall be always to the Levites.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And whoever shall redeem from the Levites, and the selling of the house and the city of his possession went out in the jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites, this their possession in the midst of the sons of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And the field of the area of their cities shall not be sold, for it is a possession to them forever.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And when thy brother shall be poor, and his hand wavering with thee, hold fast to him; a stranger and sojourner to live with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Thou shalt not take from him interest and increase; thou shalt be afraid of thy God; and thy brother to live with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Thy silver thou shalt not give to him upon interest, and upon increase thou shalt not give him thy food.</verse>
  <verse number="38">I am Jehovah your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give to you the land of Canaan, to be to you for God.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And when thy brother shall be poor with thee, and he was sold to thee, thou shalt not serve upon him the service of a servant.</verse>
  <verse number="40">As the hireling, as the sojourner, he shall be with thee; till the year of jubilee he shall serve with thee;</verse>
  <verse number="41">And he shall go forth from thee, he and his sons with him, and turn back to his family, to the possession of his fathers shall he turn back.</verse>
  <verse number="42">For they are my servants whom I brought them out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold from the sale of a servant.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Thou shalt not rule over him with crushing, and thou shalt be afraid of thy God.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And thy servant and thy maid which shall be to thee, from the nations which are round about you, from them ye shall buy servant and maid.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And from the sons of the sojourner sojourning with you, from them shall ye buy, and from their families which are with you, which were born in your land: and they were to you for a possession.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And ye shall possess them for your sons after you to take possession forever; ye shall serve with them: and over your brethren the sons of Israel, ye shall not rule over him, each over his brother with oppression.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And if the hand of a stranger and sojourner with thee shall attain, and thy brother with him be poor, and he sold to the stranger, a sojourner with thee, or to the root of the stranger’s family:</verse>
  <verse number="48">After the selling, redemption shall be to him; one from his brethren shall redeem him:</verse>
  <verse number="49">Or his uncle, or his uncle’s son shall redeem him, or from the remainder of his flesh from his family, shall redeem him; or his hand attained, and he redeemed himself.</verse>
  <verse number="50">And he reckoned with him buying him, from the year of his being sold to him till the year of the jubilee: and the silver of his selling was according to the number of years, as the days of a hireling, shall it be with him.</verse>
  <verse number="51">If yet a multitude of years, according to them he shall return his redemption from the silver of his sale.</verse>
  <verse number="52">And if a fewness remained to the years till the year of jubilee; and he reckoned to him according to his years, he shall return his redemption.</verse>
  <verse number="53">As the hireling of the year by the year shall he be with him: he shall not rule him by crushing to thine eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="54">And if he shall not be redeemed in these, and he shall go forth in the year of the jubilee, he and his sons with him.</verse>
  <verse number="55">For to me the sons of Israel are servants; they are my servants which I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt: I Jehovah your God.</verse>
