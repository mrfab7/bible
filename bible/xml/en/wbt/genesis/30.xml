  <verse number="1">And when Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister; and said to Jacob, Give me children, or else I die.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel; and he said, Am I in God’s stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?</verse>
  <verse number="3">And she said, Behold, my maid Bilhah, go in to her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And she gave him Bilhah, her handmaid, for a wife: and Jacob went in to her.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore she called his name Dan.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Bilhah, Rachel’s maid, conceived again, and bore Jacob a second son.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name Naphtali.</verse>
  <verse number="9">When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah, her maid, and gave her Jacob for a wife.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Zilpah, Leah’s maid, bore Jacob a son.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Zilpah, Leah’s maid, bore Jacob a second son.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name Asher.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Reuben went, in the days of wheat-harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s mandrakes.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And she said to her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son’s mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to-night for thy son’s mandrakes.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in to me; for surely I have hired thee with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And God hearkened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob the fifth son.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Leah conceived again, and bore Jacob the sixth son.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Leah said, God hath endowed me with a good dower; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have borne him six sons: and she called his name Zebulun.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And afterwards she bore a daughter, and called her name Dinah.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and rendered her fruitful.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And she conceived, and bore a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach:</verse>
  <verse number="24">And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD will add to me another son.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And it came to pass, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said to Laban, Send me away, that I may go to my own place, and to my country.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And Laban said to him, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience, that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he said to him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle were with me.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased to a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for my own house also?</verse>
  <verse number="31">And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing; if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock:</verse>
  <verse number="32">I will pass through all thy flock to-day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire.</verse>
  <verse number="33">So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be accounted stolen with me.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And he removed that day the he-goats that were ring-streaked and spotted, and all the she-goats that were speckled and spotted; every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hands of his sons.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And he set three days’ journey between himself and Jacob: and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And Jacob took to him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chesnut-tree; and peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And he set the rods, which he had peeled, before the flocks in the gutters in the watering-troughs, when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ring-streaked, speckled, and spotted.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks towards the ring-streaked, and all the brown in the flock of Laban: and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not with Laban’s cattle.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And it came to pass, whenever the stronger cattle conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods.</verse>
  <verse number="42">But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And the man increased exceedingly, and had many cattle, and maid-servants, and men-servants, and camels, and asses.</verse>
