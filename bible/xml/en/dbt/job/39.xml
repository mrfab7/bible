  <verse number="1">Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? dost thou mark the calving of the hinds?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Dost thou number the months that they fulfil? and knowest thou the time when they bring forth?</verse>
  <verse number="3">They bow themselves, they give birth to their young ones, they cast out their pains;</verse>
  <verse number="4">Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field, they go forth, and return not unto them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Who hath sent out the wild ass free? and who hath loosed the bands of the onager,</verse>
  <verse number="6">Whose house I made the wilderness, and the salt plain his dwellings?</verse>
  <verse number="7">He laugheth at the tumult of the city, and heareth not the shouts of the driver;</verse>
  <verse number="8">The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Will the buffalo be willing to serve thee, or will he lodge by thy crib?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Canst thou bind the buffalo with his cord in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Wilt thou put confidence in him, because his strength is great? and wilt thou leave thy labour to him?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Wilt thou trust him to bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy threshing-floor?</verse>
  <verse number="13">The wing of the ostrich beats joyously—But is it the stork’s pinion and plumage?</verse>
  <verse number="14">For she leaveth her eggs to the earth, and warmeth them in the dust,</verse>
  <verse number="15">And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the beast of the field may trample them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers; her labour is in vain, without her concern.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For +God hath deprived her of wisdom, and hath not furnished her with understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="18">What time she lasheth herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Hast thou given strength to the horse? hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Dost thou make him to leap as a locust? His majestic snorting is terrible.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in [his] strength; he goeth forth to meet the armed host.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He laugheth at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from before the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The quiver rattleth upon him, the glittering spear and the javelin.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage, and cannot contain himself at the sound of the trumpet:</verse>
  <verse number="25">At the noise of the trumpets he saith, Aha! and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Doth the hawk fly by thine intelligence, [and] stretch his wings toward the south?</verse>
  <verse number="27">Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make his nest on high?</verse>
  <verse number="28">He inhabiteth the rock and maketh his dwelling on the point of the cliff, and the fastness:</verse>
  <verse number="29">From thence he spieth out the prey, his eyes look into the distance;</verse>
  <verse number="30">And his young ones suck up blood; and where the slain are, there is he.</verse>
