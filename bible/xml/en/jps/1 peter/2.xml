  <verse number="1">Rid yourselves therefore of all ill-will and all deceitfulness, of insincerity and envy, and of all evil speaking.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thirst, like newly-born infants, for pure milk for the soul, that by it you may grow up to salvation;</verse>
  <verse number="3">if you have had any experience of the goodness of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Come to Him, the ever-living Stone, rejected indeed by men as worthless, but in God’s esteem chosen and held in honour.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And be yourselves also like living stones that are being built up into a spiritual house, to become a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For it is contained in Scripture, “See, I am placing on Mount Zion a Cornerstone, chosen, and held in honour, and he whose faith rests on Him shall never have reason to feel ashamed.”</verse>
  <verse number="7">To you believers, therefore, that honour belongs; but for unbelievers—“A Stone which the builders rejected has been made the Cornerstone,”</verse>
  <verse number="8">and “a Stone for the foot to strike against, and a Rock to stumble over.” Their foot strikes against it because they are disobedient to God’s Message, and to this they were appointed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But you are a chosen race, a priesthood of kingly lineage, a holy nation, a people belonging specially to God, that you may make known the perfections of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvellous light.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God. Once you had not found mercy, but now you have.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Dear friends, I entreat you as pilgrims and foreigners not to indulge the cravings of your lower natures: for all such cravings wage war upon the soul.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Live honourable lives among the Gentiles, in order that, although they now speak against you as evil-doers, they may yet witness your good conduct, and may glorify God on the day of reward and retribution.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Submit, for the Lord’s sake, to every authority set up by man, whether it be to the Emperor as supreme ruler,</verse>
  <verse number="14">or to provincial Governors as sent by him for the punishment of evil-doers and the encouragement of those who do what is right.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For it is God’s will that by doing what is right you should thus silence the ignorant talk of foolish persons.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Be free men, and yet do not make your freedom an excuse for base conduct, but be God’s bondservants.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Honour every one. Love the brotherhood, fear God, honour the Emperor.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Household servants, be submissive to your masters, and show them the utmost respect—not only if they are kind and thoughtful, but also if they are unreasonable.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For it is an acceptable thing with God, if, from a sense of duty to Him, a man patiently submits to wrong, when treated unjustly.</verse>
  <verse number="20">If you do wrong and receive a blow for it, what credit is there in your bearing it patiently? But if when you do right and suffer for it you bear it patiently, this is an acceptable thing with God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And it is to this you were called; because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you an example so that you should follow in His steps.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He never sinned, and no deceitful language was ever heard from His mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="23">When He was reviled, He did not answer with reviling; when He suffered He uttered no threats, but left His wrongs in the hands of the righteous Judge.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The burden of our sins He Himself carried in His own body to the Cross and bore it there, so that we, having died so far as our sins are concerned, may live righteous lives. By His wounds yours have been healed.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For you were straying like lost sheep, but now you have come back to the Shepherd and Protector of your souls.</verse>
