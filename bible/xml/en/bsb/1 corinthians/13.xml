<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="13" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a ringing gong or a clanging cymbal.</verse>
  <verse number="2">If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have absolute faith so as to move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="3">If I give all I possess to the poor and exult in the surrender of my body, but have not love, I gain nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.</verse>
  <verse number="5">It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no account of wrongs.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Love takes no pleasure in evil, but rejoices in the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="7">It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be restrained; where there is knowledge, it will be dismissed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For we know in part and we prophesy in part,</verse>
  <verse number="10">but when the perfect comes, the partial passes away.</verse>
  <verse number="11">When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I set aside childish ways.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now we see but a dim reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love; but the greatest of these is love.</verse>
