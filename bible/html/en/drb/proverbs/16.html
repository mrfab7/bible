<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="16" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">It is the part of man to prepare the soul: and of the Lord to govern the tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">All the ways of a man are open to his eyes: the Lord is the weigher of spirits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Lay open thy works to the Lord: and thy thoughts shall be directed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The Lord hath made all things for himself: the wicked also for the evil day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Every proud man is an abomination to the Lord: though hand should be joined to hand, he is not innocent. The beginning of a good way is to do justice; and this is more acceptable with God, than to offer sacrifices.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">By mercy and truth iniquity is redeemed: and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When the ways of man shall please the Lord, he will convert even his enemies to peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Better is a little with justice, than great revenues with iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The heart of man disposeth his way: but the Lord must direct his steps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Divination is in the lips of the king, his mouth shall not err in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Weight and balance are judgments of the Lord: and his work all the weights of the bag.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They that act wickedly are abominable to the king: for the throne is established by justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Just lips are the delight of kings: he that speaketh right things shall be loved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The wrath of a king is as messengers of death : and the wise man will pacify it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">In the cheerfulness of the kingâ€™s countenance is life: and his clemency is like the latter rain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Get wisdom, because it is better than gold: and purchase prudence, for it is more precious than silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The path of the just departeth from evils: he that keepeth his soul keepeth his way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Pride goeth before destruction: and the spirit is lifted up before a fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">It is better to be humbled with the meek, than to divide spoils with the proud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The learned in word shall find good things: and he that trusteth in the Lord is blessed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and he that is sweet in words shall attain to greater things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Knowledge is a fountain of life to him that possesseth it: the instruction of fools is foolishness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The heart of the wise shall instruct his mouth: and shall add grace to his lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Well ordered words are as a honeycomb: sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">There is a way that seemeth to a man right: and the ends thereof lead to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The soul of him that laboureth, laboureth for himself, because his mouth hath obliged him to it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The wicked man diggeth evil, and in his lips is a burning fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A perverse man stirreth up quarrels: and one full of words separateth princes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">An unjust man allureth his friend: and leadeth him into a way that is not good</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He that with fixed eyes deviseth?? wicked things, biting his lips, bringeth: evil to pass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Old age is a crown of dignity, when it is found in the ways of justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">The patient man is better than the valiant: and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh cities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Lots are cast into the lap, but they are disposed of by the Lord.</p>
