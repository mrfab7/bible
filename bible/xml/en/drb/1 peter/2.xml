<chapter book="1 Peter" number="2" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Wherefore laying away all malice, and all guile, and dissimulations, and envies, and all detractions,</verse>
  <verse number="2">As newborn babes, desire the rational milk without guile, that thereby you may grow unto salvation:</verse>
  <verse number="3">If so be you have tasted that the Lord is sweet.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Unto whom coming, as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen and made honourable by God:</verse>
  <verse number="5">Be you also as living stones built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Wherefore it is said in the scripture: Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious. And he that shall believe in him, shall not be confounded.</verse>
  <verse number="7">To you therefore that believe, he is honour: but to them that believe not, the stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner:</verse>
  <verse number="8">And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of scandal, to them who stumble at the word, neither do believe, whereunto also they are set.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But you are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a purchased people: that you may declare his virtues, who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Who in time past were not a people: but are now the people of God. Who had not obtained mercy; but now have obtained mercy.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, to refrain yourselves from carnal desires which war against the soul,</verse>
  <verse number="12">Having your conversation good among the Gentiles: that whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by the good works, which they shall behold in you, glorify God in the day of visitation.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Be ye subject therefore to every human creature for God’s sake: whether it be to the king as excelling;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of the good:</verse>
  <verse number="15">For so is the will of God, that by doing well you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</verse>
  <verse number="16">As free, and not as making liberty a cloak for malice, but as the servants of God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For this is thankworthy, if for conscience towards God, a man endure sorrows, suffering wrongfully.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For what glory is it, if committing sin, and being buffeted for it, you endure? But if doing well you suffer patiently; this is thankworthy before God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For unto this are you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example that you should follow his steps.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Who, when he was reviled, did not revile: when he suffered, he threatened not: but delivered himself to him that judged him unjustly.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Who his own self bore our sins in his body upon the tree: that we, being dead to sins, should live to justice: by whose stripes you were healed.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For you were as sheep going astray; but you are now converted to the shepherd and bishop of your souls.</verse>
