  <verse number="4">If thou seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures;</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For the LORD giveth wisdom; out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding:</verse>
  <verse number="7">He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright, he is a shield to them that walk in integrity;</verse>
  <verse number="8">That he may guard the paths of judgment, and preserve the way of his saints.</verse>
