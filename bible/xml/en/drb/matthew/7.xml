  <verse number="1">JUDGE not, that you may not be judged,</verse>
  <verse number="2">For with what judgment you judge, you shall be judged: and with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Any why seest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye; and seest not the beam that is in thy own eye?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Or how sayest thou to thy brother: Let me cast the mote out of thy eye; and behold a beam is in thy own eye?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thou hypocrite, cast out first the beam in thy own eye, and then shalt thou see to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Give not that which is holy to dogs; neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest perhaps they trample them under their feet, and turning upon you, they tear you.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Ask, and it shall be given you: seek, and you shall find: knock, and it shall be opened to you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For every one that asketh, receiveth: and he that seeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Or what man is there among you, of whom if his son shall ask bread, will he reach him a stone?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Or if he shall ask him a fish, will he reach him a serpent?</verse>
  <verse number="11">If you then being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more will your Father who is in heaven, give good things to them that ask him?</verse>
  <verse number="12">All things therefore whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do you also to them. For this is the law and the prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Enter ye in at the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in thereat.</verse>
  <verse number="14">How narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that leadeth to life: and few there are that find it!</verse>
  <verse number="15">Beware of false prophets, who come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</verse>
  <verse number="16">By their fruits you shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</verse>
  <verse number="17">Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, and the evil tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="18">A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can an evil tree bring forth good fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit, shall be cut down, and shall be cast into the fire.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven: but he that doth the will of my Father who is in heaven, he shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Many will say to me in that day: Lord, Lord, have not we prophesied in thy name, and cast out devils in thy name, and done many miracles in thy name?</verse>
  <verse number="23">And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, you that work iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Every one therefore that heareth these my words, and doth them, shall be likened to a wise man that built his house upon a rock,</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded on a rock.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And every one that heareth these my words, and doth them not, shall be like a foolish man that built his house upon the sand,</verse>
  <verse number="27">And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat upon that house, and it fell, and great was the fall thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And it came to pass when Jesus had fully ended these words, the people were in admiration at his doctrine.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes and Pharisees.</verse>
