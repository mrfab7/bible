  <verse number="1">The word that Yahweh spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Declare among the nations and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and don’t conceal: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is disappointed, Merodach is dismayed; her images are disappointed, her idols are dismayed.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For out of the north there comes up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they are fled, they are gone, both man and animal.</verse>
  <verse number="4">In those days, and in that time, says Yahweh, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together; they shall go on their way weeping, and shall seek Yahweh their God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces turned toward it, saying, Come, and join yourselves to Yahweh in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten.</verse>
  <verse number="6">My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains; they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their resting place.</verse>
  <verse number="7">All who found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said, We are not guilty, because they have sinned against Yahweh, the habitation of righteousness, even Yahweh, the hope of their fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the male goats before the flocks.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For, behold, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon a company of great nations from the north country; and they shall set themselves in array against her; from there she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man; none shall return in vain.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Chaldea shall be a prey: all who prey on her shall be satisfied, says Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Because you are glad, because you rejoice, O you who plunder my heritage, because you are wanton as a heifer that treads out the grain, and neigh as strong horses;</verse>
  <verse number="12">your mother shall be utterly disappointed; she who bore you shall be confounded: behold, she shall be the least of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Because of the wrath of Yahweh she shall not be inhabited, but she shall be wholly desolate: everyone who goes by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Set yourselves in array against Babylon all around, all you who bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she has sinned against Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Shout against her all around: she has submitted herself; her bulwarks are fallen, her walls are thrown down; for it is the vengeance of Yahweh: take vengeance on her; as she has done, do to her.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him who handles the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn everyone to his people, and they shall flee everyone to his own land.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Israel is a hunted sheep; the lions have driven him away: first, the king of Assyria devoured him; and now at last Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel: Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.</verse>
  <verse number="19">I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied on the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.</verse>
  <verse number="20">In those days, and in that time, says Yahweh, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: kill and utterly destroy after them, says Yahweh, and do according to all that I have commanded you.</verse>
  <verse number="22">A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.</verse>
  <verse number="23">How is the hammer of the whole earth cut apart and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!</verse>
  <verse number="24">I have laid a snare for you, and you are also taken, Babylon, and you weren’t aware: you are found, and also caught, because you have striven against Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Yahweh has opened his armory, and has brought forth the weapons of his indignation; for the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, has a work to do in the land of the Chaldeans.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Come against her from the utmost border; open her storehouses; cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly; let nothing of her be left.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Kill all her bulls; let them go down to the slaughter: woe to them! for their day has come, the time of their visitation.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The voice of those who flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Yahweh our God, the vengeance of his temple.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Call together the archers against Babylon, all those who bend the bow; encamp against her all around; let none of it escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she has done, do to her; for she has been proud against Yahweh, against the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Therefore her young men will fall in her streets, and all her men of war will be brought to silence in that day, says Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Behold, I am against you, you proud one, says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies; for your day has come, the time that I will visit you.</verse>
  <verse number="32">The proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up; and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all who are around him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Thus says Yahweh of Armies: The children of Israel and the children of Judah are oppressed together; and all who took them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Their Redeemer is strong; Yahweh of Armies is his name: he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.</verse>
  <verse number="35">A sword is on the Chaldeans, says Yahweh, and on the inhabitants of Babylon, and on her princes, and on her wise men.</verse>
  <verse number="36">A sword is on the boasters, and they shall become fools; a sword is on her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.</verse>
  <verse number="37">A sword is on their horses, and on their chariots, and on all the mixed people who are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is on her treasures, and they shall be robbed.</verse>
  <verse number="38">A drought is on her waters, and they shall be dried up; for it is a land of engraved images, and they are mad over idols.</verse>
  <verse number="39">Therefore the wild animals of the desert with the wolves shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited forever; neither shall it be lived in from generation to generation.</verse>
  <verse number="40">As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor cities of it, says Yahweh, so shall no man dwell there, neither shall any son of man live therein.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Behold, a people comes from the north; and a great nation and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="42">They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea; and they ride on horses, everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you, daughter of Babylon.</verse>
  <verse number="43">The king of Babylon has heard the news of them, and his hands wax feeble: anguish has taken hold of him, pains as of a woman in labor.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Behold, the enemy shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation: for I will suddenly make them run away from it; and whoever is chosen, him will I appoint over it: for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is the shepherd who can stand before me?</verse>
  <verse number="45">Therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh, that he has taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he has purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely they shall drag them away, even the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make their habitation desolate over them.</verse>
  <verse number="46">At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembles, and the cry is heard among the nations.</verse>
