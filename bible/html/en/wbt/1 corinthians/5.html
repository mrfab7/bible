<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="5" data-translation="Webster Bible Translation" data-translation-id="wbt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">It is reported commonly that there is lewdness among you, and such lewdness as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his fatherâ€™s wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he who hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are assembled, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">To deliver such one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Your boasting is not good. Know ye not, that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Cleanse out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I have written to you in this epistle, not to associate with persons guilty of lewdness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Yet not altogether with lewd persons of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters: for then ye must needs go out of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother is a lewd person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner: with such person no not to eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do ye not judge them that are within?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</p>
