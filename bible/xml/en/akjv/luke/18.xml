  <verse number="1">And he spoke a parable to them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint;</verse>
  <verse number="2">Saying, There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And there was a widow in that city; and she came to him, saying, Avenge me of my adversary.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man;</verse>
  <verse number="5">Yet because this widow troubles me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge said.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night to him, though he bear long with them?</verse>
  <verse number="8">I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man comes, shall he find faith on the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he spoke this parable to certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you, that I am not as other men are, extortionists, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but smote on his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalts himself shall be abased; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And they brought to him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But Jesus called them to him, and said, Suffer little children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Truly I say to you, Whoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Jesus said to him, Why call you me good? none is good, save one, that is, God.</verse>
  <verse number="20">You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and your mother.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Now when Jesus heard these things, he said to him, Yet lack you one thing: sell all that you have, and distribute to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!</verse>
  <verse number="25">For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved?</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then Peter said, See, we have left all, and followed you.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he said to them, Truly I say to you, There is no man that has left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake,</verse>
  <verse number="30">Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Then he took to him the twelve, and said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on:</verse>
  <verse number="33">And they shall whip him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And it came to pass, that as he was come near to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging:</verse>
  <verse number="36">And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth passes by.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And he cried, saying, Jesus, you son of David, have mercy on me.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, You son of David, have mercy on me.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought to him: and when he was come near, he asked him,</verse>
  <verse number="41">Saying, What will you that I shall do to you? And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And Jesus said to him, Receive your sight: your faith has saved you.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.</verse>
