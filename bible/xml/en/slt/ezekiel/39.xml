  <verse number="1">And thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against thee, O Gog, prince of the head of Meshech and Tubal:</verse>
  <verse number="2">And I turned thee back, and I led thee, and I caused thee to come up from the thighs of the north, and I brought thee upon the mountains of Israel:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I struck thy bow out of thy left hand, and thine arrows will I cause to fall from thy right hand.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Upon the mountains of Israel shalt thou fall, thou and all thy hosts, and the peoples which are with thee: to the ravenous bird, the bird of every wing, and to the beasts of the field I gave to consume.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Upon the face of the field thou shalt fall: for I spake, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And I sent a fire upon Magog, and upon them dwelling with confidence in the islands: and they knew that I am Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And I will make known my holy name in the midst of my people Israel; and I will no more profane my holy name: and the nations shall know that am Jehovah, the Holy One in Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Behold, it came, and it was, says the Lord Jehovah; this the day which I spake.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they dwelling in the cities of Israel went forth and kindled and set on fire with the weapons and the shield and the buckler, with the bow and with the arrows, and with the rods of the hand and with the spear, and they burnt a fire with them seven years:</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they shall not lift up wood from the field, and they shall not cut down from the forests; for they shall kindle fire with the weapons, and they spoiled those spoiling them, and they plundered those plundering them, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it was in that day, I will give to Gog a place there, a sepulchre in Israel, the valley of those passing through east of the sea: and it stopped those passing by: and they buried there Gog, and all his multitude: and they called the valley, The Multitude.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the house of Israel buried them to cleanse the land seven months.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And they buried all the people of the land: and it was to them for name the day of honoring me; says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And they shall separate men continually, passing through in the land burying those transported with those remaining upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: from the end of seven months they shall search.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And they caused to pass through, passed through in the land, and he seeing a bone of man and he built a pillar by it, they burying, buried it in the valley of the multitude of Gog.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And also the name of the city, The Multitude. And they cleansed the land.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And thou, son of man, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Say to the bird of every wing and to all the beasts of the field, Gather yourselves together, and come; assemble yourselves from round about to my sacrifice which I sacrifice to you, a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel; and ye ate flesh and drank blood.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The flesh of the strong shall ye eat, and the blood of the princes of the earth shall ye drink, rams, lambs and he goats, bullocks being fattened, of Bashan all of them.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And ye ate fat to satiety, and ye drank blood to drunkenness, from my sacrifice which I sacrificed for you.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And ye were satiated at my table with horse and chariot, with the strong, and every man of war, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And I gave my honor among the nations, and all the nations saw my judgments which I did, and my hand that I put upon them.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the house of Israel knew that I am Jehovah their God, from this day and farther.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And the nations shall know that for their iniquity the house of Israel were carried away captive: because they transgressed against me, and I will hide my face from them, and I will give them into the hand of their enemies, and they shall fall by the sword, all of them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">According to their uncleanness and according to their transgressions I did with them, and I will hide my face from them.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Now will I turn back the captivity of Jacob, and I compassionated all the house of Israel, and I was jealous for my holy name.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And they bare their shame and all their transgression which they transgressed against me, in their dwelling upon their land confidently, and none terrifying.</verse>
  <verse number="27">In my turning them back from the peoples, and I gathered them from the lands of their enemies, and I was consecrated in them before the eyes of many nations;</verse>
  <verse number="28">And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God in my carrying them captive to the nations: and I collected them into their land, and I will no more leave from them there.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And I will no more bide my face from them, for I poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
