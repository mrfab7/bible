<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Make thee two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shalt thou make them; and they shall serve for the calling together of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And when they shall blow with them, the whole assembly shall gather to thee at the entrance of the tent of meeting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And if they blow with one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And when ye blow an alarm, the camps that lie eastward shall set forward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And when ye blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie southward shall set forward; they shall blow an alarm on their setting forward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not blow an alarm:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an everlasting statute throughout your generations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before Jehovah your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in your new moons, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings and over your sacrifices of peace-offering; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God: I am Jehovah your God.</p>
