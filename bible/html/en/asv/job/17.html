<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct, The grave is ready for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Surely there are mockers with me, And mine eye dwelleth upon their provocation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Give now a pledge, be surety for me with thyself; Who is there that will strike hands with me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: Therefore shalt thou not exalt them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He that denounceth his friends for a prey, Even the eyes of his children shall fail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But he hath made me a byword of the people; And they spit in my face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, And all my members are as a shadow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Upright men shall be astonished at this, And the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Yet shall the righteous hold on his way, And he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But as for you all, come on now again; And I shall not find a wise man among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My days are past, my purposes are broken off, Even the thoughts of my heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They change the night into day: The light, say they, is near unto the darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I look for Sheol as my house; If I have spread my couch in the darkness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If I have said to corruption, Thou art my father; To the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Where then is my hope? And as for my hope, who shall see it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">It shall go down to the bars of Sheol, When once there is rest in the dust.</p>
