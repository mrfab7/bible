  <verse number="2">and he saith to his mother, ‘The eleven hundred silverlings which have been taken of thine, and of which thou hast sworn, and also spoken in mine ears; lo, the silver is with me, I have taken it;’ and his mother saith, ‘Blessed is my son of Jehovah.’</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he giveth back the eleven hundred silverlings to his mother, and his mother saith, ‘I had certainly sanctified the silver to Jehovah, from my hand, for my son, to make a graven image, and a molten image; and now, I give it back to thee.’</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he giveth back the money to his mother, and his mother taketh two hundred silverlings, and giveth them to a refiner, and he maketh them a graven image, and a molten image, and it is in the house of Micah.</verse>
  <verse number="5">As to the man Micah, he hath a house of gods, and he maketh an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrateth the hand of one of his sons, and he is to him for a priest;</verse>
