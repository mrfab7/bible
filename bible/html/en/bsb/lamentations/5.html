<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Remember, O LORD, what has happened to us. Look and see our disgrace!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our houses to foreigners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">We have become fatherless orphans; our mothers are widows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">We must buy the water we drink; our wood comes at a price.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">We are closely pursued; we are weary and find no rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">We submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Our fathers sinned and are no more, but we bear their punishment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Slaves rule over us; there is no one to deliver us from their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">We get our bread at the risk of our lives because of the sword in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Our skin is as hot as an oven with fever from our hunger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Women have been ravished in Zion, virgins in the cities of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Princes have been hung up by their hands; elders receive no respect.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Young men toil at millstones; boys stagger under loads of wood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The elders have left the city gate; the young men have stopped their music.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Joy has left our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The crown has fallen from our head. Woe to us, for we have sinned!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Because of this, our hearts are faint; because of these, our eyes grow dimâ€”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">because of Mount Zion, which lies desolate, patrolled by foxes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">You, O LORD, reign forever; Your throne endures from generation to generation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Why have You forgotten us forever? Why have You forsaken us for so long?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Restore us to Yourself, O LORD, so we may return; renew our days as of old,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">unless You have utterly rejected us and remain angry with us beyond measure.</p>
