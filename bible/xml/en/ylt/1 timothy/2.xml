<chapter book="1 Timothy" number="2" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">I exhort, then, first of all, there be made supplications, prayers, intercessions, thanksgivings, for all men:</verse>
  <verse number="2">for kings, and all who are in authority, that a quiet and peaceable life we may lead in all piety and gravity,</verse>
  <verse number="3">for this is right and acceptable before God our Saviour,</verse>
  <verse number="4">who doth will all men to be saved, and to come to the full knowledge of the truth;</verse>
  <verse number="5">for one is God, one also is mediator of God and of men, the man Christ Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="6">who did give himself a ransom for all—the testimony in its own times—</verse>
  <verse number="7">in regard to which I was set a preacher and apostle—truth I say in Christ, I do not lie—a teacher of nations, in faith and truth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I wish, therefore, that men pray in every place, lifting up kind hands, apart from anger and reasoning;</verse>
  <verse number="9">in like manner also the women, in becoming apparel, with modesty and sobriety to adorn themselves, not in braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or garments of great price,</verse>
  <verse number="10">but—which becometh women professing godly piety—through good works.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Let a woman in quietness learn in all subjection,</verse>
  <verse number="12">and a woman I do not suffer to teach, nor to rule a husband, but to be in quietness,</verse>
  <verse number="13">for Adam was first formed, then Eve,</verse>
  <verse number="14">and Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, into transgression came,</verse>
  <verse number="15">and she shall be saved through the child-bearing, if they remain in faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety.</verse>
