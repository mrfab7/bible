<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How long will ye hunt for words? Consider, and afterwards we will speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Wherefore are we counted as beasts, And are become unclean in your sight?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger, Shall the earth be forsaken for thee? Or shall the rock be removed out of its place?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, And the spark of his fire shall not shine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The light shall be dark in his tent, And his lamp above him shall be put out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The steps of his strength shall be straitened, And his own counsel shall cast him down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For he is cast into a net by his own feet, And he walketh upon the toils.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A gin shall take him by the heel, And a snare shall lay hold on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A noose is hid for him in the ground, And a trap for him in the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, And shall chase him at his heels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">His strength shall be hunger-bitten, And calamity shall be ready at his side.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The members of his body shall be devoured, Yea, the first-born of death shall devour his members.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He shall be rooted out of his tent where he trusteth; And he shall be brought to the king of terrors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his: Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">His roots shall be dried up beneath, And above shall his branch be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">His remembrance shall perish from the earth, And he shall have no name in the street.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He shall be driven from light into darkness, And chased out of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He shall have neither son nor sonâ€™s son among his people, Nor any remaining where he sojourned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">They that come after shall be astonished at his day, As they that went before were affrighted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous, And this is the place of him that knoweth not God.</p>
