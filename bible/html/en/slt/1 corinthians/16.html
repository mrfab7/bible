<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And concerning the collection for the holy ones, as I appointed to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">According to one day of the sabbaths let each of you put by himself, treasuring up that which he is prospered in, that when I come there be no collections.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And when I be present, whom ye approve by letters, these will I send to carry your grace to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And if it be suitable for me also to go, they shall go with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And I will come to you, when I pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And perhaps with you I shall abide, or also pass the winter, that ye might send me forward wherever I go.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For I will not see you now in coming forward; but I hope to remain some time with you, if the Lord permit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And I will remain in Ephesus even till Pentecost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For a door has stood open to me, great and effective, and many opposed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And if Timotheus come, see ye that he be with you fearlessly: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Therefore no one should despise him: and send ye him forward in peace, that he might come to me: for I expect him with the brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And concerning Apollos, the brother, I besought him much that he would come to you with the brethren: and the will was not altogether that he should come now; and he will come when he should have leisure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Watch ye, stand in the faith, be manly, be strengthened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Let all things be in love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And I beseech you brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and they arranged themselves for service to the holy ones,)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">That also ye be subjected to such, and to every one cooperating, and to the wearied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And I rejoice at the arrival of Stephanas and Fortunatus and: that they have filled up your necessity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For they refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore observe ye such.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla, with the church at their house, greet you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with a holy kiss.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The greeting of Paul by my hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">If any love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ with you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">My love with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
