<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="13" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">This third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every matter be established.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I have declared beforehand, and I say beforehand as present the second time, and now absent, to those that have sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, (who is not weak towards you, but is powerful among you,</verse>
  <verse number="4">for if indeed he has been crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God’s power; for indeed we are weak in him, but we shall live with him by God’s power towards you,)</verse>
  <verse number="5">examine your own selves if ye be in the faith; prove your own selves: do ye not recognise yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless indeed ye be reprobates?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now I hope that ye will know that we are not reprobates.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But we pray to God that ye may do nothing evil; not that we may appear approved, but that ye may do what is right, and we be as reprobates.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For we rejoice when we may be weak and ye may be powerful. But this also we pray for, your perfecting.</verse>
  <verse number="10">On this account I write these things being absent, that being present I may not use severity according to the authority which the Lord has given me for building up, and not for overthrowing.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the rest, brethren, rejoice; be perfected; be encouraged; be of one mind; be at peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Salute one another with a holy kiss.</verse>
  <verse number="13">All the saints salute you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, [be] with you all.</verse>
