<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I made a covenant with mine eyes; and how should I fix my regard upon a maid?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For what would have been [my] portion of +God from above, and what the heritage of the Almighty from on high?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is not calamity for the unrighteous? and misfortune for the workers of iniquity?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Doth not he see my ways, and number all my steps?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If I have walked with falsehood, and my foot hath hasted to deceit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">(Let me be weighed in an even balance, and +God will take knowledge of my blamelessness;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If my step have turned out of the way, and my heart followed mine eyes, and if any blot cleaveth to my hands;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Let me sow, and another eat; and let mine offspring be rooted out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">If my heart have been enticed unto a woman, so that I laid wait at my neighbour’s door,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Let my wife grind for another, and let others bow down upon her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For this is an infamy; yea, it is an iniquity [to be judged by] the judges:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I have despised the cause of my bondman or of my bondmaid, when they contended with me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What then should I do when God riseth up? and if he visited, what should I answer him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not One fashion us in the womb?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If I have withheld the poor from [their] desire, or caused the eyes of the widow to fail;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Or have eaten my morsel alone, so that the fatherless ate not thereof,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">(For from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, and I have guided the [widow] from my mother’s womb;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If I have seen any perishing for want of clothing, or any needy without covering;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my lambs;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">If I have lifted up my hand against an orphan, because I saw my help in the gate:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">[Then] let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For calamity from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his excellency I was powerless.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">If I have made gold my hope, or said to the fine gold, My confidence!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because my hand had gotten much;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">If I beheld the sun when it shone, or the moon walking in brightness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And my heart have been secretly enticed, so that my mouth kissed my hand:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">This also would be an iniquity for the judge, for I should have denied the God who is above.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, and exulted when evil befell him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">(Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">If the men of my tent said not, Who shall find one that hath not been satisfied with his meat?—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">The stranger did not lodge without; I opened my doors to the pathway.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Because I feared the great multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and went not out of the door,...</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Oh that I had one to hear me! Behold my signature: let the Almighty answer me! And let mine opponent write an accusation!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Would I not take it upon my shoulder? I would bind it on to me [as] a crown;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I come near to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">If my land cry out against me, and its furrows weep together;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, and have tormented to death the souls of its owners:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and tares instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.</p>
