  <verse number="1">Then Job answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">I have heard many such things: miserable comforters [are] ye all.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?</verse>
  <verse number="4">I also could speak as ye [do]: if your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">[But] I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage [your grief].</verse>
  <verse number="6">Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and [though] I forbear, what am I eased?</verse>
  <verse number="7">But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, [which] is a witness [against me]: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He teareth [me] in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken [me] by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.</verse>
  <verse number="13">His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="16">My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids [is] the shadow of death;</verse>
  <verse number="17">Not for [any] injustice in mine hands: also my prayer [is] pure.</verse>
  <verse number="18">O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Also now, behold, my witness [is] in heaven, and my record [is] on high.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My friends scorn me: [but] mine eye poureth out [tears] unto God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man [pleadeth] for his neighbour!</verse>
  <verse number="22">When a few years are come, then I shall go the way [whence] I shall not return.</verse>
