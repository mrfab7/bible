<p class="verse" data-verse="1">This third I come to you. By mouth of two witnesses, and three, shall every word be established.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I have said before, and say beforehand, as being present the second; and being away now I write to them having sinned before, and to all the rest, that, if I should come again, I will not spare:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Since seek proof of Christ speaking in me, who to you is no weak, but has power in you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For also if he was crucified from weakness, but he lives from the power of God. For also we are weak in him, but we live with him from the power of God to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Try yourselves, if ye are in the faith; prove yourselves. Or know ye not yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless ye are not tried?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And I hope that ye shall know that we are not untried.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I pray to God that ye do nothing evil; not that we appear tried, but that ye do good, and we be as untried.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For we are not able anything against the truth, but for the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For we rejoice when we be weak, and ye be able: and this also we pray, your restoration.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For this I write these things being absent, that being present I should not wound severely, according to the power which the Lord gave me for building up, and not for pulling down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">As to the rest, brethren, rejoice. Be adjusted, be comforted, think the same, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Greet ye one another in a holy kiss.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">All the holy ones greet you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit with you all. Amen.</p>
