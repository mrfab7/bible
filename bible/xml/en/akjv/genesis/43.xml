  <verse number="1">And the famine was sore in the land.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, Go again, buy us a little food.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Judah spoke to him, saying, The man did solemnly protest to us, saying, You shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.</verse>
  <verse number="4">If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy you food:</verse>
  <verse number="5">But if you will not send him, we will not go down: for the man said to us, You shall not see my face, except your brother be with you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Israel said, Why dealt you so ill with me, as to tell the man whether you had yet a brother?</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they said, The man asked us straightly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have you another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Judah said to Israel his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and you, and also our little ones.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I will be surety for him; of my hand shall you require him: if I bring him not to you, and set him before you, then let me bear the blame for ever:</verse>
  <verse number="10">For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:</verse>
  <verse number="12">And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:</verse>
  <verse number="13">Take also your brother, and arise, go again to the man:</verse>
  <verse number="14">And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the men were afraid, because they were brought into Joseph’s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall on us, and take us for slaves, and our asses.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they communed with him at the door of the house,</verse>
  <verse number="20">And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food:</verse>
  <verse number="21">And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought Simeon out to them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he yet alive?</verse>
  <verse number="28">And they answered, Your servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom you spoke to me? And he said, God be gracious to you, my son.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn on his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marveled one at another.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And he took and sent messes to them from before him: but Benjamin’s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.</verse>
