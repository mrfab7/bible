  <verse number="1">AND when the days of the Pentecost were accomplished, they were all together in one place:</verse>
  <verse number="2">And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty wind coming, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And there appeared to them parted tongues as it were of fire, and it sat upon every one of them:</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they began to speak with divers tongues, according as the Holy Ghost gave them to speak.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded in mind, because that every man heard them speak in his own tongue.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they were all amazed, and wondered, saying: Behold, are not all these, that speak, Galileans?</verse>
  <verse number="8">And how have we heard, every man our own tongue wherein we were born?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and inhabitants of Mesopotamia, Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,</verse>
  <verse number="10">Phrygia, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome,</verse>
  <verse number="11">Jews also, and proselytes, Cretes, and Arabians: we have heard them speak in our own tongues the wonderful works of God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they were all astonished, and wondered, saying one to another: What meaneth this?</verse>
  <verse number="13">But others mocking, said: These men are full of new wine.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But Peter standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and spoke to them: Ye men of Judea, and all you that dwell in Jerusalem, be this known to you, and with your ears receive my words.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For these are not drunk, as you suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day:</verse>
  <verse number="16">But this is that which was spoken of by the prophet Joel:</verse>
  <verse number="17">And it shall come to pass, in the last days, (saith the Lord,) I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And upon my servants indeed, and upon my handmaids will I pour out in those days of my spirit, and they shall prophesy.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And I will shew wonders in the heaven above, and signs on the earth beneath: blood and fire, and vapour of smoke.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and manifest day of the Lord come.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, shall be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, by miracles, and wonders, and signs, which God did by him, in the midst of you, as you also know:</verse>
  <verse number="23">This same being delivered up, by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you by the hands of wicked men have crucified and slain.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the sorrows of hell, as it was impossible that he should be holden by it.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For David saith concerning him: I foresaw the Lord before my face: because he is at my right hand, that I may not be moved.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For this my heart hath been glad, and any tongue hath rejoiced: moreover my flesh also shall rest in hope.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, nor suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Thou hast made known to me the ways of life: thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Ye men, brethren, let me freely speak to you of the patriarch David; that he died, and was buried; and his sepulchre is with us to this present day.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Whereas therefore he was a prophet, and knew that God hath sworn to him with an oath, that of the fruit of his loins one should sit upon his throne.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Foreseeing this, he spoke of the resurrection of Christ. For neither was he left in hell, neither did his flesh see corruption.</verse>
  <verse number="32">This Jesus hath God raised again, whereof all we are witnesses.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Being exalted therefore by the right hand of God, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath poured forth this which you see and hear.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For David ascended not into heaven; but he himself said: The Lord said to my Lord, sit thou on my right hand,</verse>
  <verse number="35">Until I make thy enemies thy footstool.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Therefore let all the house of Israel know most certainly, that God hath made both Lord and Christ, this same Jesus, whom you have crucified.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Now when they had heard these things, they had compunction in their heart, and said to Peter, and to the rest of the apostles: What shall we do, men and brethren?</verse>
  <verse number="38">But Peter said to them: Do penance, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins: and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
  <verse number="39">For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are far off, whomsoever the Lord our God shall call.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And with very many other words did he testify and exhort them, saying: Save yourselves from this perverse generation.</verse>
  <verse number="41">They therefore that received his word, were baptized; and there were added in that day about three thousand souls.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And they were persevering in the doctrine of the apostles, and in the communication of the breaking of bread, and in prayers.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And fear came upon every soul: many wonders also and signs were done by the apostles in Jerusalem, and there was great fear in all.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And all they that believed, were together, and had all things common.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Their possessions and goods they sold, and divided them to all, according as every one had need.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they took their meat with gladness and simplicity of heart;</verse>
  <verse number="47">Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord increased daily together such as should be saved.</verse>
