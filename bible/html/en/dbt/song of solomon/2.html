<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I am a narcissus of Sharon, A lily of the valleys.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As the lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, So is my beloved among the sons: In his shadow have I rapture and sit down; And his fruit is sweet to my taste.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He hath brought me to the house of wine, And his banner over me is love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Sustain ye me with raisin-cakes, Refresh me with apples; For I am sick of love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">His left hand is under my head, And his right hand doth embrace me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles, or by the hinds of the field, That ye stir not up, nor awake [my] love, till he please.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The voice of my beloved! Behold, he cometh Leaping upon the mountains, Skipping upon the hills.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart. Behold, he standeth behind our wall, He looketh in through the windows, Glancing through the lattice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">My beloved spake and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For behold, the winter is past, The rain is over, it is gone:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The flowers appear on the earth; The time of singing is come, And the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The fig-tree melloweth her winter figs, And the vines in bloom give forth [their] fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">My dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the covert of the precipice, Let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; For sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Take us the foxes, The little foxes, that spoil the vineyards; For our vineyards are in bloom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">My beloved is mine, and I am his; He feedeth [his flock] among the lilies,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Until the day dawn, and the shadows flee away. Turn, my beloved: be thou like a gazelle or a young hart, Upon the mountains of Bether.</p>
