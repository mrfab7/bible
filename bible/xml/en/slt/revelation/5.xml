<chapter book="Revelation" number="5" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And I saw upon the right hand of him sitting upon the throne, a book written within and behind, sealed with seven seals.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose its seals?</verse>
  <verse number="3">And none was able in heaven, nor upon earth, nor under the earth, to open the book, nor to look upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And I wept much, that none was found worthy to open and to read the hook, neither to look upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And one of the elders says to me, Weep not: behold, the Lion conquered, he being of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, to open the book, and to loose its seven seals.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And I saw, and, behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent into all the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he came and took the book from the right hand of him sitting upon the throne.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And when he took the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, having each harps, and golden bowls full of incenses, which are the prayers of the holy.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they sing a new song, saying, Worthy art thou to take the book, and to open its seals: for thou wert slain, and didst purchase us to God by thy blood from every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation;</verse>
  <verse number="10">And madest us kings and priests to our God: and we shall reign upon the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And I saw, and heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the living creatures and the elders: and their number was myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands;</verse>
  <verse number="12">Saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb slain to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and praise.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And every creature which is in heaven, and in earth, and under the earth, and upon the sea, which are, and all things in them, heard I saying, To him sitting upon the throne, and to the Lamb, praise, and honour, and glory, and strength, for the times of times.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the four living creatures said, Amen. And the twenty-four elders fell and worshipped him living for the times of times.</verse>
