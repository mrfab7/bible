<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After the plague had ended, the LORD said to Moses and Eleazar son of Aaron the priest,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Take a census of the whole congregation of Israel by the houses of their fathers—all those twenty years of age or older who can serve in the army of Israel.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">So on the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho, Moses and Eleazar the priest issued the instruction,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">“Take a census of the men twenty years of age or older, as the LORD has commanded Moses.” And these were the Israelites who came out of the land of Egypt:</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them along with Korah, whose followers died when the fire consumed 250 men. They serve as a warning sign.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="54">Increase the inheritance for a large tribe and decrease it for a small one; each tribe is to receive its inheritance according to the number of those registered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">Indeed, the land must be divided by lot; they shall receive their inheritance according to the names of the tribes of their fathers.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="64">Among all these, however, there was not one who had been numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest when they counted the Israelites in the Wilderness of Sinai.</p>
