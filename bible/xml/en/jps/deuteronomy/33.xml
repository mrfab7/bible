  <verse number="1">And this is the blessing wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he said: The LORD came from Sinai, And rose from Seir unto them; He shined forth from mount Paran, And He came from the myriads holy, At His right hand was a fiery law unto them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Yea, He loveth the peoples, All His holy ones—they are in Thy hand; And they sit down at Thy feet, Receiving of Thy words.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Moses commanded us a law, An inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And there was a king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people were gathered, All the tribes of Israel together.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Let Reuben live, and not die In that his men become few.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And this for Judah, and he said: Hear, LORD, the voice of Judah, And bring him in unto his people; His hands shall contend for him, And Thou shalt be a help against his adversaries.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And of Levi he said: Thy Thummim and Thy Urim be with Thy holy one, Whom Thou didst prove at Massah, With whom Thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;</verse>
  <verse number="9">Who said of his father, and of his mother: ‘I have not seen him’; Neither did he acknowledge his brethren, Nor knew he his own children; For they have observed Thy word, And keep Thy covenant.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They shall teach Jacob Thine ordinances, And Israel Thy law; They shall put incense before Thee, And whole burnt-offering upon Thine altar.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Bless, LORD, his substance, And accept the work of his hands; Smite through the loins of them that rise up against him, And of them that hate him, that they rise not again.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Of Benjamin he said: The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by Him; He covereth him all the day, And He dwelleth between his shoulders.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And of Joseph he said: Blessed of the LORD be his land; For the precious things of heaven, for the dew, And for the deep that coucheth beneath,</verse>
  <verse number="14">And for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, And for the precious things of the yield of the moons,</verse>
  <verse number="15">And for the tops of the ancient mountains, And for the precious things of the everlasting hills,</verse>
  <verse number="16">And for the precious things of the earth and the fulness thereof, And the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush; Let the blessing come upon the head of Joseph, And upon the crown of the head of him that is prince among his brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="17">His firstling bullock, majesty is his; And his horns are the horns of the wild-ox; With them he shall gore the peoples all of them, even the ends of the earth; And they are the ten thousands of Ephraim, And they are the thousands of Manasseh.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And of Zebulun he said: Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out, And, Issachar, in thy tents.</verse>
  <verse number="19">They shall call peoples unto the mountain; There shall they offer sacrifices of righteousness; For they shall suck the abundance of the seas, And the hidden treasures of the sand.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And of Gad he said: Blessed be He that enlargeth Gad; He dwelleth as a lioness, And teareth the arm, yea, the crown of the head.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he chose a first part for himself, For there a portion of a ruler was reserved; And there came the heads of the people, He executed the righteousness of the LORD, And His ordinances with Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And of Dan he said: Dan is a lion’s whelp, That leapeth forth from Bashan.</verse>

  <verse number="25">Iron and brass shall be thy bars; And as thy days, so shall thy strength be.</verse>
  <verse number="26">There is none like unto God, O Jeshurun, Who rideth upon the heaven as thy help, And in His excellency on the skies.</verse>
  <verse number="27">The eternal God is a dwelling-place, And underneath are the everlasting arms; And He thrust out the enemy from before thee, And said: ‘Destroy.’</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Israel dwelleth in safety, The fountain of Jacob alone, In a land of corn and wine; Yea, his heavens drop down dew.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Happy art thou, O Israel, who is like unto thee? A people saved by the LORD, The shield of thy help, And that is the sword of thy excellency! And thine enemies shall dwindle away before thee; And thou shalt tread upon their high places.</verse>
