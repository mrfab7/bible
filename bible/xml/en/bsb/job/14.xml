<chapter book="Job" number="14" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">“Man, who is born of woman, is short of days and full of trouble.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Like a flower, he comes forth, then withers away; like a fleeting shadow, he does not endure.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Do You open Your eyes to one like this? Will You bring him into judgment before You?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who can bring out clean from unclean? No one!</verse>
  <verse number="5">Since his days are determined and the number of his months is with You, and since You have set limits that he cannot exceed,</verse>
  <verse number="6">look away from him and let him rest, so he can enjoy his day as a hired hand.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For there is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its tender shoots will not fail.</verse>
  <verse number="8">If its roots grow old in the ground and its stump dies in the soil,</verse>
  <verse number="9">at the scent of water it will bud and put forth twigs like a sapling.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But a man dies and is laid low; he breathes his last, and where is he?</verse>
  <verse number="11">As water disappears from the sea and a river becomes parched and dry,</verse>
  <verse number="12">so a man lies down and does not rise. Until the heavens are no more, he will not be awakened or roused from sleep.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If only You would hide me in Sheol and conceal me until Your anger has passed! If only You would appoint a time for me and then remember me!</verse>
  <verse number="14">When a man dies, will he live again? All the days of my hard service I will wait, until my renewal comes.</verse>
  <verse number="15">You will call, and I will answer; You will desire the work of Your hands.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For then You would count my steps, but would not keep track of my sin.</verse>
  <verse number="17">My transgression would be sealed in a bag, and You would cover over my iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But as a mountain erodes and crumbles and a rock is dislodged from its place,</verse>
  <verse number="19">as water wears away the stones and torrents wash away the soil, so You destroy a man’s hope.</verse>
  <verse number="20">You forever overpower him, and he passes on; You change his countenance and send him away.</verse>
  <verse number="21">If his sons receive honor, he does not know it; if they are brought low, he is unaware.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He feels only the pain of his own body and mourns only for himself.”</verse>
