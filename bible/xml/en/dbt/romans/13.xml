  <verse number="1">Let every soul be subject to the authorities that are above [him]. For there is no authority except from God; and those that exist are set up by God.</verse>
  <verse number="2">So that he that sets himself in opposition to the authority resists the ordinance of God; and they who [thus] resist shall bring sentence of guilt on themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For rulers are not a terror to a good work, but to an evil [one]. Dost thou desire then not to be afraid of the authority? practise [what is] good, and thou shalt have praise from it;</verse>
  <verse number="4">for it is God’s minister to thee for good. But if thou practisest evil, fear; for it bears not the sword in vain; for it is God’s minister, an avenger for wrath to him that does evil.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Wherefore it is necessary to be subject, not only on account of wrath, but also on account of conscience.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For on this account ye pay tribute also; for they are God’s officers, attending continually on this very thing.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Render to all their dues: to whom tribute [is due], tribute; to whom custom, custom; to whom fear, fear; to whom honour, honour.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Owe no one anything, unless to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not lust; and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this word, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Love works no ill to its neighbour; love therefore [is the] whole law.</verse>
  <verse number="11">This also, knowing the time, that it is already time that we should be aroused out of sleep; for now [is] our salvation nearer than when we believed.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The night is far spent, and the day is near; let us cast away therefore the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.</verse>
  <verse number="13">As in the day, let us walk becomingly; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and lasciviousness, not in strife and emulation.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not take forethought for the flesh to [fulfil its] lusts.</verse>
