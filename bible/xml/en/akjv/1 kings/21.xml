  <verse number="1">And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace of Ahab king of Samaria.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near to my house: and I will give you for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seem good to you, I will give you the worth of it in money.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I should give the inheritance of my fathers to you.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down on his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said to him, Why is your spirit so sad, that you eat no bread?</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite, and said to him, Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if it please you, I will give you another vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give you my vineyard.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Jezebel his wife said to him, Do you now govern the kingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let your heart be merry: I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.</verse>
  <verse number="8">So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name, and sealed them with his seal, and sent the letters to the elders and to the nobles that were in his city, dwelling with Naboth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people:</verse>
  <verse number="10">And set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, You did blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him, that he may die.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent to them, and as it was written in the letters which she had sent to them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat before him: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones, that he died.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and is dead.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned, and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="18">Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria: behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he is gone down to possess it.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus said the LORD, Have you killed, and also taken possession? And you shall speak to him, saying, Thus said the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your blood, even yours.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found you: because you have sold yourself to work evil in the sight of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Behold, I will bring evil on you, and will take away your posterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that urinates against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel,</verse>
  <verse number="22">And will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And of Jezebel also spoke the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Him that dies of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and him that dies in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But there was none like to Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth on his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="29">See you how Ahab humbles himself before me? because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: but in his son’s days will I bring the evil on his house.</verse>
