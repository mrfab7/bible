  <verse number="1">Then Job answered , and said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">How long do you afflict my soul, and break me in pieces with words?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Behold, these ten times you confound me, and are not ashamed to oppress me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For if I have been ignorant, my ignorance shall be with me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But you have set yourselves up against me, and reprove me with my reproaches.</verse>
  <verse number="6">At least now understand, that God hath not afflicted me with an equal judgment, and compassed me with his scourges.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Behold I cry suffering violence, and no one will hear: I shall cry aloud, and there is none to judge.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He hath hedged in my path round about, and I cannot pass, and in my way he hath set darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He hath stripped me of my glory, and hath taken the crown from my head.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am lost, and he hath taken away my hope, as from a tree that is plucked up.</verse>
  <verse number="11">His wrath is kindled against me, and he hath counted me as his enemy.</verse>
  <verse number="12">His troops have come together, and have made themselves a way by me, and have besieged my tabernacle round about.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He hath put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintance like strangers have departed from me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">My kinsmen have forsaken me, and they that knew me, have forgotten me.</verse>
  <verse number="15">They that dwelt in my house, and my maidservants have counted me a stranger, and I have been like an alien in their eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I called my servant, and he gave me no answer, I entreated him with my own mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">My wife hath abhorred my breath, and I entreated the children of my womb.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Even fools despise me; and when I gone from them, they spoke against me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">They that were sometime my counsellors, have abhorred me: and he whom I love most is turned against me.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The flesh being consumed. My bone hath cleaved to my skin, and nothing but lips are left about my teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Have pity on me, have pity on me, at least you my friends, because the hand of the Lord hath touched me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Why do you persecute me as God, and glut yourselves with my flesh?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Who will grant me that my words may be written? Who will grant me that they may be marked down in a book?</verse>
  <verse number="24">With an iron pen and in a plate of lead, or else be graven with an instrument in flint stone.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For I know that my Redeemer liveth, and in the last day I shall rise out of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And I shall be clothed again with my skin, and in my flesh I will see my God.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Whom I myself shall see, and my eyes shall behold, and not another: this my hope is laid up in my bosom.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Why then do you say now: Let us persecute him, and let us find occasion of word against him?</verse>
  <verse number="29">Flee then from the face of the sword, for the sword is the revenger of iniquities: and know ye that there is judgment.</verse>
