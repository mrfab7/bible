<chapter book="Job" number="7" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Is there not a warfare to man on earth? And as the days of an hireling his days?</verse>
  <verse number="2">As a servant desireth the shadow, And as a hireling expecteth his wage,</verse>
  <verse number="3">So I have been caused to inherit months of vanity, And nights of misery they numbered to me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">If I lay down then I said, ‘When do I rise!’ And evening hath been measured, And I have been full of tossings till dawn.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Clothed hath been my flesh with worms, And a clod of dust, My skin hath been shrivelled and is loathsome,</verse>
  <verse number="6">My days swifter than a weaving machine, And they are consumed without hope.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Remember Thou that my life is a breath, Mine eye turneth not back to see good.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The eye of my beholder beholdeth me not. Thine eyes are upon me—and I am not.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Consumed hath been a cloud, and it goeth, So he who is going down to Sheol cometh not up.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He turneth not again to his house, Nor doth his place discern him again.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Also I—I withhold not my mouth—I speak in the distress of my spirit, I talk in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
  <verse number="12">A sea -monster am I, or a dragon, That thou settest over me a guard?</verse>
  <verse number="13">When I said, ‘My bed doth comfort me,’ He taketh away in my talking my couch.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And thou hast affrighted me with dreams, And from visions thou terrifiest me,</verse>
  <verse number="15">And my soul chooseth strangling, Death rather than my bones.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I have wasted away—not to the age do I live. Cease from me, for my days are vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="17">What is man that Thou dost magnify him? And that Thou settest unto him Thy heart?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And inspectest him in the mornings, In the evenings dost try him?</verse>
  <verse number="19">How long dost Thou not look from me? Thou dost not desist till I swallow my spittle.</verse>
  <verse number="20">I have sinned, what do I to Thee, O watcher of man? Why hast Thou set me for a mark to Thee, And I am for a burden to myself—and what?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Thou dost not take away my transgression, And cause to pass away mine iniquity, Because now, for dust I lie down: And Thou hast sought me—and I am not!</verse>
