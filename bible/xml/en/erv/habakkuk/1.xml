  <verse number="1">The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.</verse>
  <verse number="2">O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear? I cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and look upon perverseness? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there is strife, and contention riseth up.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore judgment goeth forth perverted.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Behold ye among the nations, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I work a work in your days, which ye will not believe though it be told you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation; which march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling places that are not theirs.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves; and their horsemen spread themselves: yea, their horsemen come from far; they fly as an eagle that hasteth to devour.</verse>
  <verse number="9">They come all of them for violence; their faces are set eagerly as the east wind; and they gather captives as the sand.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Yea, he scoffeth at kings, and princes are a derision unto him: he derideth every strong hold; for he heapeth up dust, and taketh it.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then shall he sweep by as a wind, and shall pass over, and be guilty: even he whose might is his god.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Art not thou from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained him for judgment; and thou, O Rock, hast established him for correction.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Thou that art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and that canst not look on perverseness, wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy peace when the wicked swalloweth up the man that is more righteous than he;</verse>
  <verse number="14">and makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?</verse>
  <verse number="15">He taketh up all of them with the angle, he catcheth them in his net, and gathereth them in his drag: therefore he rejoiceth and is glad.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore he sacrificeth unto his net, and burneth incense unto his drag; because by them his portion is fat, and his meat plenteous.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Shall he therefore empty his net, and not spare to slay the nations continually?</verse>
