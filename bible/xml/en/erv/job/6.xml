<chapter book="Job" number="6" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Then Job answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Oh that my vexation were but weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!</verse>
  <verse number="3">For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas: therefore have my words been rash.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof my spirit drinketh up: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Can that which hath no savour be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</verse>
  <verse number="7">My soul refuseth to touch them; they are as loathsome meat to me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Even that it would please God to crush me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would exult in pain that spareth not: for I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</verse>
  <verse number="11">What is my strength, that I should wait? and what is mine end, at I should be patient?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Is it not that I have no help in me, and that effectual working is driven quite from me?</verse>
  <verse number="14">To him that is ready to faint kindness should be shewed from his friend; even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
  <verse number="15">My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, as the channel of brooks that pass away;</verse>
  <verse number="16">Which are black by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow hideth itself:</verse>
  <verse number="17">What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The caravans that travel by the way of them turn aside; they go up into the waste, and perish.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The caravans of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">They were ashamed because they had hoped; they came thither, and were confounded.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For now ye are nothing; ye see a terror, and are afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Did I say, Give unto me? or, offer a present for me of your substance?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Or, Deliver me from the adversary’s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Teach me, and I will hold my peace: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</verse>
  <verse number="25">How forcible are words of uprightness! but what doth your arguing reprove?</verse>
  <verse number="26">Do ye imagine to reprove words? seeing that the speeches of one that is desperate are as wind.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Yea, ye would cast lots upon the fatherless, and make merchandise of your friend.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Now therefore be pleased to look upon me; for surely I shall not lie to your face.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice; yea, return again, my cause is righteous.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Is there injustice on my tongue? cannot my taste discern mischievous things?</verse>
