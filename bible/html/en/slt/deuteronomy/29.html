<p class="verse" data-verse="1">These the words of the covenant which Jehovah commanded Moses to make with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Moses will call to all Israel and will say, to them, Ye saw all that Jehovah did before your eyes in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The great temptations which thine eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Jehovah gave not to you an heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, even to this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And I shall lead you forty years in the desert: your garments did not fall away from you, and thy shoe was not warn away from thy foot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Bread ye ate not, and wine and strong drink ye drank not; so that ye shall know that I am Jehovah your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And ye shall come to this place; and Sihon, king of Heshbon, will come, and Og, king of Bashan, to our meeting, to war; and we shall smite them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And we shall take their land and give it for an inheritance to the Reubenites and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of the Manassites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And watch ye the words of this covenant, and do them, so that ye shall be circumspect in all things which ye shall do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Ye stand this day all of you before Jehovah your God; your heads of your tribes, your old men, and your scribes, every man of Israel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Your little ones, your wives and thy stranger which is in the midst of thy camp, from him cutting thy woods to him drawing thy waters:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For thy passing into the covenant of Jehovah thy God, and into his oath, which Jehovah thy God made with thee this day:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">In order to set thee this day to him for a people, and he shall be to thee for God as he spake to thee, and as he sware to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaak, and to Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And not with you alone do I make this covenant and this oath;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But with those being here with us, standing before Jehovah our God, and with those not here with us this day:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">(For ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how we passed through in the midst of the nations which ye passed through;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And ye shall see their abominations and their rollings, wood and stone, silver and gold, which are with them:)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Lest there be among you man or woman, or family or tribe, whom his heart turn this day from Jehovah our God, to go to serve the gods of these nations; lest there be among you a root bearing poverty and wormwood;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And it was in his hearing the words of this oath, and he blessed himself in his heart, saying, Peace shall be to me, if in the hardness of my heart, I shall go to add satiating to thirst:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Jehovah shall not be willing to forgive him, for then the anger of Jehovah shall smoke, and his jealousy against that man, and every curse written in this book lay upon him, and Jehovah wiped out his name from under the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Jehovah separated him for evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant written in the book of this law:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And said, Another generation of your sons who shall rise up from after you, and the foreigner who shall come from a land afar off, and they saw the blows of that land, and the sicknesses which Jehovah made sick in it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Pitch and burning salt, all its land; it shall not be sown, and it shall not sprout, and no green herb shall come up upon it, as the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which Jehovah overthrew in his anger and in his wrath:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And all the nations said, For what did Jehovah thus to this land? what the heat of this great anger?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And they said, Because they left the covenant of Jehovah the God of their fathers, which he made with them; in his bringing them forth from the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And they will go and serve other gods, and will worship to them gods which they knew them not, and a portion not to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And the anger of Jehovah will kindle against this land, to bring upon it all the curses written in this book.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And Jehovah will tear them up from their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great anger, and will send them to another land as this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Hidden things to Jehovah our God: and uncovered things to us and to our sons to forever, to do all the words of this law.</p>
