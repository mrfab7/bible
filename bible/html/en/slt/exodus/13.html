<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Consecrate to me every first-born bursting open every womb among the sons of Israel, of man and of cattle: it is to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Moses will say to the people, Remember this day which ye came forth out of Egypt, out of the house of servants; for by strength of hand Jehovah brought you forth from here: and leavened shall not be eaten.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The day ye came forth in the month of Abib.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And it was when Jehovah shall bring thee forth to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he sware to thy fathers to give to thee, a land flowing with milk and honey; and do thou this service in this month.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened, and in the seventh day a festival to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Unleavened shall be eaten seven days: and leavened shall not be seen to thee in all thy bounds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And announce to thy son in this day, saying, For this Jehovah did to me in my coming out of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And it was to thee for a sign upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes; so that the law of Jehovah shall be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand Jehovah brought thee forth out of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And watch this law according to its appointment from days to days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And it was when Jehovah shall bring thee to the land of the Canaanites, as he sware to thee and to thy fathers, and he gave it to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And thou madest pass over all bursting open the womb, to Jehovah; and every one bursting forth young of the quadruped which shall be to thee; the males are to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And every first-born of the ass, thou shalt redeem with a sheep; and if thou shalt not redeem, thou shalt break his neck: and every first-born of man among thy sons thou shalt redeem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And it was when thy son shall ask thee to-morrow, saying, What this? and thou saidst to him, With strength of hand Jehovah brought us forth out of Egypt from the house of servants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And it shall be when Pharaoh was hard to send us forth, and Jehovah will kill every first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of man to the firstborn of cattle; for this I sacrifice to Jehovah all bursting forth the womb, the males; and all the first-born of my sons I will redeem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And it was for a sign upon thy hand, and for bands between thine eyes: for with a strong hand Jehovah brought us forth from Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And it shall be in Pharaohâ€™s sending forth the people, and God directed not the way of the land of the Philistines, for it is near; for God said, Lest the people shall grieve in their seeing war, and they turn back to Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And God will turn the people about the way of the desert, the sea of sedge: and the sons of Israel went up active out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Moses will take the bones of Joseph with him: for swearing he caused the sons of Israel to swear, saying, For reviewing, God will review you; and carry up my bones with you from here.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And they will remove from Succoth, and they will encamp in Etham, in the extremity of the desert.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Jehovah went before them the day in a pillar of cloud, to direct them the way; and the night in a pillar of fire to give light to them; to go the day and the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the pillar of cloud will not give way, the day, and the pillar of fire, the night, before the people.</p>
