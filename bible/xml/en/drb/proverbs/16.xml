  <verse number="16">Get wisdom, because it is better than gold: and purchase prudence, for it is more precious than silver.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The path of the just departeth from evils: he that keepeth his soul keepeth his way.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Pride goeth before destruction: and the spirit is lifted up before a fall.</verse>
  <verse number="19">It is better to be humbled with the meek, than to divide spoils with the proud.</verse>

  <verse number="32">The patient man is better than the valiant: and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh cities.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Lots are cast into the lap, but they are disposed of by the Lord.</verse>
