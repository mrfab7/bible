  <verse number="1">So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon [of wine].</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he appointed [certain] of the Levites to minister before the ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the LORD God of Israel:</verse>
  <verse number="5">Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;</verse>
  <verse number="6">Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then on that day David delivered first [this psalm] to thank the LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;</verse>
  <verse number="13">O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He [is] the LORD our God; his judgments [are] in all the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word [which] he commanded to a thousand generations;</verse>
  <verse number="16">[Even of the covenant] which he made with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;</verse>
  <verse number="17">And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, [and] to Israel [for] an everlasting covenant,</verse>
  <verse number="18">Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance;</verse>
  <verse number="19">When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And [when] they went from nation to nation, and from [one] kingdom to another people;</verse>
  <verse number="21">He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,</verse>
  <verse number="22">[Saying], Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day his salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works among all nations.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For great [is] the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also [is] to be feared above all gods.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For all the gods of the people [are] idols: but the LORD made the heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Glory and honour [are] in his presence; strength and gladness [are] in his place.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Give unto the LORD the glory [due] unto his name: bring an offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be stable, that it be not moved.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let [men] say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all that [is] therein.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="34">O give thanks unto the LORD; for [he is] good; for his mercy [endureth] for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, [and] glory in thy praise.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Blessed [be] the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="37">So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every day’s work required:</verse>
  <verse number="38">And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah [to be] porters:</verse>
  <verse number="39">And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that [was] at Gibeon,</verse>
  <verse number="40">To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the burnt offering continually morning and evening, and [to do] according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which he commanded Israel;</verse>
  <verse number="41">And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the LORD, because his mercy [endureth] for ever;</verse>
  <verse number="42">And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun [were] porters.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.</verse>
