<chapter book="1 Peter" number="3" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Likewise, you wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives;</verse>
  <verse number="2">While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;</verse>
  <verse number="4">But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:</verse>
  <verse number="6">Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, as long as you do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Likewise, you husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Finally, be you all of one mind, having compassion one of another, love as brothers, be pitiful, be courteous:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but contrariwise blessing; knowing that you are thereunto called, that you should inherit a blessing.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:</verse>
  <verse number="11">Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and ensue it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And who is he that will harm you, if you be followers of that which is good?</verse>
  <verse number="14">But and if you suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy are you: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;</verse>
  <verse number="15">But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear:</verse>
  <verse number="16">Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For it is better, if the will of God be so, that you suffer for well doing, than for evil doing.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</verse>
  <verse number="19">By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;</verse>
  <verse number="20">Which sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="22">Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels and authorities and powers being made subject to him.</verse>
