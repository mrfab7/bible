<p class="verse" data-verse="1">O that thou [wert] as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! [when] I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I would lead thee, [and] bring thee into my motherâ€™s house, [who] would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">His left hand [should be] under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake [my] love, until he please.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who [is] this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth [that] bare thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love [is] strong as death; jealousy [is] cruel as the grave: the coals thereof [are] coals of fire, [which hath] a most vehement flame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">If she [be] a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she [be] a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I [am] a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand [pieces] of silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">My vineyard, which [is] mine, [is] before me: thou, O Solomon, [must have] a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear [it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.</p>
