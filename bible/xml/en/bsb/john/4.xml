<chapter book="John" number="4" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">When Jesus realized that the Pharisees were aware He was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John</verse>
  <verse number="2">(although it was not Jesus who baptized, but His disciples),</verse>
  <verse number="3">He left Judea and returned to Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Now He had to pass through Samaria.</verse>
  <verse number="5">So He came to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Since Jacob’s well was there, Jesus, weary from His journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
  <verse number="7">When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, “Give Me a drink.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">(His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.)</verse>
  <verse number="9">“You are a Jew,” said the woman. “How can You ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)</verse>
  <verse number="10">Jesus answered, “If you knew the gift of God and who is asking you for a drink, you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.”</verse>
  <verse number="11">“Sir,” the woman replied, “You have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where then will You get this living water?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us this well and drank from it himself, as did his sons and his livestock?”</verse>
  <verse number="13">Jesus said to her, “Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But whoever drinks the water I give him will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give him will become in him a fount of water springing up to eternal life.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">The woman said to Him, “Sir, give me this water so that I will not get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water.”</verse>
  <verse number="16">Jesus told her, “Go, call your husband and come back.”</verse>
  <verse number="17">“I have no husband,” the woman replied. Jesus said to her, “You are correct to say that you have no husband.</verse>
  <verse number="18">In fact, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. You have spoken truthfully.”</verse>
  <verse number="19">“Sir,” the woman said, “I see that You are a prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you Jews say that the place where one must worship is in Jerusalem.”</verse>
  <verse number="21">“Believe Me, woman,” Jesus replied, “a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="22">You worship what you do not know; we worship what we do know, for salvation is from the Jews.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father is seeking such as these to worship Him.</verse>
  <verse number="24">God is Spirit, and His worshipers must worship Him in spirit and in truth.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">The woman said, “I know that Messiah” (called Christ) “is coming. When He comes, He will explain everything to us.”</verse>
  <verse number="26">Jesus answered, “I who speak to you am He.”</verse>
  <verse number="27">Just then His disciples returned and were surprised that He was speaking with a woman. But no one asked Him, “What do You want from her?” or “Why are You talking with her?”</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then the woman left her water jar, went back into the town, and said to the people,</verse>
  <verse number="29">“Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Christ?”</verse>
  <verse number="30">So they left the town and made their way toward Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Meanwhile the disciples urged Him, “Rabbi, eat something.”</verse>
  <verse number="32">But He told them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.”</verse>
  <verse number="33">So the disciples asked one another, “Could someone have brought Him food?”</verse>
  <verse number="34">Jesus explained, “My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Do you not say, ‘There are still four months until the harvest’? I tell you, lift up your eyes and look at the fields, for they are ripe for harvest.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Already the reaper draws his wages and gathers a crop for eternal life, so that the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For in this case the saying ‘One sows and another reaps’ is true.</verse>
  <verse number="38">I sent you to reap what you have not worked for; others have done the hard work, and now you have taken up their labor.”</verse>
  <verse number="39">Many of the Samaritans from that town believed in Jesus because of the woman’s testimony, “He told me everything I ever did.”</verse>
  <verse number="40">So when the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him to stay with them, and He stayed two days.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And many more believed because of His message.</verse>
  <verse number="42">They said to the woman, “We now believe not only because of your words; we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man truly is the Savior of the world.”</verse>
  <verse number="43">After two days, Jesus left for Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Now He Himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own hometown.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Yet when He arrived, the Galileans welcomed Him. They had seen all the great things He had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they had gone there as well.</verse>
  <verse number="46">So once again He came to Cana in Galilee, where He had turned the water into wine. And there was a royal official whose son lay sick at Capernaum.</verse>
  <verse number="47">When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged Him to come down and heal his son, who was about to die.</verse>
  <verse number="48">Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.”</verse>
  <verse number="49">“Sir,” the official said, “come down before my child dies.”</verse>
  <verse number="50">“Go,” said Jesus. “Your son will live.” The man took Jesus at His word and departed.</verse>
  <verse number="51">And while he was still on the way, his servants met him with the news that his boy was alive.</verse>
  <verse number="52">So he inquired as to the hour when his son had recovered, and they told him, “The fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour.”</verse>
  <verse number="53">Then the father realized that this was the very hour in which Jesus had told him, “Your son will live.” And he and all his household believed.</verse>
  <verse number="54">This was now the second sign that Jesus performed after coming from Judea into Galilee.</verse>
