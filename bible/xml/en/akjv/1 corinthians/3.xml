<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="3" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And I, brothers, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, even as to babes in Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for till now you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For you are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are you not carnal, and walk as men?</verse>
  <verse number="4">For while one said, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are you not carnal?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</verse>
  <verse number="6">I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</verse>
  <verse number="7">So then neither is he that plants any thing, neither he that waters; but God that gives the increase.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now he that plants and he that waters are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For we are laborers together with God: you are God’s husbandry, you are God’s building.</verse>
  <verse number="10">According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds thereon. But let every man take heed how he builds thereupon.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now if any man build on this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</verse>
  <verse number="13">Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.</verse>
  <verse number="14">If any man’s work abide which he has built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</verse>
  <verse number="15">If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?</verse>
  <verse number="17">If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And again, The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;</verse>
  <verse number="22">Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</verse>
  <verse number="23">And you are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.</verse>
