  <verse number="1">Now when these things were done, the word of the Lord came to Abram by a vision, saying: Fear not, Abram, I am thy protector, and thy reward exceeding great.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Abram said: Lord God, what wilt thou give me? I shall go without children: and the son of the steward of my house is this Damascus Eliezer.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Abram added: But to me thou hast not given seed: and lo my servant, born in my house, shall be my heir.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And immediately the word of the Lord came to him, saying: He shall not be thy heir: but he that shall come out of thy bowels, him shalt thou have for thy heir.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he thought him forth abroad, and said to him: Look up to heaven and number the stars, if thou canst. And he said to him: So shall thy seed be.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Abram believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he said to him: I am the Lord who brought thee out from Ur of the Chaldees, to gibe thee this land, and that thou mightest possess it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But he said: Lord God, whereby may I know that I shall possess it?</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the Lord answered, and said: Take me a cow of three years old, and a she goat of three years, and a ram of three years, a turtle also, and a pigeon.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And he took all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid the two pieces of each one against the other; but the birds he divided not.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the fowls came down upon carcasses, and Abram drove them away.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And when the sun was setting, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a great and darksome horror seized upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And it was said unto him: Know thou beforehand that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land not their own, and they shall bring them under bondage, and afflict them four hundred years.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But I will judge the nation which they shall serve, and after this they shall come out with great substance.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace, and be buried in a good old age.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But in the fourth generation they shall return hither: for as yet the iniquities of the Amorrhites are not at the full until this present time.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And when the sun was set, there arose a dark mist, and there appeared a smoking furnace and a lamp of fire passing between those divisions.</verse>
  <verse number="18">That day God made a covenant with Abram, saying: To thy seed will I give this land, from the river of Egypt even to the great river Euphrates.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The Cineans and Cenezites, the Cedmonites,</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the Hethites, and the Pherezites, the Raphaim also,</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the Amorrhites, and the Chanaanits, and the Gergesites, and the Jebusites.</verse>
