<chapter book="Jeremiah" number="30" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thus speaks the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write you all the words that I have spoken to you in a book.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For, see, the days come, said the LORD, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, said the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And these are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For thus said the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Ask you now, and see whether a man does travail with child? why do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble, but he shall be saved out of it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For it shall come to pass in that day, said the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off your neck, and will burst your bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:</verse>
  <verse number="9">But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore fear you not, O my servant Jacob, said the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, see, I will save you from afar, and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make him afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For I am with you, said the LORD, to save you: though I make a full end of all nations where I have scattered you, yet I will not make a full end of you: but I will correct you in measure, and will not leave you altogether unpunished.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For thus said the LORD, Your bruise is incurable, and your wound is grievous.</verse>
  <verse number="13">There is none to plead your cause, that you may be bound up: you have no healing medicines.</verse>
  <verse number="14">All your lovers have forgotten you; they seek you not; for I have wounded you with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of your iniquity; because your sins were increased.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Why cry you for your affliction? your sorrow is incurable for the multitude of your iniquity: because your sins were increased, I have done these things to you.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore all they that devour you shall be devoured; and all your adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and they that spoil you shall be a spoil, and all that prey on you will I give for a prey.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds, said the LORD; because they called you an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeks after.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Thus said the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob’s tents, and have mercy on his dwelling places; and the city shall be built on her own heap, and the palace shall remain after the manner thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Their children also shall be as aforetime, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And their nobles shall be of themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the middle of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach to me: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach to me? said the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And you shall be my people, and I will be your God.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goes forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain on the head of the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he has done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days you shall consider it.</verse>
