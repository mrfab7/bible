  <verse number="1">Thus said Jehovah, Watch ye judgment and do justice; for my salvation drew near to come, and my justice to be uncovered.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Happy the man that shall do this, and the son of man that shall lay hold upon it; watching the Sabbath from defiling it, and watching his hand from doing all evil.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the son of the stranger joining himself to Jehovah, shall not say, saying, Jehovah separating, will separate me from his people; and the eunuch shall not say, Behold me a dry tree.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For thus said Jehovah to the eunuchs who shall watch my Sabbaths, and choose in what I delighted, and taking hold upon my covenant;</verse>
  <verse number="5">And I gave to them in my house and in my walls a hand and a name good above sons and above daughters: an eternal name will I give to him which shall not be cut off.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the sons of the stranger joining themselves to Jehovah to serve him, and to love the name of Jehovah, to be to him for servants, every one watching the Sabbath from defiling it, and taking hold upon my covenant;</verse>
  <verse number="7">And I brought them to my holy mountain, and I made them rejoice in the house of my prayer: their burnt-offerings and their sacrifices for acceptance upon mine altar; for my house shall be called the house of prayer for all the peoples.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Says the Lord Jehovah gathering the outcasts of Israel, Yet will I gather to him to his gathered.</verse>
  <verse number="9">All ye beasts of the fields, come ye to eat; all ye beasts in the forest.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Look about, ye blind; they all knew not, they all dumb dogs, they shall not be able to bark; dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And dogs hard of soul, they knew not fulness; and they are evil, they know not understanding; they all looked to their way, a man to his plunder from his extremity.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Come ye, I will take wine, and we will drink strong drink to excess; and the morrow being as this day, the remainder great exceedingly.</verse>
