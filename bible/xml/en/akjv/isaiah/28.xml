<chapter book="Isaiah" number="28" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!</verse>
  <verse number="2">Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under feet:</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer; which when he that looks on it sees, while it is yet in his hand he eats it up.</verse>
  <verse number="5">In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, to the residue of his people,</verse>
  <verse number="6">And for a spirit of judgment to him that sits in judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from the breasts.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For precept must be on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, and there a little:</verse>
  <verse number="11">For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people.</verse>
  <verse number="12">To whom he said, This is the rest with which you may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But the word of the LORD was to them precept on precept, precept on precept; line on line, line on line; here a little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Why hear the word of the LORD, you scornful men, that rule this people which is in Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Because you have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing whip shall pass through, it shall not come to us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing whip shall pass through, then you shall be trodden down by it.</verse>
  <verse number="19">From the time that it goes forth it shall take you: for morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Now therefore be you not mockers, lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even determined on the whole earth.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Give you ear, and hear my voice; listen, and hear my speech.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Does the plowman plow all day to sow? does he open and break the clods of his ground?</verse>
  <verse number="25">When he has made plain the face thereof, does he not cast abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rye in their place?</verse>
  <verse number="26">For his God does instruct him to discretion, and does teach him.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about on the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his horsemen.</verse>
  <verse number="29">This also comes forth from the LORD of hosts, which is wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.</verse>
