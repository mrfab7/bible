<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="7" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Is there not an appointed time to man on earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As a servant earnestly desires the shadow, and as an hireling looks for the reward of his work:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro to the dawning of the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">My days are swifter than a weaverâ€™s shuttle, and are spent without hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">O remember that my life is wind: my eye shall no more see good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The eye of him that has seen me shall see me no more: your eyes are on me, and I am not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away: so he that goes down to the grave shall come up no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Am I a sea, or a whale, that you set a watch over me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaints;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then you scare me with dreams, and terrify me through visions:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">So that my soul chooses strangling, and death rather than my life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I loathe it; I would not live always: let me alone; for my days are vanity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">What is man, that you should magnify him? and that you should set your heart on him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And that you should visit him every morning, and try him every moment?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">How long will you not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I have sinned; what shall I do to you, O you preserver of men? why have you set me as a mark against you, so that I am a burden to myself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And why do you not pardon my transgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and you shall seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.</p>
