  <verse number="1">Lo, mine eye hath seen all [this], mine ear hath heard and understood it.</verse>
  <verse number="2">What ye know, [the same] do I know also: I [am] not inferior unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But ye [are] forgers of lies, ye [are] all physicians of no value.</verse>
  <verse number="5">O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye [so] mock him?</verse>
  <verse number="10">He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Your remembrances [are] like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what [will].</verse>
  <verse number="14">Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">He also [shall be] my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Behold now, I have ordered [my] cause; I know that I shall be justified.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Who [is] he [that] will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Only do not two [things] unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.</verse>
  <verse number="23">How many [are] mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?</verse>
  <verse number="25">Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?</verse>
  <verse number="26">For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.</verse>
