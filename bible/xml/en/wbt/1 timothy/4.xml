  <verse number="1">Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons;</verse>
  <verse number="2">Speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</verse>
  <verse number="3">Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by them who believe and know the truth.</verse>

  <verse number="5">For it is sanctified by the word of God, and prayer.</verse>

  <verse number="7">But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself rather to godliness.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</verse>
  <verse number="9">This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation.</verse>

  <verse number="14">Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Take heed to thyself and to thy doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou wilt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.</verse>
