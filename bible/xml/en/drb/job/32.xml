<chapter book="Job" number="32" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he seemed just to himself.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram, was angry and was moved to indignation : now he was angry against Job, because he said he was just before God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he was angry with his friends because they had not found a reasonable answer, but only had condemned Job.</verse>
  <verse number="4">So Eliu waited while Job was speaking, because they were his elders that were speaking.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But when he saw that the three were not able to answer, he was exceedingly angry.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said : I am younger in days, and you are more ancient; therefore hanging down my head, I was afraid to shew you my opinion.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For I hoped that greater age would speak, and that a multitude of years would teach wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But, as I see, there is a spirit in men, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="9">They that are aged are not the wise men, neither do the ancients understand judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore I will speak : Hearken to me, I also will shew you my wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For I have waited for your words, I have given ear to your wisdom, as long as you were disputing in words.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And as long as I thought you said some thing, I considered : but, as I see, there is none of you that can convince Job, and answer his words.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Lest you should say : We have found wisdom, God hath cast him down, not man.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He hath spoken nothing to me, and I will not answer him according to your words.</verse>
  <verse number="15">They were afraid, and answered no more, and they left off speaking.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore because I have waited, and they have not spoken : they stood, and answered no more :</verse>
  <verse number="17">I also will answer my part, and will shew my knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="18"></verse>
  <verse number="19">Behold, my belly is as new wine which wanteth vent, which bursteth the new vessels.</verse>
  <verse number="20">I will speak and take breath a little : I will open my lips, and will answer.</verse>
  <verse number="21">I will not accept the person of man, and I will not level God with man.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For I know not how long I shall continue, and whether after a while my Maker may take me away.</verse>
