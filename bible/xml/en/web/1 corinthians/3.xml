<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="3" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Brothers, I couldn’t speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly, as to babies in Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I fed you with milk, not with meat; for you weren’t yet ready. Indeed, not even now are you ready,</verse>
  <verse number="3">for you are still fleshly. For insofar as there is jealousy, strife, and factions among you, aren’t you fleshly, and don’t you walk in the ways of men?</verse>
  <verse number="4">For when one says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” aren’t you fleshly?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Who then is Apollos, and who is Paul, but servants through whom you believed; and each as the Lord gave to him?</verse>
  <verse number="6">I planted. Apollos watered. But God gave the increase.</verse>
  <verse number="7">So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now he who plants and he who waters are the same, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For we are God’s fellow workers. You are God’s farming, God’s building.</verse>
  <verse number="10">According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I laid a foundation, and another builds on it. But let each man be careful how he builds on it.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For no one can lay any other foundation than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, or stubble;</verse>
  <verse number="13">each man’s work will be revealed. For the Day will declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself will test what sort of work each man’s work is.</verse>
  <verse number="14">If any man’s work remains which he built on it, he will receive a reward.</verse>
  <verse number="15">If any man’s work is burned, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, but as through fire.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Don’t you know that you are a temple of God, and that God’s Spirit lives in you?</verse>
  <verse number="17">If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, which you are.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Let no one deceive himself. If anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, “He has taken the wise in their craftiness.”</verse>
  <verse number="20">And again, “The Lord knows the reasoning of the wise, that it is worthless.”</verse>
  <verse number="21">Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,</verse>
  <verse number="22">whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come. All are yours,</verse>
  <verse number="23">and you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s.</verse>
