<p class="verse" data-verse="1">We then, [as] workers together [with him], beseech [you] also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">(For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now [is] the accepted time; behold, now [is] the day of salvation.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But in all [things] approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and [yet] true;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">As unknown, and [yet] well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and [yet] possessing all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">O [ye] Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto [my] children,) be ye also enlarged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in [them]; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean [thing]; and I will receive you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</p>
