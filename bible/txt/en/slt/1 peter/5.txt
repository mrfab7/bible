1	The elders among you I beseech, a fellow elder, and witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a participator of the glory which is about to be revealed:
2	Tend the flock of God which among you, inspecting, not by force, but voluntarily; neither occupied in sordid gain, but of a ready will;
3	Neither as ruling over the portions obtained by lot, but being types of the flock.
4	And the chief Shepherd having been manifested, ye shall be attired with an unfading crown of glory.
5	Likewise, ye younger, be subjected to the elders. And all being subject to one another, be wrapped up in humility: for God opposes the proud, and gives grace to the humble.
6	Therefore be humbled under the strong hand of God, that he might lift you up) in due measure:
7	Having cast all your care upon him; for to him is the care for you.
8	Be abstemious, watch; for your adversary the accuser, as a roaring lion, walks around, seeking whom he might swallow down:
9	Whom resist firm in the faith, knowing that the same of sufferings are completed by your brotherhood in the world.
10	And the God of all grace, having called us to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, may he put you in proper order, having suffered a little time, may he support you, make firm, lay the foundation.
11	To him the glory and the strength for the time of times. Amen.
12	By Silvanus, to you the faithful brother, as I reckon, I wrote briefly, beseeching, and bearing testimony this to be the true grace of God in which ye stand.
13	The chosen together in Babylon, greet you; also Marcus my son.
14	Greet one another in a kiss of love. Peace to all you which in Christ Jesus. Amen.
