<p class="verse" data-verse="1">One who scatters advances against you, O Nineveh. Guard the fortress! Watch the road! Brace yourselves! Summon all your strength!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For the LORD will restore the splendor of Jacob like the splendor of Israel, though destroyers have laid them waste and ruined the branches of their vine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The shields of his mighty men are red; the valiant warriors are dressed in scarlet. The fittings of the chariots flash like fire on the day they are prepared, and the spears of cypress have been brandished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The chariots dash through the streets; they rush around the plazas, appearing like torches, darting about like lightning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He summons his nobles; they stumble as they advance. They race to its wall; the protective shield is set in place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The river gates are thrown open and the palace collapses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">It is decreed that the city be exiled and carried away; her maidservants moan like doves, and beat upon their breasts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Nineveh has been like a pool of water throughout her days, but now it is draining away. “Stop! Stop!” they cry, but no one turns back.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">“Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold!” There is no end to the treasure, an abundance of every precious thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">She is emptied! Yes, she is desolate and laid waste! Hearts melt, knees knock, bodies tremble, and every face grows pale!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Where is the lions’ lair or the feeding ground of the young lions, where the lion and lioness prowled with their cubs, with nothing to frighten them away?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The lion mauled enough for its cubs and strangled prey for the lioness. It filled its dens with the kill, and its lairs with mauled prey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">“Behold, I am against you,” declares the LORD of Hosts. “I will reduce your chariots to cinders, and the sword will devour your young lions. I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voices of your messengers will no longer be heard.”</p>
