<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Timothy" data-chapter="4" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now the Spirit has clearly said that, in the end times, some persons will depart from the faith, paying attention to spirits of error and the doctrines of devils,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">speaking lies in hypocrisy, and having their consciences seared,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">prohibiting marriage, abstaining from foods, which God has created to be accepted with thanksgiving by the faithful and by those who have understood the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected which is received with thanksgiving;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">for it has been sanctified by the Word of God and by prayer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">By proposing these things to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished by words of faith, and by the good doctrine that you have secured.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But avoid the silly fables of old women. And exercise yourself so as to advance in piety.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For the exercise of the body is somewhat useful. But piety is useful in all things, holding the promise of life, in the present and in the future.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">This is a faithful saying and worthy of full acceptance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For this reason we labor and are maligned: because we hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, most especially of the faithful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Instruct and teach these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let no one despise your youth, but be an example among the faithful in word, in behavior, in charity, in faith, in chastity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Until I arrive, attend to reading, to exhortation, and to doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Do not be willing to neglect the grace that is within you, which was given to you through prophecy, with the imposition of the hands of the priesthood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Meditate on these things, so that your progress may be manifest to all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Pay attention to yourself and to doctrine. Pursue these things. For in doing so, you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.</p>
