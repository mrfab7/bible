<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="19" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Better is the poor who walks in his simplicity, than the rich who twists his lips and is unwise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Where there is no knowledge of the soul, there is no good. And whoever hurries with his feet will stumble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The foolishness of a man undermines his steps. And then he seethes in his soul against God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Riches adds many friends. But from the pauper, even those whom he had become separated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A false witness shall not go unpunished. And whoever speaks lies will not escape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Many honor the character of one who is powerful, and there are friends for a giver of gifts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The brothers of the poor man hate him. Moreover, even his friends have withdrawn far from him. Whoever pursues only words shall have nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But whoever possesses reason loves his own soul. And one who guards prudence shall discover good things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A false witness shall not go unpunished. And whoever speaks lies will perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Fine things are not fitting for the foolish, nor is it fitting for a servant to rule over princes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The doctrine of a man is known through patience. And his glory is to pass beyond iniquities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Like the roaring of a lion, so also is the wrath of a king. And his cheerfulness is like the dew upon the grass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A foolish son is the grief of his father. And an argumentative wife is like a roof that is continually leaking.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">A house and its riches are given by parents. But a prudent wife is particularly from the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Laziness sends one into a deep sleep, and a dissolute soul will go hungry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Whoever guards a commandment guards his own soul. But whoever neglects his own way will die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Whoever is merciful to the poor lends to the Lord. And he will repay him for his efforts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Teach your son; do not despair. But do not set your soul toward putting him to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Whoever is impatient will sustain damage. And when it has been taken away, he will set up another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Listen to counsel and take up discipline, so that you may be wise in your latter days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">There are many intentions in the heart of a man. But the will of the Lord shall stand firm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">An indigent man is merciful. And a pauper is better than a deceitful man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The fear of the Lord is unto life. And he shall linger in plentitude, without being visited by disaster.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The lazy conceals his hand under his arm, and he will not so much as bring it to his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">When the pestilent are scourged, the foolish will become wiser. But if you chastise the wise, he will understand discipline.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Whoever afflicts his father and flees from his mother is disreputable and unhappy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Son, do not cease listening to doctrine, and do not be ignorant of the sermons of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">An unjust witness ridicules judgment. And the mouth of the impious devours iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Judgments are prepared for those who ridicule. And striking hammers are prepared for the bodies of the foolish.</p>
