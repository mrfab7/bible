<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="5" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, pay attention to my wisdom, and incline your ear to my prudence,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">so that you may guard your thinking, and so that your lips may preserve discipline. Do not pay attention to the deceit of a woman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the lips of a loose woman are like a dripping honeycomb, and her voice is smoother than oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But in the end, she is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a two-edged sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Her feet descend into death, and her steps reach even to Hell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">They do not walk along the path of life; her steps are wandering and untraceable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Therefore, my son, listen to me now, and do not withdraw from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Make your way at a distance from her, and do not approach the doors of her house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Do not give your honor to foreigners, and your years to the cruel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Otherwise, outsiders may be filled with your strength, and your labors may be in a foreign house,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and you may mourn in the end, when you will have consumed your flesh and your body. And so you may say:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">“Why have I detested discipline, and why has my heart not been quieted by correction?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And why have I not listened to the voice of those who guided me? And why has my ear not inclined to my teachers?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I have almost been with all evil in the midst of the church and of the assembly.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Drink water from your own cistern and from the springs of your own well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let your fountains be diverted far and wide, and divide your waters in the streets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Hold them for yourself alone, and do not let strangers be partakers with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Let your spring be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of your youth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">a beloved doe and most pleasing fawn. Let her breasts inebriate you at all times. Be delighted continually by her love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Why are you seduced, my son, by a strange woman, and why are you kept warm by the bosom of another?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The Lord beholds the ways of man, and he considers all his steps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">His own iniquities take hold of the impious, and he is bound by the cords of his own sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He shall die, for he has not held to discipline. And by the multitude of his foolishness, he shall be deceived.</p>
