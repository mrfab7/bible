  <verse number="1">And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a man of Adullam whose name was Hirah.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Judah saw there the daughter of a Canaanitish man whose name was Shua; and he took her, and went in to her.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And she conceived and bore a son; and he called his name Er.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And she again conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And again she bore a son, and she called his name Shelah; and he was at Chezib when she bore him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of Jehovah, and Jehovah slew him.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then Judah said to Onan, Go in to thy brother’s wife, and fulfil to her the brother-in-law’s duty, and raise up seed to thy brother.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But when Onan knew that the seed should not be his own, it came to pass when he went in to his brother’s wife, that he spilled [it] on the ground, in order to give no seed to his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the thing which he did was evil in the sight of Jehovah, and he slew him also.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow in thy father’s house, until Shelah my son is grown; for he said, Lest he die also, as his brethren. And Tamar went and remained in her father’s house.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And as the days were multiplied, Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua, died. And Judah was comforted, and he went up to his sheep-shearers, to Timnah, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And she put the garments of her widowhood off from her, and covered herself with a veil, and wrapped herself, and sat in the entry of Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given to him as wife.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Judah saw her, and took her for a harlot; because she had covered her face.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he turned aside to her by the way, and said, Come, I pray thee, let me go in to thee; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in to me?</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he said, I will send [thee] a kid of the goats from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give [me] a pledge, until thou send it?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet, and thy lace, and thy staff which is in thy hand. And he gave [it] her, and went in to her; and she conceived by him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And she arose and went away; and she laid by her veil from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman’s hand; but he found her not.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he asked the men of her place, saying, Where is the prostitute that was at Enaim, by the way-side? And they said, There was no prostitute here.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he returned to Judah, and said, I have not found her; and also the men of the place said, No prostitute has been here.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Then Judah said, Let her take [it] for herself, lest we be put to shame. Behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter-in-law has committed fornication, and behold, she is also with child by fornication. And Judah said, Bring her forth, that she may be burned.</verse>
  <verse number="25">When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man to whom these [belong] am I with child; and she said, Acknowledge, I pray thee, whose are this signet, and this lace, and this staff.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And Judah acknowledged [them], and said, She is more righteous than I, because I have not given her to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And it came to pass at the time of her delivery, that behold, twins were in her womb.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And it came to pass when she brought forth, that one stretched out [his] hand, and the midwife took it and bound round his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And it came to pass as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother came out; and she said, How hast thou broken forth! on thee be the breach! And they called his name Pherez.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And afterwards came out his brother, round whose hand was the scarlet thread; and they called his name Zerah.</verse>
