  <verse number="1">This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</verse>
  <verse number="3">Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</verse>
  <verse number="5">Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</verse>
  <verse number="7">Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all [men], as theirs also was.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,</verse>
  <verse number="11">Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of [them] all the Lord delivered me.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned [them];</verse>
  <verse number="15">And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="16">All scripture [is] given by inspiration of God, and [is] profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</verse>
  <verse number="17">That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</verse>
