<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelled! add you year to year; let them kill sacrifices.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow: and it shall be to me as Ariel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I will camp against you round about, and will lay siege against you with a mount, and I will raise forts against you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And you shall be brought down, and shall speak out of the ground, and your speech shall be low out of the dust, and your voice shall be, as of one that has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech shall whisper out of the dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Moreover the multitude of your strangers shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff that passes away: yes, it shall be at an instant suddenly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">You shall be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her fortification, and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">It shall even be as when an hungry man dreams, and, behold, he eats; but he wakes, and his soul is empty: or as when a thirsty man dreams, and, behold, he drinks; but he wakes, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul has appetite: so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight against mount Zion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry you out, and cry: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For the LORD has poured out on you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes: the prophets and your rulers, the seers has he covered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the vision of all is become to you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned, saying, Read this, I pray you: and he said, I cannot; for it is sealed:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray you: and he said, I am not learned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Why the Lord said, For as much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honor me, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Woe to them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who sees us? and who knows us?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as the potterâ€™s clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that framed it, He had no understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For the terrible one is brought to nothing, and the scorner is consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for him that reproves in the gate, and turn aside the just for a thing of nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Therefore thus said the LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall his face now wax pale.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the middle of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.</p>
