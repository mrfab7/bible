  <verse number="1">And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</verse>
  <verse number="2">and Jesus also was bidden, and his disciples, to the marriage.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And when the wine failed, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</verse>
  <verse number="5">His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the Jews’ manner of purifying, containing two or three firkins apiece.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the ruler of the feast. And they bare it.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and knew not whence it was (but the servants which had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast calleth the bridegroom,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and saith unto him, Every man setteth on first the good wine; and when men have drunk freely, then that which is worse: thou hast kept the good wine until now.</verse>
  <verse number="11">This beginning of his signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and there they abode not many days.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</verse>
  <verse number="15">and he made a scourge of cords, and cast all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew their tables;</verse>
  <verse number="16">and to them that sold the doves he said, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house a house of merchandise.</verse>
  <verse number="17">His disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house shall eat me up.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The Jews therefore answered and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?</verse>
  <verse number="21">But he spake of the temple of his body.</verse>
  <verse number="22">When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he spake this; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he did.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But Jesus did not trust himself unto them, for that he knew all men,</verse>
  <verse number="25">and because he needed not that any one should bear witness concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.</verse>
