<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Brothers, if someone is caught in a trespass, you who are spiritual should restore him with a spirit of gentleness. But watch yourself, or you also may be tempted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Carry one anotherâ€™s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Each one should test his own work. Then he will have reason to boast in himself alone, and not in someone else.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For each one should carry his own load.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Nevertheless, the one who receives instruction in the word must share in all good things with his instructor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Do not be deceived: God is not to be mocked. Whatever a man sows, he will reap in return.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The one who sows to please his flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; but the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Let us not grow weary in well-doing, for in due time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to the family of faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">See what large letters I am using to write to you with my own hand!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised. They only do this to avoid persecution for the cross of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For the circumcised do not even keep the law themselves, yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But as for me, may I never boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything. What counts is a new creation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Peace and mercy to all who walk by this rule, even to the Israel of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.</p>
