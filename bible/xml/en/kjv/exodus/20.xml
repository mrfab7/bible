  <verse number="2">I [am] the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness [of any thing] that [is] in heaven above, or that [is] in the earth beneath, or that [is] in the water under the earth:</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God [am] a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth [generation] of them that hate me;</verse>
  <verse number="6">And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:</verse>
  <verse number="10">But the seventh day [is] the sabbath of the LORD thy God: [in it] thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that [is] within thy gates:</verse>
  <verse number="11">For [in] six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them [is], and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Thou shalt not kill.</verse>

  <verse number="15">Thou shalt not steal.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that [is] thy neighbour’s.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw [it], they removed, and stood afar off.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear: but let not God speak with us, lest we die.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Moses said unto the people, Fear not: for God is come to prove you, and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God [was].</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the LORD said unto Moses, Thus thou shalt say unto the children of Israel, Ye have seen that I have talked with you from heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.</verse>
  <verse number="24">An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings, and thy peace offerings, thy sheep, and thine oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone: for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto mine altar, that thy nakedness be not discovered thereon.</verse>
