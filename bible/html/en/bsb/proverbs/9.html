<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="9" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wisdom has built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">She has prepared her meat and mixed her wine; she has also set her table.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">She has sent out her maidservants; she calls out from the heights of the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” she says to him who lacks judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">“Come, eat my bread and drink the wine I have mixed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Leave your folly behind, and you will live; walk in the way of understanding.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He who corrects a mocker brings shame on himself; he who rebukes a wicked man taints himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Do not rebuke a mocker, or he will hate you; rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Instruct a wise man, and he will be wiser still; teach a righteous man, and he will increase his learning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For through wisdom your days will be multiplied, and years will be added to your life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If you are wise, you are wise to your own advantage; but if you scoff, you alone will bear the consequences.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The woman named Folly is loud; she is naive and knows nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">She sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the heights of the city,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">calling out to those who pass by, who make their paths straight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">“Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!” she says to him who lacks judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">“Stolen water is sweet, and bread eaten in secret is tasty!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But they do not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.</p>
