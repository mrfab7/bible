  <verse number="1">AMEN, amen I say to you: He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up another way, the same is a thief and a robber.</verse>
  <verse number="2">But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="3">To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And when he hath let out his own sheep, he goeth before them: and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But a stranger they follow not, but fly from him, because they know not the voice of strangers.</verse>
  <verse number="6">This proverb Jesus spoke to them. But they understood not what he spoke to them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Jesus therefore said to them again: Amen, amen I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="8">All others, as many as have come, are thieves and robbers: and the sheep heard them not.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I am the door. By me, if any man enter in, he shall be saved: and he shall go in, and go out, and shall find pastures.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I am come that they may have life, and may have it more abundantly.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd giveth his life for his sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But the hireling, and he that is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and flieth: and the wolf catcheth, and scattereth the sheep:</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the hireling flieth, because he is a hireling: and he hath no care for the sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I am the good shepherd; and I know mine, and mine know me.</verse>
  <verse number="15">As the Father knoweth me, and I know the Father: and I lay down my life for my sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And other sheep I have, that are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold and one shepherd.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Therefore doth the Father love me: because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.</verse>
  <verse number="18">No man taketh it away from me: but I lay it down of myself, and I have power to lay it down: and I have power to take it up again. This commandment have I received of my Father.</verse>
  <verse number="19">A dissension rose again among the Jews for these words.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And many of them said: He hath a devil, and is mad: why hear you him?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Others said: These are not the words of one that hath a devil: Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</verse>
  <verse number="22">And it was the feast of the dedication at Jerusalem: and it was winter.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Jesus walked in the temple, in Solomon’s porch.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The Jews therefore came round about him, and said to him: How long dost thou hold our souls in suspense? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Jesus answered them: I speak to you, and you believe not: the works that I do in the name of my Father, they give testimony of me.</verse>
  <verse number="26">But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="27">My sheep hear my voice: and I know them, and they follow me.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And I give them life everlasting; and they shall not perish for ever, and no man shall pluck them out of my hand.</verse>
  <verse number="29">That which my Father hath given me, is greater than all: and no one can snatch them out of the hand of my Father.</verse>
  <verse number="30">I and the Father are one.</verse>
  <verse number="31">The Jews then took up stones to stone him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Jesus answered them: Many good works I have shewed you from my Father; for which of these works do you stone me?</verse>
  <verse number="33">The Jews answered him: For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, maketh thyself God.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your law: I said you are gods?</verse>
  <verse number="35">If he called them gods, to whom to word of God was spoken, and the scripture cannot be broken;</verse>
  <verse number="36">Do you say of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world: Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?</verse>
  <verse number="37">If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</verse>
  <verse number="38">But if I do, though you will not believe me, believe the works: that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="39">They sought therefore to take him; and he escaped out of their hands.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And he went again beyond the Jordan, into that place where John was baptizing first; and there he abode.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And many resorted to him, and they said: John indeed did no sign.</verse>
  <verse number="42">But all things whatsoever John said of this man, were true. And many believed in him.</verse>
