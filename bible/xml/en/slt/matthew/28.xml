  <verse number="1">And after the sabbaths, in the shining forth to one of the sabbaths, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to behold the tomb.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And, behold, there was a great shaking; for a messenger of the Lord, having come down out of heaven, having come near, rolled away the stone from the door, and sat above it.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And his aspect was as lightning, and his garment white as snow.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And from fear of him the keepers were shaken, and were as dead.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the messenger, having answered, said to the women, Be ye not afraid; for I know that ye seek Jesus, having been crucified.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He is not here: for he was raised, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And having gone quickly, say ye to his disciples, that he was raised from the dead; and, behold, he leads before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him: behold I have said to you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And they having come quickly from the tomb, with fear and great joy, ran to announce to his disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And as they were going to announce to his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, Rejoice ye. And they having come, held his feet firmly, and worshipped him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then says Jesus to them, Be ye not afraid: retire, and announce to my brethren that they should go away into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And they going, behold certain of the watch having come to the city, announced to the chief priests all having been done.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And having been gathered together with the elders, and having taken counsel, they gave sufficient silver coins to the soldiers,</verse>
  <verse number="13">Saying, Say ye, That his disciples having come by night, stole him, we being asleep.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And if this should be beard by the leader, we will persuade him, and we will make you undisturbed.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And they having received the silver coins, did as they were taught; and this word was spread a report by the Jews till this day.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, into a mountain, where Jesus commanded them:</verse>
  <verse number="17">And having seen him, they worshipped him; and some doubted.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Jesus, having come near, spake to them, saying, All power has been given me in heaven and upon earth:</verse>
  <verse number="19">Therefore, having gone, disciple all nations; immersing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit:</verse>
  <verse number="20">Teaching them to keep all things whatever I have commanded you; and behold, I am with you all the days, even to the end of time. Amen.</verse>
