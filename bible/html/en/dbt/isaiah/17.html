<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from [being] a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks; and they shall lie down and there shall be none to make them afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith Jehovah of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall become lean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And it shall be as when the reaper gathereth the corn, and reapeth the ears with his arm; yea, it shall be as he that gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And a gleaning shall be left in it, as at the shaking of an olive-tree: two, three berries above, in the tree-top; four, five in its fruitful boughs, saith Jehovah, the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In that day shall man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have regard to the Holy One of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he will not look to the altars, the work of his hands, nor have regard to what his fingers have made, neither the Asherahs nor the sun-images.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">In that day shall his strong cities be as the forsaken tract in the woodland, and the mountain-top which they forsook before the children of Israel; and there shall be desolation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength; therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plantations, and shalt set them with foreign slips:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">in the day of thy planting wilt thou make [them] to grow, and on the morrow wilt thou make thy seed to flourish; [but] the harvest will flee in the day of taking possession, and the sorrow will be incurable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Ha! a tumult of many peoples! they make a noise as the noise of the seas;â€”and the rushing of nations! they rush as the rushing of mighty waters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The nations rush as the rushing of many waters; but he will rebuke them, and they shall flee far away, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a whirling [of dust] before the whirlwind:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">behold, at eventide, trouble; before the morning they are not. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot of them that rob us.</p>
