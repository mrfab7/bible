<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Him being weak in faith receive ye, not to judgments of conversations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">One truly believes to eat all things: and he being weak eats vegetables.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Let not him eating despise him not eating: and let not him not eating judge him eating: for God has received him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who art thou judging anotherâ€™s servant? to his own lord he stands or falls. And he shall be made to stand: for God is powerful to make him stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For one truly judges day above day: and one judges every day. Let each one be perfectly certain in his own mind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He minding the day, minds to the Lord; and he not minding the day, to the Lord he minds not. He eating, eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he not eating, to the Lord he eats not, and he gives thanks to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For whether we live, to the Lord we live: and whether we die, to the Lord we die: therefore whether we live, and whether we die, we are of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For, for this Christ also died, and also arose, and returned again to life, that he might also reign over the dead and the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And why judgest thou thy brother? or why also despisest thou thy brother? for we shall all stand at the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For it has been written, I live, says the Lord, for to me shall every knee bend, and every tongue acknowledge to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">So therefore shall each of us give word for himself to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Then let us no more judge one another: but rather judge ye this, not to put a stumble or offence to thy brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing common by itself; except to any one reckoning to be common, to that one it is common.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And if by food thy brother is grieved, thou no more walkest by love. Not by thy food destroy him, for whom Christ died.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Therefore let not your good be defamed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the kingdom of God is not food and drink; but justice, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For he in these serving Christ, pleasing to God, and acceptable to men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">So therefore, let us pursue the things of peace, and the things for the building up for one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Not for sake of food destroy thou the work of God. Truly all things clean; but evil to the man eating by offence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Good not to eat flesh, nor drink wine, nor in what thy brother stumbles, or is offended, or is weak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Thou has faith; have to thyself before God. Happy he judging not himself in what he proves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he being judged if he eat, has been condemned for not of faith; and everything not of faith is sin.</p>
