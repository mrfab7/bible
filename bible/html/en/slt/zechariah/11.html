<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Open the doors, O Lebanon, and fire shall devour among thy cedars.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Wail, O cypress, for the cedar fell; for the powerful ones were destroyed: wail, ye oaks of Bashan, for the forest of the vintage went down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A voice of wailing of the shepherds, for their greatness was destroyed: a voice of the roaring of young lions, for the pride of Jordan was destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thus said Jehovah my God: Feed the flock of slaughter;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Which they possessing them will slaughter them, and they will not be punished: and they selling them will say, Blessed be Jehovah; and I shall be rich: and their shepherds had not pity upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For I will no more have pity upon the inhabitants of the land, says Jehovah: and behold, the men to be found each in the hand of his neighbor, and in the hand of his king: and they beat the land, and I will not deliver from their hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I will feed the flock of slaughter for you, and the poor of the sheep: And I will take to me two rods; to the one I called Beauty, and to the one, I called Cords; and I will feed the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And I will conceal three shepherds in one month; and my soul will be shortened for them, and also their soul loathed for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And saying, I will not feed you: the dying shall die, and the concealed shall be concealed; and they being left shall eat each the flesh of her neighbor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I will take my rod Beauty, and I will cut it off, to break my covenant which I cut out with all the peoples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And it shall be broken in that day: and the poor of the flock watching me knew that it was the word of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And saying to them, If good in your eyes, give ye my hire; and if not, desist. And they will weigh my hire, thirty of silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Jehovah will say to me, Cast it to the potter: a splendor of price which I was prized of them. And I shall take the thirty of silver and cast it in the house of Jehovah, to the potter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And I shall cut off my second rod, Cords, to break the brotherhood between Judah and between Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Jehovah will say to me, Yet take to thee the vessels of a foolish shepherd.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For behold, I raise up a shepherd in the land, he shall not review those being concealed; the youth he shall not seek, and he shall not heal the broken, and he shall not nourish the standing firmly: and he shall eat the flesh of the fading, and he shall break their hoofs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Wo! to the empty shepherd forsaking the sheep; the sword upon his arm, and upon his right eye: and his arm being dried up, shall be dried up, and his right eye being dim, shall be dim.</p>
