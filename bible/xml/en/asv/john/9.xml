  <verse number="1">And as he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">We must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</verse>
  <verse number="5">When I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="6">When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay,</verse>
  <verse number="7">and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The neighbors therefore, and they that saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am he.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They said therefore unto him, How then were thine eyes opened?</verse>
  <verse number="11">He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they said unto him, Where is he? He saith, I know not.</verse>
  <verse number="13">They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,</verse>
  <verse number="19">and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</verse>
  <verse number="20">His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</verse>
  <verse number="21">but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself.</verse>
  <verse number="22">These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</verse>
  <verse number="24">So they called a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner.</verse>
  <verse number="25">He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</verse>
  <verse number="26">They said therefore unto him, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</verse>
  <verse number="27">He answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples?</verse>
  <verse number="28">And they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="29">We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is.</verse>
  <verse number="30">The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and yet he opened mine eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="31">We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind.</verse>
  <verse number="33">If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="34">They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</verse>
  <verse number="36">He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?</verse>
  <verse number="37">Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they that see not may see; and that they that see may become blind.</verse>
  <verse number="40">Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind?</verse>
  <verse number="41">Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth.</verse>
