<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How long will ye hunt for words? Be intelligent, and then we will speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed stupid in your sight?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger, shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of its place?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the flame of his fire shall not shine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The light shall become dark in his tent, and his lamp over him shall be put out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For he is sent into the net by his own feet, and he walketh on the meshes;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The gin taketh [him] by the heel, the snare layeth hold on him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A cord is hidden for him in the ground, and his trap in the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Terrors make him afraid on every side, and chase him at his footsteps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">His strength is hunger-bitten, and calamity is ready at his side.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The firstborn of death devoureth the members of his body; it will devour his members.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">His confidence shall be rooted out of his tent, and it shall lead him away to the king of terrors:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">They who are none of his shall dwell in his tent; brimstone shall be showered upon his habitation:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name on the pasture-grounds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He is driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He hath neither son nor grandson among his people, nor any remaining in the places of his sojourn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">They that come after shall be astonished at his day, as they that went before [them] were affrighted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Surely, such are the dwellings of the unrighteous man, and such the place of him that knoweth not God.</p>
