<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Son of man, prophesy to the prophets of Israel who are prophesying, and you shall say to those who prophesy from their own heart: Hear the word of the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thus says the Lord God: Woe to the foolish prophets, who are following their own spirit, and who see nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Your prophets, O Israel, were like foxes in the deserts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">You have not gone up against the adversary, and you have not established a wall for the house of Israel, so as to stand in battle on the day of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">They see emptiness, and they foretell falsehoods, saying, ‘The Lord says,’ though the Lord has not sent them. And they continued to affirm what they said.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Have you not seen a futile vision and spoken a lying divination? And yet you say, ‘The Lord says,’ though I have not spoken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Because of this, thus says the Lord God: Since you have spoken emptiness and have seen falsehoods, therefore: behold, I am against you, says the Lord God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And my hand will be over the prophets who are seeing emptiness and divining lies. They shall not be in the council of my people, and they shall not be written in the writing of the house of Israel. Neither shall they enter into the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For they have deceived my people, saying, ‘Peace,’ and there is no peace. And they have built a wall, but they have covered it in clay without straw.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Say to those who spread mortar without mixing, that it will fall apart. For there will be an inundating rain, and I will cause full-grown hailstones to rush down from above, and a windstorm to dissipate it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">So then, behold: when the wall has fallen, will it not be said to you: ‘Where is the mortar with which you covered it?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Because of this, thus says the Lord God: And I will cause a violent wind to burst forth in my indignation, and there will be an inundating rain in my fury, and great hailstones in wrath, to consume.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And I will destroy the wall that you have covered without tempering it. And I will level it to the ground, and its foundation will be revealed. And it will fall and be consumed in its midst. And you shall know that I am the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And I will fulfill my indignation against the wall, and against those who cover it without mixing the mortar, and I will say to you: The wall is no more, and those who covered it are no more:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">the prophets of Israel, who prophesy to Jerusalem, and who see visions of peace for her when there is no peace, says the Lord God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And as for you, son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, who prophesy from their own heart. And prophesy about them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">and say: Thus says the Lord God: Woe to those who sew together little pillows under every forearm, and who make little cushions for the heads of every stage of life, in order to capture souls. And when they have seized the souls of my people, they became the life of their souls.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And they violated me among my people, for the sake of a handful of barley and a fragment of bread, so that they would kill the souls that should not die, and enliven the souls that should not live, lying to my people who believe in falsehoods.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Because of this, thus says the Lord God: Behold, I am against your little pillows, with which you catch flying souls. And I will tear them away from your arms. And I will release the souls that you are capturing, the souls that should fly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And I will tear away your little cushions. And I will free my people from your hand. And they shall no longer be a prey in your hands. And you shall know that I am the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For by deception you have caused the heart of the just to grieve, whom I would not sadden. And I have strengthened the hands of the impious, so that he would not be turned back from his evil way and live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Therefore, you shall not see emptiness, and you shall not divine divinations, any more. And I will rescue my people from your hand. And you shall know that I am the Lord.”</p>
