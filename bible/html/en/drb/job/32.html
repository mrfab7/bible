<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="32" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he seemed just to himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram, was angry and was moved to indignation : now he was angry against Job, because he said he was just before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he was angry with his friends because they had not found a reasonable answer, but only had condemned Job.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">So Eliu waited while Job was speaking, because they were his elders that were speaking.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But when he saw that the three were not able to answer, he was exceedingly angry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said : I am younger in days, and you are more ancient; therefore hanging down my head, I was afraid to shew you my opinion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For I hoped that greater age would speak, and that a multitude of years would teach wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But, as I see, there is a spirit in men, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They that are aged are not the wise men, neither do the ancients understand judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore I will speak : Hearken to me, I also will shew you my wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For I have waited for your words, I have given ear to your wisdom, as long as you were disputing in words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And as long as I thought you said some thing, I considered : but, as I see, there is none of you that can convince Job, and answer his words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Lest you should say : We have found wisdom, God hath cast him down, not man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He hath spoken nothing to me, and I will not answer him according to your words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">They were afraid, and answered no more, and they left off speaking.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Therefore because I have waited, and they have not spoken : they stood, and answered no more :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I also will answer my part, and will shew my knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18"></p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Behold, my belly is as new wine which wanteth vent, which bursteth the new vessels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I will speak and take breath a little : I will open my lips, and will answer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">I will not accept the person of man, and I will not level God with man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For I know not how long I shall continue, and whether after a while my Maker may take me away.</p>
