  <verse number="7">Like him estimating evil in his soul, so is he: Eat and drink, he will say to thee; and his heart not with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thy morsel which thou didst eat thou shalt vomit forth and destroy thy pleasant words.</verse>
  <verse number="9">In the ears of the foolish thou shalt not speak, for he will despise for the understanding of thy words.</verse>

  <verse number="35">They struck me, I was not pained; they beat me, I knew not: when shall I awake? I will add, I will yet seek it.</verse>
