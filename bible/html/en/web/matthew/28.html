<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now after the Sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from the sky, and came and rolled away the stone from the door, and sat on it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For fear of him, the guards shook, and became like dead men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The angel answered the women, “Don’t be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, who has been crucified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He is not here, for he has risen, just like he said. Come, see the place where the Lord was lying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead, and behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there you will see him.’ Behold, I have told you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to bring his disciples word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">As they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, “Rejoice!” They came and took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Go tell my brothers that they should go into Galilee, and there they will see me.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Now while they were going, behold, some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all the things that had happened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When they were assembled with the elders, and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of silver to the soldiers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">saying, “Say that his disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you free of worry.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">So they took the money and did as they were told. This saying was spread abroad among the Jews, and continues until this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had sent them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">When they saw him, they bowed down to him, but some doubted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Jesus came to them and spoke to them, saying, “All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Go, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you. Behold, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen.</p>
