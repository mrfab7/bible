<chapter book="Joshua" number="5" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And it will be as all the kings of the Amorites heard which were beyond Jordan to the sea, and all the kings of the Canaanites which were upon the sea, that Jehovah dried up the water of Jordan from before the sons of Israel till we passed over, and their heart will melt; and there was no more spirit in them from the face of the sons of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="2">In that time Jehovah said to Joshua, Make to thee swords of stone, and turning back, circumcise the sons of Israel the second time.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Joshua will make to him swords of stone and will circumcise the sons of Israel at the hill of uncircumcisions:</verse>
  <verse number="4">And this the reason that Joshua circumcised: all the people came forth out of Egypt, the males, all the men of war, died in the desert in the way, in their coming out of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For all the people coming out were circumcised; and all the people born in the desert in the way, in their coming out of Egypt, were not circumcised.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For forty years the sons of Israel went in the desert till all the people of the men of war coming out of Egypt were finished, who heard not to the voice of Jehovah: which Jehovah sware to them, not for them to see the land which Jehovah sware to their fathers to give to us, a land flowing milk and honey.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And their sons he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised, for they circumcised them not in the way.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it shall be as all the people finished to be circumcised, and they dwelt in their place in the camp till they revived.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Jehovah will say to Joshua, This day I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. And he will call the name of that place Gilgal till this day.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the sons of Israel will encamp in Gilgal, and they will do the passover in the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, in the plain of Jericho.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And they will eat from the grain of the land from the morrow of the passover, unleavened and roasted in the self-same day.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the manna will cease from the morrow in their eating from the grain of the land; and manna was no more to the sons of Israel; and they will eat from the produce of the land of Canaan in that year.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And it will be in Joshua’s being by Jericho, and he will lift up his eyes and will see, and behold, a man standing before him and his sword drawn in his hand; and Joshua will go to him and say to him, Art thou for us or for our adversaries?</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he will say, No; but I chief of the army of Jehovah come now. And Joshua will fall on his face to the earth and will worship him, and will say to him, What speaks my lord to his servant?</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the captain of Jehovah’s host will say to Joshua, Put off thy shoe from thy foot, for the place which thou standest upon it, it is holy: and Joshua will do so.</verse>
