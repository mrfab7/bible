<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Draw near, ye nations, to hear; and ye people, attend: the earth shall hear, and its fulness; the habitable globe, and all its offspring.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For the wrath of Jehovah is upon all nations, And anger upon all their army: he devoted them to destruction, he gave them to slaughter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And their wounded shall be cast out, and their carcasses the stench shall go up, and the mountains flowed down from their blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And all the army of the heavens melted, and the heavens shall roll together as a book, and all their army shall fall away as the leaf falling from the vine, and as a falling from the fig tree.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For my sword was drunk in the heavens: behold, it shall come down upon Edom, and upon the people of destruction for judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The sword of Jehovah was filled with blood, it was made fat from the fat of the blood of lambs and he goats, from the fat of kidneys of rams: for a sacrifice to Jehovah in Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Edom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the buffaloes shall come down with them, and the bullocks with the strong ones; and their land was drunk from blood, and from fat shall their dust be made fat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For a day of vengeance to Jehovah, a year of retributions for the contention of Zion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And its torrents turned to pitch, and its dust to sulphur, and its land to burning pitch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Night and day it shall not be quenched; its smoke shall go up forever: from generation to generation it shall be laid waste; none passing through it forever to forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the pelican and the hedgehog shall possess it; the ibis and the raven shall dwell in it: and he stretched out upon it the line of desolation and the stones of emptiness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Its nobles shall be called to the kingdom, and none there, and all its chiefs shall be no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And thorns came up in her palaces, the nettle and the thorn bush in her fortifications, and it was a dwelling of jackals, an enclosure for the daughters of the ostrich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And animals of the desert lighted upon the howlers, and the he goat shall call to his neighbor; also there the night spectre rested, and found for herself a resting place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">There the arrow-snake nested, and she will lay eggs and hatch, and brood in her shadow: also there the falcons were collected, the female with her companion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Seek ye from the book of Jehovah, and read: One of these was not wanting; a female her companion they missed not: for my mouth it commanded, and his spirit it collected them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And be cast the lot for them, and his hand divided it to them by line; they shall possess it even forever, to generation and generation they shall dwell in it.</p>
