<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Give not your strength to women, nor your ways to that which destroys kings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Give strong drink to him that is ready to perish, and wine to those that be of heavy hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Open your mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Open your mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The heart of her husband does safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">She seeks wool, and flax, and works willingly with her hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">She is like the merchantsâ€™ ships; she brings her food from afar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">She rises also while it is yet night, and gives meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">She considers a field, and buys it: with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">She girds her loins with strength, and strengthens her arms.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">She perceives that her merchandise is good: her candle goes not out by night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">She lays her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">She stretches out her hand to the poor; yes, she reaches forth her hands to the needy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">She makes herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Her husband is known in the gates, when he sits among the elders of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">She makes fine linen, and sells it; and delivers girdles to the merchant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Strength and honor are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">She opens her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">She looks well to the ways of her household, and eats not the bread of idleness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Many daughters have done virtuously, but you excel them all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Favor is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that fears the LORD, she shall be praised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.</p>
