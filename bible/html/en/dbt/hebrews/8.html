<div class="chapter" data-book="Hebrews" data-chapter="8" data-translation="Darby Bible Translation" data-translation-id="dbt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now a summary of the things of which we are speaking [is], We have such a one high priest who has sat down on [the] right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">minister of the holy places and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched, [and] not man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For every high priest is constituted for the offering both of gifts and sacrifices; whence it is needful that this one also should have something which he may offer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If then indeed he were upon earth, he would not even be a priest, there being those who offer the gifts according to the law,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">(who serve the representation and shadow of heavenly things, according as Moses was oracularly told [when] about to make the tabernacle; for See, saith He, that thou make all things according to the pattern which has been shewn to thee in the mountain.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But now he has got a more excellent ministry, by so much as he is mediator of a better covenant, which is established on the footing of better promises.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For if that first was faultless, place had not been sought for a second.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For finding fault, he says to them, Behold, days come, saith the Lord, and I will consummate a new covenant as regards the house of Israel, and as regards the house of Juda;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">not according to the covenant which I made to their fathers in [the] day of my taking their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they did not continue in my covenant, and I did not regard them, saith [the] Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Because this [is] the covenant that I will covenant to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: Giving my laws into their mind, I will write them also upon their hearts; and I will be to them for God, and they shall be to me for people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And they shall not teach each his fellow-citizen, and each his brother, saying, Know the Lord; because all shall know me in themselves, from [the] little one [among them] unto [the] great among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Because I will be merciful to their unrighteousnesses, and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will never remember any more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">In that he says New, he has made the first old; but that which grows old and aged [is] near disappearing.</p>
