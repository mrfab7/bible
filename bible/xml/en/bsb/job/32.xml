<chapter book="Job" number="32" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="2">This kindled the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram. He burned with anger against Job for justifying himself rather than God,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and he burned with anger against Job’s three friends because they had failed to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because the others were older than he.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But when he saw that the three men had no further reply, his anger was kindled.</verse>
  <verse number="6">So Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite declared: “I am young in years, while you are old; that is why I was timid and afraid to tell you what I know.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I thought that age should speak, and many years should teach wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But there is a spirit in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="9">It is not only the old who are wise, or the elderly who understand justice.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me; I too will declare what I know.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">Indeed, I waited while you spoke; I listened to your reasoning; as you searched for words,</verse>
  <verse number="12">I paid you full attention. But no one proved Job wrong; not one of you rebutted his arguments.</verse>
  <verse number="13">So do not claim, ‘We have found wisdom; let God, not man, refute him.’</verse>
  <verse number="14">But Job has not directed his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Job’s friends are dismayed, with no more to say; words have escaped them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand and no longer reply?</verse>
  <verse number="17">I too will answer; yes, I will declare what I know.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For I am full of words, and my spirit within me compels me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Behold, my belly is like unvented wine; it is about to burst like a new wineskin.</verse>
  <verse number="20">I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and respond.</verse>
  <verse number="21">I will be partial to no one, nor will I flatter any man.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For I do not know how to flatter, or my Maker would remove me in an instant.</verse>
