<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“My spirit is broken; my days are extinguished; the grave awaits me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Surely mockers surround me, and my eyes must gaze at their rebellion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Give me, I pray, the pledge You demand. Who else will be my guarantor?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">You have closed their minds to understanding; therefore You will not exalt them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If a man denounces his friends for a price, the eyes of his children will fail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He has made me a byword among the people, a man in whose face they spit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">My eyes have grown dim with grief, and my whole body is but a shadow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The upright are appalled at this, and the innocent are stirred against the godless.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Yet a righteous one holds to his way, and the one with clean hands grows stronger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But come back and try again, all of you. For I will not find a wise man among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My days have passed; my plans are broken off—even the desires of my heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They have turned night into day, making light seem near in the face of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I look for Sheol as my home, if I spread out my bed in darkness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and say to corruption, ‘You are my father,’ and to the worm, ‘My mother,’ or ‘My sister,’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">where then is my hope? Who can see any hope for me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Will it go down to the gates of Sheol? Will we go down together into the dust?”</p>
