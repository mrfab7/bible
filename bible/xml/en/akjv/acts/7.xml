  <verse number="1">Then said the high priest, Are these things so?</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he said, Men, brothers, and fathers, listen; The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelled in Charran,</verse>
  <verse number="3">And said to him, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and come into the land which I shall show you.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelled in Charran: and from there, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein you now dwell.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And God spoke on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,</verse>
  <verse number="10">And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brothers; and Joseph’s kindred was made known to Pharaoh.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, three score and fifteen souls.</verse>
  <verse number="15">So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,</verse>
  <verse number="16">And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But when the time of the promise drew near, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,</verse>
  <verse number="18">Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The same dealt subtly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.</verse>
  <verse number="20">In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father’s house three months:</verse>
  <verse number="21">And when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:</verse>
  <verse number="25">For he supposed his brothers would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the next day he showed himself to them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, you are brothers; why do you wrong one to another?</verse>
  <verse number="27">But he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?</verse>
  <verse number="28">Will you kill me, as you did the Egyptian yesterday?</verse>
  <verse number="29">Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush.</verse>
  <verse number="31">When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the LORD came to him,</verse>
  <verse number="32">Saying, I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and dared not behold.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Then said the Lord to him, Put off your shoes from your feet: for the place where you stand is holy ground.</verse>
  <verse number="34">I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you into Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="35">This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.</verse>
  <verse number="36">He brought them out, after that he had showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years.</verse>
  <verse number="37">This is that Moses, which said to the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brothers, like to me; him shall you hear.</verse>
  <verse number="38">This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spoke to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give to us:</verse>
  <verse number="39">To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,</verse>
  <verse number="40">Saying to Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.</verse>
  <verse number="42">Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O you house of Israel, have you offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?</verse>
  <verse number="43">Yes, you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which you made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking to Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers, to the days of David;</verse>
  <verse number="46">Who found favor before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="47">But Solomon built him an house.</verse>
  <verse number="48">However, the most High dwells not in temples made with hands; as said the prophet,</verse>
  <verse number="49">Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will you build me? said the Lord: or what is the place of my rest?</verse>
  <verse number="50">Has not my hand made all these things?</verse>
  <verse number="51">You stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do you.</verse>
  <verse number="52">Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which showed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom you have been now the betrayers and murderers:</verse>
  <verse number="53">Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.</verse>
  <verse number="54">When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="55">But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,</verse>
  <verse number="56">And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.</verse>
  <verse number="57">Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran on him with one accord,</verse>
  <verse number="58">And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man’s feet, whose name was Saul.</verse>
  <verse number="59">And they stoned Stephen, calling on God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="60">And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.</verse>
