  <verse number="1">And he said to his disciples, It cannot be but that offences come, but woe [to him] by whom they come!</verse>
  <verse number="2">It would be [more] profitable for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea, than that he should be a snare to one of these little ones.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Take heed to yourselves: if thy brother should sin, rebuke him; and if he should repent, forgive him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And if he should sin against thee seven times in the day, and seven times should return to thee, saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the apostles said to the Lord, Give more faith to us.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But the Lord said, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard [seed], ye had said to this sycamine tree, Be thou rooted up, and be thou planted in the sea, and it would have obeyed you.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But which of you [is there] who, having a bondman ploughing or shepherding, when he comes in out of the field, will say, Come and lie down immediately to table?</verse>
  <verse number="8">But will he not say to him, Prepare what I shall sup on, and gird thyself and serve me that I may eat and drink; and after that thou shalt eat and drink?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Is he thankful to the bondman because he has done what was ordered? I judge not.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Thus ye also, when ye shall have done all things that have been ordered you, say, We are unprofitable bondmen; we have done what it was our duty to do.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it came to pass as he was going up to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And as he entered into a certain village ten leprous men met him, who stood afar off.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And they lifted up [their] voice saying, Jesus, Master, have compassion on us.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And seeing [them] he said to them, Go, shew yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass as they were going they were cleansed.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And one of them, seeing that he was cured, turned back, glorifying God with a loud voice,</verse>
  <verse number="16">and fell on [his] face at his feet giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Jesus answering said, Were not the ten cleansed? but the nine, where [are they]?</verse>
  <verse number="18">There have not been found to return and give glory to God save this stranger.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And he said to him, Rise up and go thy way: thy faith has made thee well.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And having been asked by the Pharisees, When is the kingdom of God coming? he answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation;</verse>
  <verse number="21">nor shall they say, Lo here, or, Lo there; for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he said to the disciples, Days are coming, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and shall not see [it].</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they will say to you, Lo here, or Lo there; go not, nor follow [them].</verse>
  <verse number="24">For as the lightning shines which lightens from [one end] under heaven to [the other end] under heaven, thus shall the Son of man be in his day.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But first he must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And as it took place in the days of Noe, thus also shall it be in the days of the Son of man:</verse>
  <verse number="27">they ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed all [of them];</verse>
  <verse number="28">and in like manner as took place in the days of Lot: they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;</verse>
  <verse number="29">but on the day that Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and sulphur from heaven, and destroyed all [of them]:</verse>
  <verse number="30">after this [manner] shall it be in the day that the Son of man is revealed.</verse>
  <verse number="31">In that day, he who shall be on the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not go down to take it away; and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Remember the wife of Lot.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it, and whosoever shall lose it shall preserve it.</verse>
  <verse number="34">I say to you, In that night there shall be two [men] upon one bed; one shall be seized and the other shall be let go.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Two [women] shall be grinding together; the one shall be seized and the other shall be let go.</verse>
  <verse number="36">[Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be seized and the other let go.]</verse>
  <verse number="37">And answering they say to him, Where, Lord? And he said to them, Where the body [is], there the eagles will be gathered together.</verse>
