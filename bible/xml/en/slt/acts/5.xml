  <verse number="1">And a certain man, Ananias by name, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,</verse>
  <verse number="2">And separated from the price, his wife also knowing; and having brought a certain part, laid at the feet of the sent.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Peter said, Ananias, wherefore filled Satan thy heart, for thee to belie the Holy Spirit, and separate from the price of the farm.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Remaining, did it not remain to thee? and sold, it was in thy power: for what hast thou put this thing in thy heart? thou hast not lied to men, but to God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Ananias hearing these words, having fallen down, he expired: and great fear was upon all them hearing these things.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the younger having risen up, drew him together, and having carried out, interred.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And there was an interval of about three hours, and his wife not knowing that done, came in.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Peter answered to her, Tell me, if for so much ye sold the farm? And she said, Yes, for so much.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Peter said to her, For what was it agreed by you to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them having interred thy husband at the door, and they shall carry thee out.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And she fell immediately at his feet, and expired: and the young men having come in, found her dead, and having carried out, interred near her husband.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And great fear was upon the whole church, and upon all having heard these things.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And by the bands of the sent were many signs and wonders among the people; (and all were unanimously in Solomon’s porch.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And of them remaining none dared join them: but the people magnified them.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the believing were the more added to the Lord, multitudes of men and also of women.)</verse>
  <verse number="15">So that the sick were brought into the streets, and laid upon beds and couches, that Peter coming, even the shadow might overshadow certain of them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And a multitude also came together of them all around the cities to Jerusalem, bringing the sick, and the molested by unclean spirits: who were all healed.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the chief priest having risen, and all they with him, (the sect being of the Sadducees,) they were filled with zeal,</verse>
  <verse number="18">And put their hands upon the sent, and set them in the public keeping.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And a messenger of the Lord by night opened the doors of the prison, and having brought them forth, said,</verse>
  <verse number="20">Go ye, and having stood, speak in the temple all the words of this life.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And having heard, they came in by morning to the temple, and taught. But the chief priest having approached, and they with him, called the council together, and all the assembly of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison for them to be brought.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the attendants having come near, found them not in the prison, and having returned, they announced,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Saying, That we truly found the prison shut with all security, and the watch standing without before the doors: and having opened, we found none within.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And when the priest and captain of the temple and chief priests heard these words, they were in doubt of them, what this might be.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And a certain one having come near, announced to them, saying, That, behold, the men which ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Then the commander having gone with attendants, brought them, not with force: for they feared the people, lest they might be stoned.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And having brought them, they set in the council: and the chief priest asked them,</verse>
  <verse number="28">Saying, Did we not announce to you by order, not to teach by this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and ye desire to bring upon us this man’s blood.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Peter having answered, and the sent, said, We must obey God rather than men.</verse>
  <verse number="30">The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew with your own hands, having hung him upon a tree.</verse>
  <verse number="31">This, God exalted, a Chief and Saviour, with his right hand to give repentance to Israel, and remission of sins.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And we are his witnesses of these words; and the Holy Spirit, whom God gave to them obeying him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And having heard, they gnashed the teeth with rage, and consulted to kill them.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And a certain Pharisee having risen up in the council, by name Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, honoured by all the people, urged to put the sent without a little while.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And he said to them, Men, Israelites, attend to yourselves on account of these men, what ye are about to do.</verse>
  <verse number="36">For before these days Theudas arose, saying himself to be somebody: which a number of men followed, about four hundred, who was slain; and all, as many as believed him, were destroyed, and were for nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="37">After this Judas the Galilean arose in the days of enrolling, and misled enough people after him: and he perished; and all, as many as believed him, were scattered.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And now say I to you, Depart from these men, and leave them; for if this counsel or this work be of men, it shall be destroyed:</verse>
  <verse number="39">And if it is of God, ye cannot destroy it; lest ye also be found contenders against God.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And by him they were persuaded: and having called the sent, having stripped, they enjoined not to speak in the name of Jesus, and loosed them.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Truly therefore they went rejoicing from the face of the council, that for his name they were deemed worthy to be dishonoured.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And every day in the temple, and at the house, they ceased not teaching and announcing the good news, Jesus the Christ.</verse>
