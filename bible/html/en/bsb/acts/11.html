<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The apostles and brothers throughout Judea soon heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers took issue with him</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and said, “You visited uncircumcised men and ate with them.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But Peter began and explained to them the whole sequence of events:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">“I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision of something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came right down to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I looked at it closely and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Then I heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter, kill and eat.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">‘No, Lord,’ I said, ‘for nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But the voice spoke from heaven a second time, ‘Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">This happened three times, and everything was drawn back up into heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Just then three men sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The Spirit told me to accompany them without hesitation. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s home.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He told us how he had seen an angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He will convey to you a message by which you and all your household will be saved.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, just as He had fallen upon us at the beginning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Then I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">So if God gave them the same gift He gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to hinder the work of God?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">When they heard this, they had no further objections, and they glorified God, saying, “So then, God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Meanwhile those scattered by the persecution that began with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the message only to Jews.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But some of them, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began speaking to the Greeks as well, proclaiming the good news about the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">When news of this reached the ears of the church in Jerusalem, they sent Barnabas to Antioch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced and encouraged them all to abide in the Lord with all their hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Barnabas was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith, and a great number of people were brought to the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">and when he found him, he brought him back to Antioch. So for a full year they met together with the church and taught large numbers of people. The disciples were first called Christians at Antioch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">In those days some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">One of them named Agabus stood up and predicted through the Spirit that a great famine would sweep across the whole world. (This happened under Claudius.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">So the disciples, each according to his ability, decided to send relief to the brothers living in Judea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">This they did, sending their gifts to the elders with Barnabas and Saul.</p>
