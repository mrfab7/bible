<p class="verse" data-verse="48">This is the possession of the tribe of the sons of Dan, by their families, the cities and their villages.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">And when he had completed dividing the land by lot to each one by their tribes, the sons of Israel gave a possession to Joshua, the son of Nun, in their midst,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">in accord with the precept of the Lord, the city he requested, Timnath-Serah, on mount Ephraim. And he built up the city, and he lived in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">These are the possessions which Eleazar, the priest, and Joshua, the son of Nun, and the leaders of the families and tribes of the sons of Israel divided by lot at Shiloh, before the Lord, at the door of the Tabernacle of the Testimony. And so did they divide the land.</p>
