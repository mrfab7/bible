<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the soldiers plaited a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple garment;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and they came unto him, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they struck him with their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Pilate went out again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find no crime in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. And Pilate saith unto them, Behold, the man!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I find no crime in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and he entered into the palace again, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar’s friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Now it was the Preparation of the passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your King!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">They therefore cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">They took Jesus therefore: and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, unto the place called The place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">This title therefore read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and in Latin, and in Greek.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but, that he said, I am King of the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my garments among them, And upon my vesture did they cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold, thy son!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own home.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought it to his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath (for the day of that sabbath was a high day), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took away his body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">There then because of the Jews’ Preparation (for the tomb was nigh at hand) they laid Jesus.</p>
