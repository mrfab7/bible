  <verse number="1">And the LORD appeared to him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he lifted up his eyes and looked, and lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,</verse>
  <verse number="3">And said, My Lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:</verse>
  <verse number="4">Let a little water, I pray you, be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:</verse>
  <verse number="5">And I will bring a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that you shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Abraham hastened into the tent to Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Abraham ran to the herd, and brought a calf tender and good, and gave it to a young man; and he hasted to dress it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they ate.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they said to him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And he said, I will certainly return to thee according to the time of life; and lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Now Abraham and Sarah were old and far advanced in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am become old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the LORD said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I certainly bear a child, who am old?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I will return to thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;</verse>
  <verse number="18">Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</verse>
  <verse number="19">For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they will keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;</verse>
  <verse number="21">I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come to me; and if not, I will know.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the men turned their faces from thence, and went towards Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are in it?</verse>
  <verse number="25">That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I, who am dust and ashes, have taken upon me to speak to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Peradventure there will lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he spoke to him yet again, and said, Peradventure there will be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty’s sake.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And he said, Oh, let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there will thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak to the Lord: Peradventure there will be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty’s sake.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten will be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten’s sake.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place.</verse>
