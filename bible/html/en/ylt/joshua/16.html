<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the lot for the sons of Joseph goeth out from Jordan by Jericho, to the waters of Jericho on the east, to the wilderness going up from Jericho in the hill-country of Beth-El,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and hath gone out from Beth-El to Luz, and passed over unto the border of Archi to Ataroth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and gone down westward unto the border of Japhleti, unto the border of Beth-Horon the lower, and unto Gezer, and its outgoings have been at the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the sons of Joseph—Manasseh and Ephraim—inherit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the border of the sons of Ephraim is by their families; and the border of their inheritance is on the east, Atroth-Addar unto Beth-Horon the upper;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and the border hath gone out at the sea, to Michmethah on the north, and the border hath gone round eastward to Taanath-Shiloh, and passed over it eastward to Janohah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and gone down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and touched against Jericho, and gone out at the Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">From Tappuah the border goeth westward unto the brook of Kanah, and its outgoings have been at the sea: this is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim, for their families.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the separate cities of the sons of Ephraim are in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh, all the cities and their villages;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and they have not dispossessed the Canaanite who is dwelling in Gezer, and the Canaanite dwelleth in the midst of Ephraim unto this day, and is to tribute—a servant.</p>
