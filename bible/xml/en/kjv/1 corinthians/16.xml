  <verse number="1">Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Upon the first [day] of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as [God] hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by [your] letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and [there are] many adversaries.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also [do].</verse>
  <verse number="11">Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="12">As touching [our] brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Let all your things be done with charity.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and [that] they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)</verse>
  <verse number="16">That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with [us], and laboureth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.</verse>
  <verse number="20">All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The salutation of [me] Paul with mine own hand.</verse>
  <verse number="22">If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you.</verse>
  <verse number="24">My love [be] with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.</verse>
