<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="10" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My soul is weary of my life; I will give free course to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Hast thou eyes of flesh, or seest thou as man seeth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Are thy days as the days of man, or thy years as manâ€™s days,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Although thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Thine hands have framed me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast fashioned me as clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Yet these things thou didst hide in thine heart; I know that this is with thee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet shall I not lift up my head; being filled with ignominy and looking upon mine affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And if my head exalt itself, thou huntest me as a lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvelous upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and warfare are with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A land of thick darkness, as darkness itself; a land of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.</p>
