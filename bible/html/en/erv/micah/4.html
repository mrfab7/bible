<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But in the latter days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the LORDâ€™S house shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and peoples shall flow unto it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And many nations shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and he shall judge between many peoples, and shall reprove strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the LORD of hosts hath spoken it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For all the peoples will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven away, and her that I have afflicted;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth even for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And thou, O tower of the flock, the hill of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come; yea, the former dominion shall come, the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Now why dost thou cry out aloud? Is there no king in thee, is thy counsellor perished, that pangs have taken hold of thee as of a woman in travail?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and shalt dwell in the field, and shalt come even unto Babylon; there shalt thou be rescued; there shall the LORD redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And now many nations are assembled against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye see its desire upon Zion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand they his counsel: for he hath gathered them as the sheaves to the threshingfloor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many peoples: and thou shalt devote their gain unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.</p>
