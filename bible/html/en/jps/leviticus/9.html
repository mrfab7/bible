<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and he said unto Aaron: ‘Take thee a bull-calf for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying: Take ye a he-goat for a sin-offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt-offering;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and an ox and a ram for peace-offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meal-offering mingled with oil; for to-day the LORD appeareth unto you.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tent of meeting; and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Moses said: ‘This is the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do; that the glory of the LORD may appear unto you.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And Moses said unto Aaron: ‘Draw near unto the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people; and present the offering of the people, and make atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">So Aaron drew near unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin-offering, which was for himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the sons of Aaron presented the blood unto him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But the fat, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver of the sin-offering, he made smoke upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the flesh and the skin were burnt with fire without the camp.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And he slew the burnt-offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood, and he dashed it against the altar round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And they delivered the burnt-offering unto him, piece by piece, and the head; and he made them smoke upon the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he washed the inwards and the legs, and made them smoke upon the burnt-offering on the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the people’s offering was presented; and he took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the burnt-offering was presented; and he offered it according to the ordinance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the meal-offering was presented; and he filled his hand therefrom, and made it smoke upon the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He slew also the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace-offerings, which was for the people; and Aaron’s sons delivered unto him the blood, and he dashed it against the altar round about,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and the fat of the ox, and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he made the fat smoke upon the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave-offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out, and blessed the people; and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And there came forth fire from before the LORD, and consumed upon the altar the burnt-offering and the fat; and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</p>
