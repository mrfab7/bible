  <verse number="1">Christ has set us free in freedom; stand fast therefore, and be not held again in a yoke of bondage.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Behold, I, Paul, say to you, that if ye are circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I witness again to every man [who is] circumcised, that he is debtor to do the whole law.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Ye are deprived of all profit from the Christ as separated [from him], as many as are justified by law; ye have fallen from grace.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For we, by [the] Spirit, on the principle of faith, await the hope of righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any force, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Ye ran well; who has stopped you that ye should not obey the truth?</verse>
  <verse number="8">The persuasibleness [is] not of him that calls you.</verse>
  <verse number="9">A little leaven leavens the whole lump.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I have confidence as to you in [the] Lord, that ye will have no other mind; and he that is troubling you shall bear the guilt [of it], whosoever he may be.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why am I yet persecuted? Then the scandal of the cross has been done away.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I would that they would even cut themselves off who throw you into confusion.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For ye have been called to liberty, brethren; only [do] not [turn] liberty into an opportunity to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;</verse>
  <verse number="15">but if ye bite and devour one another, see that ye are not consumed one of another.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But I say, Walk in [the] Spirit, and ye shall no way fulfil flesh’s lust.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these things are opposed one to the other, that ye should not do those things which ye desire;</verse>
  <verse number="18">but if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under law.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, uncleanness, licentiousness,</verse>
  <verse number="20">idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strifes, jealousies, angers, contentions, disputes, schools of opinion,</verse>
  <verse number="21">envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revels, and things like these; as to which I tell you beforehand, even as I also have said before, that they who do such things shall not inherit God’s kingdom.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, fidelity,</verse>
  <verse number="23">meekness, self-control: against such things there is no law.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But they that [are] of the Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts.</verse>
  <verse number="25">If we live by the Spirit, let us walk also by the Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Let us not become vain-glorious, provoking one another, envying one another.</verse>
