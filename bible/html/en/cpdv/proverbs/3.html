<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="3" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, do not forget my law, but let your heart guard my precepts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For they shall set before you length of days, and years of life, and peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Let not mercy and truth abandon you: encircle them around your throat, and inscribe them on the tablets of your heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And so shall you discover grace and good discipline, in the sight of God and men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Have confidence in the Lord with all your heart, and do not depend upon your own prudence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In all your ways, consider him, and he himself will direct your steps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Do not seem wise to yourself. Fear God, and withdraw from evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Certainly, it shall be health to your navel, and refreshment to your bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Honor the Lord with your substance, and give to him from the first of all your fruits,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and then your storehouses will be filled with abundance, and your presses shall overflow with wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My son, do not discard the discipline of the Lord, and do not fall away when you are corrected by him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For whomever the Lord loves, he corrects, and just as a father does with a son, he wins him over.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Blessed is the man who finds wisdom and who advances to prudence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Her acquisition is better than trading in silver, and her fruit is better than the first and purest gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">She is more precious than all riches, and all that can be desired cannot prevail in comparison to her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Length of days is at her right hand, and at her left hand is wealth and glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Her ways are beautiful ways, and all her paths are peaceful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">She is a tree of life to those who overtake her, and he who shall take hold of her is blessed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The Lord founded the earth on wisdom. He secured the heavens with prudence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">By his wisdom, the abyss erupted and the clouds increased with dew.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">My son, let not these things move away from your eyes. Preserve law as well as counsel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And so shall there be life in your soul and grace in your voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Then you shall walk confidently in your way, and your feet will not stumble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">When you slumber, you shall not fear. When you rest, your sleep also will be sweet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Do not fear unexpected terror, nor the power of the impious falling upon you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For the Lord will be at your side, and he will guard your feet, so that you may not be seized.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Do not prevent him who is able from doing good. When you are able, do good yourself too.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Do not say to your friend: “Go away, and then return. Tomorrow I will give to you.” When you are able to do so, give in the present.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Do not undertake evil against your friend, even though he has trust in you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Do not contend against a man without cause, even though he has done no evil to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Do not rival an unjust man, and do not imitate his ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For everyone who ridicules is an abomination to the Lord, and his communication is for the simple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Destitution in the house of the impious is from the Lord. But the habitations of the just shall be blessed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">He will ridicule those who ridicule, but he will bestow grace upon the mild.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">The wise will possess glory. The exaltation of the foolish is disgraceful.</p>
