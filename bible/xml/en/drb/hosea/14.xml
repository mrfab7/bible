  <verse number="4">I will heal their breaches, I will love them freely: for my wrath is turned away from them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I will be as the dew, Israel shall spring as the lily, and his root shall shoot forth as that of Libanus.</verse>

  <verse number="7">They shall be converted that sit under his shadow: they shall live upon wheat, and they shall blossom as a vine: his memorial shall be as the wine of Libanus.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I will hear him, and I will make him flourish like a green fir tree: from me is thy fruit found.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know these things? for the ways of the Lord are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall in them.</verse>
