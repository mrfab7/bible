<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Hear ye now what Jehovah saith: Arise, contend before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear, ye mountains, Jehovah’s controversy, and ye, unchanging foundations of the earth; for Jehovah hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">My people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the righteousness of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Wherewith shall I come before Jehovah, bow myself before the high God? Shall I come before him with burnt-offerings, with calves of a year old?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Will Jehovah take pleasure in thousands of rams, in ten thousands of rivers of oil? Shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He hath shewn thee, O man, what is good: and what doth Jehovah require of thee, but to do justly, and to love goodness, and to walk humbly with thy God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Jehovah’s voice crieth unto the city, and wisdom looketh on thy name. Hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Are there yet treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure [which is] abominable?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Shall I be pure with the unjust balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For her rich men are full of violence, and her inhabitants speak lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Therefore also will I make [thee] sick in smiting thee; I will make [thee] desolate because of thy sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thou shalt eat, and not be satisfied, and thine emptiness [shall remain] in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take away, and not save; and what thou savest will I give up to the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and new wine, but shalt not drink wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab; and ye walk in their counsels: that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof a hissing; and ye shall bear the reproach of my people.</p>
