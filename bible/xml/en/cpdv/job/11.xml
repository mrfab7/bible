<chapter book="Job" number="11" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But Zophar the Naamathite, responding, said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Will he who speaks much, not also listen? Or will a talkative man be justified?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Will men be silent only for you? And when you have mocked others, will no one refute you?</verse>
  <verse number="4">For you said: “My word is pure, and I am clean in your sight.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">Yet I wish that God would speak with you, and would open his lips to you,</verse>
  <verse number="6">so that he might reveal to you the secrets of wisdom, and how intricate his law is, and that you would understand how much less he requires of you than your iniquity deserves.</verse>
  <verse number="7">By chance, will you comprehend the footsteps of God and reach all the way to the perfection of the Almighty?</verse>
  <verse number="8">He is higher than heaven, and what will you do? He is deeper than hell, but how will you know?</verse>
  <verse number="9">His measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If he overturns all things, or packs them together, who will contradict him?</verse>
  <verse number="11">For he knows the vanity of men, and when he sees iniquity, does he not evaluate it?</verse>
  <verse number="12">A vain man is lifted up in arrogance, and he thinks that he is born free like a wild ass’s colt.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But you have fortified your heart and extended your hands to him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">If you would send away from you the iniquity that is in your hand, and not let injustice remain in your tabernacle,</verse>
  <verse number="15">then you would be able to lift up your face without blemish, and you would be steadfast and unafraid.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Misery, likewise, you would forget, or would remember only like waters that have passed by.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And brightness, like that of midday, will rise upon you until evening, and when you would think yourself consumed, you will rise up like the morning star.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And, when hope has been set before you, you will have faith, and, when buried, you will sleep secure.</verse>
  <verse number="19">You will rest, and there will be nothing to make you afraid, and many will make requests before your face.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But the eyes of the impious will fade away, and the path to escape will perish before them, for the abomination of the soul is their hope.</verse>
