<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah will say to me, If Moses shall stand, and Samuel, before my face, my soul not to this people: casting from my face they shall go forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it was if they shall say to thee, Whither shall we go forth? And say to them, Thus said Jehovah, Whom for death to death; and whom for the sword to the sword; and whom for famine to famine; and whom for captivity to captivity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I reviewed over them four kinds, says Jehovah: the sword to kill, and dogs to tear in pieces, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the earth, to consume and destroy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I gave them for maltreatment to all the kingdoms because of Manasseh, son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for what he did in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For who shall have compassion upon thee, O Jerusalem? and who shall bewail for thee? and who shall turn aside to ask for thy peace?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thou didst reject me, says Jehovah; thou wilt go backward; and I will stretch forth my hand against thee, and I will destroy thee; I was weary of lamenting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I will scatter them with a scattering in the gates of the land; I bereaved of offspring, I destroyed my people; they turned not back from their ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Their widows were many to me above the sand of the seas: I brought to them against the mother a young man laying waste at noon: I caused to fall upon her suddenly wrath and terror.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">She bringing forth seven, languished: she breathed out her soul; her sun went down in the midst of the day: she was ashamed and blushed: and their remainder I will give to the sword before their enemies, says Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Wo to me, my mother, for thou broughtest me forth a man of strife and a man of contention to all the earth. I lent not on interest and they lent not to me on interest: they are altogether cursing me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Jehovah said, If to do well to thy remnant; if not, I caused the enemy in the time of evil and in time of straits to supplicate to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Shall iron break the iron of the north, and brass?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Thy strength and thy treasures I will give for a spoil not for price, and in all thy sins and in all thy bounds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And I caused to pass with thine enemies into a land thou knewest not: for a fire was kindled in my wrath; it shall burn upon you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thou knewest, O Jehovah: remember me, and review me, and avenge for me from him pursuing me; not for being slow of thy wrath wilt thou take me away; know, I suffered reproach for thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Thy words were found, and eating them; and thy word will be to me for the gladness and for the joy of my heart: for thy name was called upon me, Jehovah the God of armies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I sat not in the assembly of those mocking, and I will not exult; from the face of thy hand I sat alone, for thou didst fill me with anger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Wherefore was my pain everlasting and my blow incurable, refusing to be healed? Being, wilt thou be to me as falsehood, the waters were not faithful?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For this, thus said Jehovah, If thou wilt turn back, and I will turn thee back, thou shalt stand before me: and if thou shalt bring forth the precious from the vile thou shalt be as my mouth: they shall turn back to thee and thou shalt not turn back to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And I gave thee to this people for a wall of brass, fortified: and they shall war against thee, and they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, says Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And I delivered thee out of the hand of the evil, and I redeemed thee from the hand of the terrible.</p>
