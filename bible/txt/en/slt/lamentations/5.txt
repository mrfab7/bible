1	Remember, O Jehovah, what was to us: look and see our reproach.
2	Our inheritance was turned to strangers, our houses to foreigners.
3	We were orphans, no father; our mothers as widows.
4	We drank our water for silver; our wood will come for a price.
5	Upon our necks were we pursued: we labored and no rest to us.
6	We gave the hand to Egypt, to Assur, to be filled with bread.
7	Our fathers sinned, they are not; we bore their iniquities.
8	Servants ruled over us: none delivering from their hand.
9	With our souls we shall bring our bread from the face of the sword of the desert.
10	Our skin was scorched as a furnace from the face of the violent heat of famine.
11	They humbled the women in Zion the virgins in the cities of Judah.
12	Chiefs were hung by their hand: the faces of old men were not honored.
13	They took away the chosen ones to grind, and the young men were weak in the wood.
14	Old men ceased from the gate, the chosen ones from their stringed instruments.
15	The joy of our heart ceased; our dance was turned to mourning.
16	The crown of our head fell: wo! now to us, for we sinned.
17	For this our heart was languid; for this our eyes were darkened.
18	For mount Zion was laid waste, the foxes went upon it.
19	Thou, O Jehovah, shalt dwell forever; thy throne to generation and generation.
20	Wherefore wilt thou forget us forever? wilt thou forsake us to length of days?
21	Turn us back, O Jehovah, to thee, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.
22	But rejecting, thou didst reject us; thou wert angry against us even greatly.
