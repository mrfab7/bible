<chapter book="1 Kings" number="6" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">In the four hundred and eightieth year after the Israelites had come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, the second month, he began to build the house of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="2">The house that King Solomon built for the LORD was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The portico at the front of the main hall of the temple was twenty cubits long, extending across the width of the temple and projecting out ten cubits in front of the temple.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He also had narrow windows framed high in the temple.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Against the walls of the temple and the inner sanctuary, Solomon built a chambered structure around the temple, in which he constructed the side rooms.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The bottom floor was five cubits wide, the middle floor six cubits, and the third floor seven cubits. He also placed offset ledges around the outside of the temple, so that nothing would be inserted into its walls.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The temple was constructed using finished stones cut at the quarry, so that no hammer or chisel or any other iron tool was heard in the temple while it was being built.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The entrance to the bottom floor was on the south side of the temple. A stairway led up to the middle level, and from there to the third floor.</verse>
  <verse number="9">So Solomon built the temple and finished it, roofing it with beams and planks of cedar.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He built chambers all along the temple, each five cubits high and attached to the temple with beams of cedar.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="12">“As for this temple you are building, if you walk in My statutes, carry out My ordinances, and keep all My commandments by walking in them, I will fulfill through you the promise I made to your father David.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And I will dwell among the Israelites and will not abandon My people Israel.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">So Solomon built the temple and finished it.</verse>
  <verse number="15">He lined the interior walls with cedar paneling from the floor of the temple to the ceiling, and he covered the floor with cypress boards.</verse>
  <verse number="16">He partitioned off the twenty cubits at the rear of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling to form within the temple an inner sanctuary, the Most Holy Place.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the main hall in front of this room was forty cubits long.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The cedar paneling inside the temple was carved with gourds and open flowers. Everything was cedar; not a stone could be seen.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Solomon also prepared the inner sanctuary within the temple to set the ark of the covenant of the LORD there.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold, and he also overlaid the altar of cedar.</verse>
  <verse number="21">So Solomon overlaid the inside of the temple with pure gold, and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, which was overlaid with gold.</verse>
  <verse number="22">So he overlaid with gold the whole interior of the temple, until everything was completely finished. He also overlaid with gold the entire altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary.</verse>
  <verse number="23">In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim, each ten cubits high, out of olive wood.</verse>
  <verse number="24">One wing of the first cherub was five cubits long, and the other wing was five cubits long as well. So the full wingspan was ten cubits.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The second cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same size and shape,</verse>
  <verse number="26">and the height of each cherub was ten cubits.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple. Since their wings were spread out, the wing of the first cherub touched one wall, while the wing of the second cherub touched the other wall, and in the middle of the room their wingtips touched.</verse>
  <verse number="28">He also overlaid the cherubim with gold.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Then he carved the walls all around the temple, in both the inner and outer sanctuaries, with carved engravings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And he overlaid the temple floor with gold in both the inner and outer sanctuaries.</verse>
  <verse number="31">For the entrance to the inner sanctuary, Solomon constructed doors of olive wood with five-sided doorposts.</verse>
  <verse number="32">The double doors were made of olive wood, and he carved into them cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers and overlaid the cherubim and palm trees with hammered gold.</verse>
  <verse number="33">In the same way he made four-sided doorposts of olive wood for the sanctuary entrance.</verse>
  <verse number="34">The two doors were made of cypress wood, and each had two folding panels.</verse>
  <verse number="35">He carved into them cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, and he overlaid them with gold hammered evenly over the carvings.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Solomon built the inner courtyard with three rows of dressed stone and one row of trimmed cedar beams.</verse>
  <verse number="37">The foundation of the house of the LORD was laid in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign, in the month of Ziv.</verse>
  <verse number="38">In the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, the eighth month, the temple was finished in every detail and according to every specification. So he built the temple in seven years.</verse>
