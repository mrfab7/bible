  <verse number="4">For whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?</verse>
  <verse number="5">The shades tremble beneath the waters and the inhabitants thereof;</verse>
  <verse number="6">Sheol is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He stretcheth out the north over empty space, he hangeth the earth upon nothing;</verse>
  <verse number="8">He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not rent under them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He covereth the face of his throne, he spreadeth his cloud upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He hath traced a fixed circle over the waters, unto the confines of light and darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The pillars of the heavens tremble and are astonished at his rebuke.</verse>
  <verse number="12">He stirreth up the sea by his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through Rahab.</verse>
  <verse number="13">By his Spirit the heavens are adorned; his hand hath formed the fleeing serpent.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Lo, these are the borders of his ways; but what a whisper of a word do we hear of him! And the thunder of his power, who can understand?</verse>
