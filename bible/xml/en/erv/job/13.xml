<chapter book="Job" number="13" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it.</verse>
  <verse number="2">What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Will ye speak unrighteously for God, and talk deceitfully for him?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Will ye respect his person? will ye contend for God?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Is it good that he should search you out? or as one deceiveth a man, will ye deceive him?</verse>
  <verse number="10">He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly respect persons.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Shall not his excellency make you afraid, and his dread fall upon you?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, your defences are defences of clay.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what wilt.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Wherefore should I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Though he slay me, yet will I wait for him: nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">This also shall be my salvation; for a godless man shall not come before him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Hear diligently my speech, and let my declaration be in your ears.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I am righteous.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Who is he that will contend with me? for now shall I hold my peace and give up the ghost.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Only do not two things unto me, then will I not hide myself from thy face:</verse>
  <verse number="21">Withdraw thine hand far from me; and let not thy terror make me afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Then call thou, and I will answer; or let me speak, and answer thou me.</verse>
  <verse number="23">How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?</verse>
  <verse number="25">Wilt thou harass a driven leaf? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?</verse>
  <verse number="26">For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to inherit the iniquities of my youth:</verse>
  <verse number="27">Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and markest all my paths; thou drawest thee a line about the soles of my feet:</verse>
  <verse number="28">Though I am like a rotten thing that consumeth, like a garment that is moth-eaten.</verse>
