  <verse number="1">WHAT advantage then hath the Jew, or what is the profit of circumcision?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Much every way. First indeed, because the words of God were committed to them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For what if some of them have not believed? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But God is true; and every man a liar, as it is written, That thou mayest be justified in thy words, and mayest overcome when thou art judged.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But if our injustice commend the justice of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust, who executeth wrath?</verse>
  <verse number="6">(I speak according to man.) God forbid: otherwise how shall God judge this world?</verse>
  <verse number="7">For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie, unto his glory, why am I also yet judged as a sinner?</verse>
  <verse number="8">And not rather (as we are slandered, and as some affirm that we say) let us do evil, that there may come good? whose damnation is just.</verse>
  <verse number="9">What then? Do we excel them? No, not so. For we have charged both Jews, and Greeks, that they are all under sin.</verse>
  <verse number="10">As it is written: There is not any man just.</verse>
  <verse number="11">There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">All have turned out of the way; they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, there is not so much as one.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have dealt deceitfully. The venom of asps is under their lips.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</verse>
  <verse number="15">Their feet swift to shed blood:</verse>
  <verse number="16">Destruction and misery in their ways:</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the way of peace they have not known:</verse>
  <verse number="18">There is no fear of God before their eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Now we know, that what things soever the law speaketh, it speaketh to them that are in the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be made subject to God.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before him. For by the law is the knowledge of sin.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But now without the law the justice of God is made manifest, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Even the justice of God, by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all them that believe in him: for there is no distinction:</verse>
  <verse number="23">For all have sinned, and do need the glory of God.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption, that is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="25">Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to the shewing of his justice, for the remission of former sins,</verse>
  <verse number="26">Through the forbearance of God, for the shewing of his justice in this time; that he himself may be just, and the justifier of him, who is of the faith of Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Where is then thy boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith.</verse>
  <verse number="28">For we account a man to be justified by faith, without the works of the law.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For it is one God, that justifieth circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Do we, then, destroy the law through faith? God forbid: but we establish the law.</verse>
