<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How long will ye vex my soul and break me in pieces with words?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye deal hardly with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Know now that God hath subverted me in my cause, and hath compassed me with his net.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry for help, but there is no judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and hath set darkness in my paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He hath broken me down on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he plucked up like a tree.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his adversaries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">His troops come on together, and cast up their way against me, and encamp round about my tent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are wholly estranged from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I call unto my servant, and he giveth me no answer, though I entreat him with my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">My breath is strange to my wife, and my supplication to the children of my motherâ€™s womb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Even young children despise me; if I arise, they speak against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">All my inward friends abhor me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were inscribed in a book!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">That with an iron pen and lead they were graven in the rock for ever!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand up at the last upon the earth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And after my skin hath been thus destroyed, yet from my flesh shall I see God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another. My reins are consumed within me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">If ye say, How we will persecute him! seeing that the root of the matter is found in me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.</p>
