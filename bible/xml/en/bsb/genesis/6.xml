<chapter book="Genesis" number="6" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born to them,</verse>
  <verse number="2">the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful, and they took as wives whomever they chose.</verse>
  <verse number="3">So the LORD said, “My Spirit will not contend with man forever, for he is mortal; his days shall be 120 years.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">The Nephilim were on the earth in those days—and afterward as well—when the sons of God had relations with the daughters of men. And they bore them children who became the mighty men of old, men of renown.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then the LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great upon the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was altogether evil all the time.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the LORD regretted that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart.</verse>
  <verse number="7">So the LORD said, “I will blot out man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth—every man and beast and crawling creature and bird of the air—for I am grieved that I have made them.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">Noah, however, found favor in the eyes of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="9">This is the account of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, blameless in his generation; Noah walked with God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Noah had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Now the earth was corrupt in the sight of God, and full of violence.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And God looked upon the earth and saw that it was corrupt; for all living creatures on the earth had corrupted their ways.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then God said to Noah, “The end of all living creatures has come before Me, because through them the earth is full of violence. Now behold, I will destroy both them and the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Make for yourself an ark of gopher wood; make rooms in the ark and coat it with pitch inside and out.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And this is how you are to build it: The ark is to be 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high.</verse>
  <verse number="16">You are to make a roof for the ark, finish its walls a cubit from the top, place a door in the side of the ark, and build lower, middle, and upper decks.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And behold, I will bring floodwaters upon the earth to destroy every creature under the heavens that has the breath of life. Everything on the earth will perish.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But I will establish My covenant with you, and you will enter the ark—you and your sons and your wife and your sons’ wives with you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And you are to bring two of every living creature into the ark—male and female—to keep them alive with you.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Two of every kind of bird and animal and crawling creature will come to you to be kept alive.</verse>
  <verse number="21">You are also to take for yourself every kind of food that is eaten and gather it as food for yourselves and for the animals.”</verse>
  <verse number="22">So Noah did everything precisely as God had commanded him.</verse>
