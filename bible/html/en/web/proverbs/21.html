<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The king’s heart is in Yahweh’s hand like the watercourses. He turns it wherever he desires.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Every way of a man is right in his own eyes, but Yahweh weighs the hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">To do righteousness and justice is more acceptable to Yahweh than sacrifice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A high look, and a proud heart, the lamp of the wicked, is sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The plans of the diligent surely lead to profit; and everyone who is hasty surely rushes to poverty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Getting treasures by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor for those who seek death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The violence of the wicked will drive them away, because they refuse to do what is right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The way of the guilty is devious, but the conduct of the innocent is upright.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than to share a house with a contentious woman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The soul of the wicked desires evil; his neighbor finds no mercy in his eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">When the mocker is punished, the simple gains wisdom. When the wise is instructed, he receives knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked, and brings the wicked to ruin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor, he will also cry out, but shall not be heard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">A gift in secret pacifies anger; and a bribe in the cloak, strong wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">It is joy to the righteous to do justice; but it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The man who wanders out of the way of understanding shall rest in the assembly of the dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He who loves pleasure shall be a poor man. He who loves wine and oil shall not be rich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The wicked is a ransom for the righteous; the treacherous for the upright.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">It is better to dwell in a desert land, than with a contentious and fretful woman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man swallows it up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He who follows after righteousness and kindness finds life, righteousness, and honor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A wise man scales the city of the mighty, and brings down the strength of its confidence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue keeps his soul from troubles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The proud and haughty man, “scoffer” is his name; he works in the arrogance of pride.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The desire of the sluggard kills him, for his hands refuse to labor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">There are those who covet greedily all day long; but the righteous give and don’t withhold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination: how much more, when he brings it with a wicked mind!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A false witness will perish, and a man who listens speaks to eternity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">A wicked man hardens his face; but as for the upright, he establishes his ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The horse is prepared for the day of battle; but victory is with Yahweh.</p>
