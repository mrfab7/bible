<chapter book="1 Timothy" number="4" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now the Spirit has clearly said that, in the end times, some persons will depart from the faith, paying attention to spirits of error and the doctrines of devils,</verse>
  <verse number="2">speaking lies in hypocrisy, and having their consciences seared,</verse>
  <verse number="3">prohibiting marriage, abstaining from foods, which God has created to be accepted with thanksgiving by the faithful and by those who have understood the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected which is received with thanksgiving;</verse>
  <verse number="5">for it has been sanctified by the Word of God and by prayer.</verse>
  <verse number="6">By proposing these things to the brothers, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished by words of faith, and by the good doctrine that you have secured.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But avoid the silly fables of old women. And exercise yourself so as to advance in piety.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For the exercise of the body is somewhat useful. But piety is useful in all things, holding the promise of life, in the present and in the future.</verse>
  <verse number="9">This is a faithful saying and worthy of full acceptance.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For this reason we labor and are maligned: because we hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, most especially of the faithful.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Instruct and teach these things.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Let no one despise your youth, but be an example among the faithful in word, in behavior, in charity, in faith, in chastity.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Until I arrive, attend to reading, to exhortation, and to doctrine.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Do not be willing to neglect the grace that is within you, which was given to you through prophecy, with the imposition of the hands of the priesthood.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Meditate on these things, so that your progress may be manifest to all.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Pay attention to yourself and to doctrine. Pursue these things. For in doing so, you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.</verse>
