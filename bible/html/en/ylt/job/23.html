<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job answereth and saith:—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Also—to-day is my complaint bitter, My hand hath been heavy because of my sighing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">O that I had known—and I find Him, I come in unto His seat,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I arrange before Him the cause, And my mouth fill with arguments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I know the words He doth answer me, And understand what He saith to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In the abundance of power doth He strive with me? No! surely He putteth it in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">There the upright doth reason with Him, And I escape for ever from my judge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Lo, forward I go—and He is not, And backward—and I perceive him not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">To the left in His working—and I see not, He is covered on the right, and I behold not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For He hath known the way with me, He hath tried me—as gold I go forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">On His step hath my foot laid hold, His way I have kept, and turn not aside,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The command of His lips, and I depart not. Above my allotted portion I have laid up The sayings of His mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And He is in one mind, And who doth turn Him back? And His soul hath desired—and He doth it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For He doth complete my portion, And many such things are with Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Therefore, from His presence I am troubled, I consider, and am afraid of Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And God hath made my heart soft, And the Mighty hath troubled me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For I have not been cut off before darkness, And before me He covered thick darkness.</p>
