<chapter book="Isaiah" number="26" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">In that day sung is this song in the land of Judah: ‘We have a strong city, Salvation He doth make walls and bulwark.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Open ye the gates, that enter may a righteous nation, Preserving stedfastness.</verse>
  <verse number="3">An imagination supported Thou fortifiest peace—peace! For in Thee it is confident.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Trust ye in Jehovah for ever, For in Jah Jehovah is a rock of ages,</verse>
  <verse number="5">For He bowed down the dwellers on high, A city set on high He maketh low, He maketh it low unto the earth, He causeth it to come unto the dust,</verse>
  <verse number="6">Tread it down doth a foot, Feet of the poor—steps of the weak.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The path for the righteous is uprightness, O upright One, The path of the righteous Thou dost ponder.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Also, in the path of Thy judgments, O Jehovah, we have waited for Thee, To Thy name and to Thy remembrance Is the desire of the soul.</verse>
  <verse number="9">With my soul I desired Thee in the night, Also, with my spirit within me I seek Thee earnestly, For when Thy judgments are on the earth, The inhabitants of the world have learned righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The wicked findeth favour, He hath not learned righteousness, In a land of straightforwardness he dealeth perversely, And seeth not the excellency of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="11">O Jehovah, high is Thy hand—they see not, They see the zeal of the people, and are ashamed, Also, the fire—Thine adversaries, consumeth them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">O Jehovah, Thou appointest peace to us, For, all our works also Thou hast wrought for us.</verse>
  <verse number="13">O Jehovah our God, lords have ruled us besides Thee, Only, by Thee we make mention of Thy name.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Dead—they live not, Rephaim, they rise not, Therefore Thou hast inspected and dost destroy them, Yea, thou destroyest all their memory.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thou hast added to the nation, O Jehovah, Thou hast added to the nation, Thou hast been honoured, Thou hast put far off all the ends of earth.</verse>
  <verse number="16">O Jehovah, in distress they missed Thee, They have poured out a whisper, Thy chastisement is on them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">When a pregnant woman cometh near to the birth, She is pained—she crieth in her pangs, So we have been from Thy face, O Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="18">We have conceived, we have been pained. We have brought forth as it were wind, Salvation we do not work in the earth, Nor do the inhabitants of the world fall.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Thy dead live—My dead body they rise. Awake and sing, ye dwellers in the dust, For the dew of herbs is thy dew, And the land of Rephaim thou causest to fall.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Come, My people, enter into thy inner chambers, And shut thy doors behind thee, Hide thyself shortly a moment till the indignation pass over.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For, lo, Jehovah is coming out of His place, To charge the iniquity of the inhabitant of the earth upon him, And revealed hath the earth her blood, Nor doth she cover any more her slain!’</verse>
