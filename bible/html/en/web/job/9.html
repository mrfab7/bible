<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Truly I know that it is so, but how can man be just with God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If he is pleased to contend with him, he can’t answer him one time in a thousand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">God who is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who has hardened himself against him, and prospered?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He removes the mountains, and they don’t know it, when he overturns them in his anger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He shakes the earth out of its place. Its pillars tremble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He commands the sun, and it doesn’t rise, and seals up the stars.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He alone stretches out the heavens, and treads on the waves of the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, and the rooms of the south.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He does great things past finding out; yes, marvelous things without number.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Behold, he goes by me, and I don’t see him. He passes on also, but I don’t perceive him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Behold, he snatches away. Who can hinder him? Who will ask him, ‘What are you doing?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">“God will not withdraw his anger. The helpers of Rahab stoop under him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">How much less shall I answer him, And choose my words to argue with him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Though I were righteous, yet I wouldn’t answer him. I would make supplication to my judge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If I had called, and he had answered me, yet I wouldn’t believe that he listened to my voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For he breaks me with a storm, and multiplies my wounds without cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He will not allow me to catch my breath, but fills me with bitterness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If it is a matter of strength, behold, he is mighty! If of justice, ‘Who,’ says he, ‘will summon me?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Though I am righteous, my own mouth shall condemn me. Though I am blameless, it shall prove me perverse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">I am blameless. I don’t respect myself. I despise my life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">“It is all the same. Therefore I say he destroys the blameless and the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If the scourge kills suddenly, he will mock at the trial of the innocent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The earth is given into the hand of the wicked. He covers the faces of its judges. If not he, then who is it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">“Now my days are swifter than a runner. They flee away, they see no good,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">They have passed away as the swift ships, as the eagle that swoops on the prey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face, and cheer up;’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that you will not hold me innocent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">I shall be condemned. Why then do I labor in vain?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">If I wash myself with snow, and cleanse my hands with lye,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">yet you will plunge me in the ditch. My own clothes shall abhor me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, that we should come together in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">There is no umpire between us, that might lay his hand on us both.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Let him take his rod away from me. Let his terror not make me afraid;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">then I would speak, and not fear him, for I am not so in myself.</p>
