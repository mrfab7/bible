<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Eliphaz the Temanite will answer and say,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Trying the word to thee shalt thou be weary? who shall be able to with hold in speaking?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Behold, thou didst instruct many, and thou wilt strengthen the weak hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thy words will raise up the weak and thou wilt strengthen the bent knees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But now it shall come to thee and thou wilt be wearied; it will touch even to thee, and thou wilt tremble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Is not thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the integrity of thy ways?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Remember now, who perished, he being innocent? and where were the upright cut off?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">According to what I saw, they ploughing iniquity and sowing labor shall reap it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">By the breath of God they shall perish, and from the spirit of his anger they shall be finished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the lion, and the teeth of the young lions were broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The lion perished from failure of prey, and the sons of the lioness shall be scattered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And a word shall be brought to me by stealth, and mine ear will take a transient sound from it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">In thoughts, from visions of the night, in the falling of deep sleep upon men,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Fear met me, and trembling, and caused the multitude of my bones to tremble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the spirit will glide before my face; the hair of my flesh will stand erect:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">It will stand, and I shall not recognize its appearance: a form before mine eyes; I shall hear stillness and a voice:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Shall a man be just above God? If a man shall be pure above him making him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Behold, in his servants he will not trust, and upon his messengers he will set folly:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Also those dwelling in houses of clay which their foundation in the dust, being crushed before the moth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">From morning to evening they will be struck; from not setting to superintend they will perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Did not their remainder in them remove? They will die, and not in wisdom.</p>
