1	In many places and in many ways, in past times, God spoke to the fathers through the Prophets;
2	lastly, in these days, he has spoken to us through the Son, whom he appointed as the heir of all things, and through whom he made the world.
3	And since the Son is the brightness of his glory, and the figure of his substance, and is carrying all things by the Word of his virtue, thereby accomplishing a purging of sins, he sits at the right hand of Majesty on high.
4	And having been made so much better than the Angels, he has inherited a name so much greater than theirs.
5	For to which of the Angels has he ever said: “You are my Son; today have I begotten you?” Or again: “I will be a Father to him, and he shall be a Son to me?”
6	And again, when he brings the only-begotten Son into the world, he says: “And let all the Angels of God adore him.”
7	And about the Angels, certainly, he says: “He makes his Angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire.”
8	But about the Son: “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of equity.
9	You have loved justice, and you have hated iniquity. Because of this, God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of exultation, above your companions.”
10	And: “In the beginning, O Lord, you founded the earth. And the heavens are the work of your hands.
11	These shall pass away, but you will remain. And all will grow old like a garment.
12	And you will change them like a cloak, and they shall be changed. Yet you are ever the same, and your years will not diminish.”
13	But to which of the Angels has he ever said: “Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool?”
14	Are they not all spirits of ministration, sent to minister for the sake of those who shall receive the inheritance of salvation?
