<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I saw Jehovah standing upon the altar: and he will say, Strike the crown, and the thresholds shall tremble: and dash them in pieces upon the head of them all; and the last of them I will slay with the sword: the fleeing to them shall not flee, and he escaping to them shall not escape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">If they shall break through into hades, from thence shall my hand take them; and if they shall go up to the heavens, from thence I will bring them down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And if they shall hide in the head of Carmel, from thence will I search and take them; and if they shall be concealed from before mine eyes in the bottom of the sea, from thence I will command the serpent, and he bit them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If they shall go into captivity before the face of their enemies, from thence I will command the sword and it slew them: and I set mine eyes upon them for evil and not for good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the Lord Jehovah of armies touching upon the land, and it shall melt, and all dwelling in it mourned: and it came up as a river all of it, and it was overflowed as the river of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He building his ascents in the heavens, and founding his arches upon the earth; he calling to the waters of the sea, and he will pour them forth upon the face of the earth: Jehovah his name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Are ye not as the sons of the Cushites to me, O sons of Israel? says Jehovah. Did I not bring up Israel out of the land of Egypt? and the rovers from Caphtor, and Aram from Kir?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Behold, the eyes of the Lord Jehovah upon the sinning kingdom, and I destroyed it from the face of the earth; only that destroying, I will not destroy the house of Jacob, says Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For behold, I command, and I caused the house of Israel to move to and fro among all nations as it will move to and fro in a sieve, and a stone shall not fall to the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">By the sword shall all sinning of my people die, saying, It shall not draw near, and the evil shall not cleave about us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">In that day I will raise up the tent of David having fallen, and I walled in their breaches, and I will raise up its destructions, and I built it as the days of old:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">So that they shall possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations which my name was called upon them, says Jehovah doing this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, the ploughing touched upon the harvesting, and the treading of grapes upon the drawing of the seed; and the mountains dropped new wine, and all the hills shall melt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And I turned back the captivity of my people Israel, and they built the cities laid waste, and they inhabited; and they planted vineyards, and they drank their wine; and they made gardens and ate their fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And I planted them upon their land, and they shall no more be plucked up from their land which I gave to them, said Jehovah thy God.</p>
