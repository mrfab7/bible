<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="9" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wisdom hath builded her house; She hath hewn out her seven pillars:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; She hath also furnished her table:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">She hath sent forth her maidens; She crieth upon the highest places of the city:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: As for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Come, eat ye of my bread, And drink of the wine which I have mingled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Leave off, ye simple ones, and live; And walk in the way of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He that correcteth a scoffer getteth to himself reviling; And he that reproveth a wicked man getteth himself a blot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Reprove not a scoffer, lest he hate thee: Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For by me thy days shall be multiplied, And the years of thy life shall be increased.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself; And if thou scoffest, thou alone shalt bear it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The foolish woman is clamorous; She is simple, and knoweth nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And she sitteth at the door of her house, On a seat in the high places of the city,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">To call to them that pass by, Who go right on their ways:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither; And as for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Stolen waters are sweet, And bread eaten in secret is pleasant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But he knoweth not that the dead are there; That her guests are in the depths of Sheol.</p>
