<p class="verse" data-verse="1">What then the superiority of the Jew or what the advantage of circumcision?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Much according to every manner: for truly first were they trusted with the oracles of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For what if some disbelieved? their unbelief will not leave inactive the faith of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">It may not be: and let God be true, and every man a liar; as has been written, That thou mightest be justified in thy words, and mightest conquer in thy being judged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And if our injustice shall recommend the justice of God, what shall we say God not unjust bringing in anger? (I speak as man).</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">It may not be: for how shall God judge the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For if the truth of God in my lying abounded to his glory; why yet am I judged as sinful?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And not, (as we are defamed, and some have declared us to say,) That we should do evil things, that good things might come: whose judgment is just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What advantage therefore have we? Not in any way: for we before accused both Jews and Greeks, all to be under sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">As has been written, That there is no just one, not one:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">There is none understanding, there is none seeking God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">All have bent aside, together have they become unprofitable: there is none doing good, there is not even one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Their throat an opened tomb; with their tongues have they used deceit; the poison of asps under their lips:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Whose mouth is full of cursing and harshness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Their feet active to pour out blood:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Bruising and grievous toil in their ways:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the way of peace they knew not:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The fear of God is not before their eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And we know that whatever says the law, it speaks to them in the law: that every mouth be shut, and all the world be culpable to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Therefore from the works of the law shall no flesh be justified before him: for by the law the knowledge of sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But now without law the justice of God has been made apparent, being testified by the law and by the prophets;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the justice of God by faith of Jesus Christ to all and upon all believing: for there is no distinction:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For all have sinned, and failed of the glory of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Being justified as a gift by his grace by the redemption which is in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Whom God had set before a propitiatory by faith in his blood, for a manifestation of his justice by passing over of sins before existing, in the sufferance of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For the manifestation of his justice now in time: for him to be just, and justifying him of the faith of Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Where then boasting? It was excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">We reckon then man to be justified by faith without the works of the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Or only the God of the Jews? and not also of the nations? Yes, also of the nations:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Since one God, who will justify circumcision of faith, and uncircumcision by faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Therefore shall we leave the law inactive by faith It may not be: but we should establish the law.</p>
