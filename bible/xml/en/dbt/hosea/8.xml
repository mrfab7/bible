  <verse number="1">Set the trumpet to thy mouth. [He cometh] as an eagle against the house of Jehovah, because they have transgressed my covenant, and rebelled against my law.</verse>
  <verse number="2">They shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee; [we], Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Israel hath cast off good: the enemy shall pursue him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">They have set up kings, but not by me; they have made princes, and I knew it not; of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast [thee] off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will they be incapable of purity?</verse>
  <verse number="6">For from Israel is this also:—a workman made it, and it is no God: for the calf of Samaria shall be [broken in] pieces.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk; should it sprout, it would yield no meal; if so be it yield, strangers shall swallow it up.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Israel is swallowed up: now are they become among the nations as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For they are gone up [to] Assyria [as] a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Although they hire among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall begin to be straitened under the burden of the king of princes.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Because Ephraim hath multiplied altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I have prescribed unto him the manifold things of my law: they are counted [as] a strange thing.</verse>
  <verse number="13">They sacrifice flesh [for] the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; Jehovah hath no delight in them. Now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.</verse>
