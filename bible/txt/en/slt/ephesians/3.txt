1	For this, I Paul, the imprisoned of Christ Jesus for you the nations,
2	If ye have heard of the distribution of the grace of God given to me for you:
3	That by revelation he made Known to me the mystery; (as I before wrote briefly,
4	By which ye, reading, can perceive My understanding in the mystery of Christ,)
5	Which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as now has been revealed to his holy sent and to the prophets by the Spirit:
6	For the nations to be co-heirs, and united in one body, and, participators of his solemn promise in Christ by the good news:
7	Of which I Became a servant, according to the gift of the grace of God given to me according to the energy of his power.
8	To me, the least of all the holy ones, was this grace given, to announce the good news in the nations, the untraceable riches of Christ.
9	And to enlighten all what the distribution of the mystery, concealed from times immemorial in God, having created all things by Jesus Christ:
10	That it might now be made known to beginnings and powers in the heavenlies by the church the manifold wisdom of God,
11	According to the purpose of times immemorial which he made in Christ Jesus our Lord:
12	In whom we have freedom of speech and access with confidence by his faith.
13	Wherefore I desire not to lose courage in my pressures for you, which is your glory.
14	For this I bend my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
15	Of whom all the family in the heavens and upon earth is named,
16	That he might give to you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the interior man;
17	For Christ to dwell by faith in your hearts; in love being rendered firm, and the foundation laid,
18	That ye might be fully able to comprehend with all the holy what the length, and breadth, and depth, and height;
19	To know also the love of Christ, surpassing knowledge, that ye might be filled in all the fulness of God.
20	And to him being able to do above all things more abundantly above what we ask or think, according to the power being energetic in us,
21	To him the glory in the church in Christ Jesus to all generations of the times of times. Amen.
