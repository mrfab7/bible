<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The plans of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue is from Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but Yahweh weighs the motives.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Commit your deeds to Yahweh, and your plans shall succeed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Yahweh has made everything for its own end—yes, even the wicked for the day of evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Everyone who is proud in heart is an abomination to Yahweh: they shall certainly not be unpunished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for. By the fear of Yahweh men depart from evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When a man’s ways please Yahweh, he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Better is a little with righteousness, than great revenues with injustice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A man’s heart plans his course, but Yahweh directs his steps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Inspired judgments are on the lips of the king. He shall not betray his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Honest balances and scales are Yahweh’s; all the weights in the bag are his work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">It is an abomination for kings to do wrong, for the throne is established by righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Righteous lips are the delight of kings. They value one who speaks the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The king’s wrath is a messenger of death, but a wise man will pacify it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">In the light of the king’s face is life. His favor is like a cloud of the spring rain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">How much better it is to get wisdom than gold! Yes, to get understanding is to be chosen rather than silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The highway of the upright is to depart from evil. He who keeps his way preserves his soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">It is better to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, than to divide the plunder with the proud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He who heeds the Word finds prosperity. Whoever trusts in Yahweh is blessed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The wise in heart shall be called prudent. Pleasantness of the lips promotes instruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Understanding is a fountain of life to one who has it, but the punishment of fools is their folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The heart of the wise instructs his mouth, and adds learning to his lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Pleasant words are a honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">There is a way which seems right to a man, but in the end it leads to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The appetite of the laboring man labors for him; for his mouth urges him on.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">A worthless man devises mischief. His speech is like a scorching fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A perverse man stirs up strife. A whisperer separates close friends.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">A man of violence entices his neighbor, and leads him in a way that is not good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">One who winks his eyes to plot perversities, one who compresses his lips, is bent on evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Gray hair is a crown of glory. It is attained by a life of righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">One who is slow to anger is better than the mighty; one who rules his spirit, than he who takes a city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from Yahweh.</p>
