  <verse number="1">And Joseph was brought into Egypt, and Putiphar an eunuch of Pharao, chief captain of the army, an Egyptian, bought him of the Ismaelites, by whom he was brought.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the Lord was with him, and he was a prosperous man in all things: and he dwelt in his master’s house,</verse>
  <verse number="3">Who knew very well that the Lord was with him, and made all that he did to prosper in his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Joseph found favour in the sight of his master, and ministered to him: and being set over all by him, he governed the house committed to him, and all things that were delivered to him:</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the Lord blessed the house of the Egyptian for Joseph’s sake, and multiplied all his substance, both at home, and in the fields.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Neither knew he any other thing, but the bread which he ate. And Joseph was of a beautiful countenance, and comely to behold.</verse>
  <verse number="7">h And after many days his mistress ‘cast her eyes on Joseph, and said: Lie with me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But he, in no wise consenting to that wicked act, said to her: Behold, my master hath delivered all things to me, and knoweth not what he hath in his own house:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Neither is there any thing which is hot in my power, or that he hath not delivered to me, but thee, who art his wife : how then can I do this wicked thing, and I sin against my God?</verse>
  <verse number="10">With such words as these day by day, both the woman was importunate with the young man, and he refused the adultery.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Now it happened on it certain day, that Joseph went into the house, and was doing some business without any, man with him:</verse>
  <verse number="12">And she catching the skirt of his garment, said: Lie with me. But he leaving the garment in her hand, fled, and went out.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And when the woman saw the garment in her hands, and herself disregarded,</verse>
  <verse number="14">She called to her the men of her house, and said to them: See, he hath brought in a Hebrew, to abuse us: he came in to me, to lie with me : and when I cried out,</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he heard my voice, he left the garment that I held, and got him out.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For a proof therefore of her fidelity, she kept the garment, and shewed it to her husband when he returned home:</verse>
  <verse number="17">And said: The Hebrew servant, whom thou best brought, came to me to abuse me.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And when he heard me cry, he left the garment which I held, and fled out.</verse>
  <verse number="19">His master hearing these things, and giving too much credit to his wife’s words, was very angry.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And cast Joseph into the prison, where the king’s prisoners were kept, and he was there shut up.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But the Lord was with Joseph and having mercy upon him gave him favour in the sight of the chief keeper of the prison:</verse>
  <verse number="22">Who delivered into his hand all the prisoners that were kept in custody: and whatsoever was done was under him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Neither did he himself know any thing, having committed all things to him: for the Lord was with him, and made all that he did to prosper.</verse>
