<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Good the poor one going in his integrity above the perverse of lips, and he foolish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Also the soul without knowledge is not good, and he hastening with his feat, sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The folly of man will subvert his way: and his heart will be angry against Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Wealth will add many friends; and the poor one will be separated from his neighbor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A witness of falsehoods shall not be unpunished, and he breathing out lies shall not escape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Many will wait for the face of the prince, and every one the friend to the man giving.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All the brethren of the poor hated him: how much more his friends removed far from him? pursuing words they are not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He obtaining a heart loved his soul: he watched understanding to find good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A witness of falsehoods shall not be unpunished, and he breathing out lies shall perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Delight is not becoming to the foolish one; much less for a servant to rule over chiefs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The understanding of man will defer his anger: and his glory to pass over transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The king’s wrath growling as the young lion, and his acceptance as dew upon the grass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A foolish son a calamity to his father: and the strifes of a woman a dropping thrust out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">A house and wealth the inheritance of fathers: and an understanding wife from Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Sloth will cast a deep sleep; and the soul of sloth shall hunger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He watching the command watches his soul: he despising his ways shall die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He pitying the poor lends to Jehovah, and he will recompense to him his act.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Correct thy son when there is hope, and thy soul shall not lift up for his sighing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The stern in wrath lifted up a fine: for if thou shalt deliver and thou shalt yet add.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Hear counsel and receive instruction, so that thou shalt be wise in thy latter state.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Many purposes in a man’s heart: and the counsel of Jehovah, that shall stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The desire of man his mercy: and the poor good above the man of falsehood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The fear of Jehovah is to life: and he being filled shall lodge satisfied; he shall not be reviewed for evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The slothful one hiding his hand in the dish, also he will not turn it back to his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Thou shalt strike him mocking, and the simple will be crafty: and reprove to him understanding, and he will understand knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He oppressing the father and putting the mother to flight, is a son causing shame and causing disgrace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Cease, my son, to hear instructions for erring from the words of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A witness of Belial shall mock judgment: and the mouth of the unjust will swallow down iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Judgment was prepared for those mocking, and blows for the back of the foolish.</p>
