<p class="verse" data-verse="1">These are the generations of the sons of Noe: Sem, Cham, and Japheth: and unto them sons were born after the flood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The sons of Japheth: Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Thubal, and Mosoch, and Thiras.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the sons of Gomer: Ascenez and Riphath and Thogorma.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the sons of Javan: Elisa and Tharsis, Cetthim, and Dodanim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">By these were divided the islands of the Gentiles in their lands, every one according to his tongue and their families in their nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the sons of Cham: Chus, and Mesram, and Phuth, and Chanaan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the sons of Chus: Saba and Hevila, and Sabatha, and Regma, and Sabatacha. The sons of Regma: Saba and Dadan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Now Chus begot Nemrod: he began to be mighty on earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he was a stout hunter before the Lord. Hence came a proverb: Even as Nemrod the stout hunter before the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the beginning of his kingdom was Babylon, and Arach, and Achad, and Chalanne in the land of Sennaar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Out of that land came forth Assur, and built Ninive, and the streets of the city, and Chale.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Resen also between Ninive and Chale: this is the great city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Mesraim begot Ludim, and Anamim, and Laabim, Nepthuim,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Phetrusim, and Chasluim; of whom came forth the Philistines, and the Capthorim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Chanaan begot Sidon, his firstborn, the Hethite,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the Jebusite, and the Amorrhite, and the Gergesite,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The Hevite and the Aracite: the Sinite,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the Aradian, the Samarite, and the Hamathite: and afterwards the families of the Chanaanites were spread abroad.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the limits of Chanaan were from Sidon as one comes to Gerara even to Gaza, until thou enter Sodom and Gomorrha, and Adama, and Seboim even to Lesa.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">These are the children of Cham in their kindreds, and tongues, and generations, and lands, and nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Of Sem also, the father of all children of Heber, the elder brother of Japheth, sons were born.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The sons of Sem: Elam and Assur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The sons of Aram: Us and Hull, and Gether: and Mess.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But Arphaxad begot Sale, of whom was born Heber.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And to Heber were born two sons: the name of the one was Phaleg, because in his days the earth was divided: and his brotherâ€™s name Jectan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Which Jectan begot Elmodad, and Saleph, and Asarmoth, Jare,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And Anduram, and Uzal, and Decla,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And Ebal, and Abimael, Saba,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Ophir, and Hevila, and Jobab.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And their dwelling was from Messa as we go on as far as Sephar, a mountain in the east.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">These are the children of Sem according to their kindreds and tongues, and countries in their nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">These are the families of Noe, according to their peoples and nations. By these were the nations divided on the earth after the flood.</p>
