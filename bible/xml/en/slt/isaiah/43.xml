  <verse number="1">And now, thus said Jehovah creating thee, O Jacob, and forming thee, O Israel, Thou shalt not fear, for I redeemed thee; I called by thy name; thou art to me.</verse>
  <verse number="2">When thou shalt pass through the waters, I with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou shalt go through fire thou shalt not be burnt, and the flame shall not consume thee.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For I Jehovah thy God, the Holy One of Israel, saving thee: I gave Egypt expiating thee, Cush and Seba instead of thee.</verse>
  <verse number="4">From that thou wert precious in mine eyes, thou wert honored, and I loved thee: and I will give man instead of thee, and peoples instead of thy soul.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thou shalt not fear, for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the sunrisings, and from the west I will gather thee.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Say to the north, Thou shalt give, and to the south thou shalt not withhold: bring in my sons from far off, and my daughters from the extremities of the earth;</verse>
  <verse number="7">All being called by name: and I created him; for my glory I formed him; also I made him.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Bring forth the blind people, and there are eyes; and the deaf, and ears to them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Gather all nations together, and people shall be collected: who among them shall announce this, and will they cause us to hear former things? shall they give their witnesses, and be justified? and will they hear, and say, Truth?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Ye my witnesses, says Jehovah, and my servants whom I chose: so that ye shall know and trust to me, and understand that I am he: before me was no God formed, and after me shall be none.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I, I, Jehovah, and none saving besides me.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I announced and I saved, and I caused to hear, and no stranger among you: and ye are witnesses, says Jehovah, and I am God.</verse>

  <verse number="16">Thus said Jehovah giving a way in the sea, and a beaten path in the strong waters;</verse>
  <verse number="17">Bringing forth the chariot and the horse, the strength and the might together, they shall fall down, they shall not rise: they went out; they were quenched as tow.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Will ye not remember the former things? will ye not discern the things of old?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Behold me doing a new thing; now it shall spring forth, shall ye not know it? I will also set a way in the desert, rivers in the waste.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The beast of the field shall know me, the sea monster and the daughters of the ostrich: for I gave waters in the desert, rivers in the waste to give drink to my people, my chosen.</verse>
  <verse number="21">This people I formed for myself; they shall recount my praise.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And thou calledst me not, O Jacob; and thou overt weary of me, O Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Thou broughtest not to me the sheep of thy burnt-offering, and thou honoredst me not with thy sacrifices I caused thee not to serve with a gift, and I wearied thee not with frankincense.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Thou broughtest not for me a buying with silver, thou didst not satiate me with the fat of thy sacrifices also thou causedst me to serve with thy sins, thou didst weary me with thine iniquities.</verse>
  <verse number="25">I, I am he wiping away thy transgressions for my sake, and I will not remember thy sins.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Cause me to remember; we will judge together; relate thou so that thou shalt be justified.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Thy first father sinned, thy interpreter transgressed against me.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And will defile the chiefs of the holy place, and will give Jacob to be devoted, and Israel for reproaches.</verse>
