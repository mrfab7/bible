<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, don’t forget my teaching; but let your heart keep my commandments:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">for length of days, and years of life, and peace, will they add to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Don’t let kindness and truth forsake you. Bind them around your neck. Write them on the tablet of your heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">So you will find favor, and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, and don’t lean on your own understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Don’t be wise in your own eyes. Fear Yahweh, and depart from evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">It will be health to your body, and nourishment to your bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Honor Yahweh with your substance, with the first fruits of all your increase:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">so your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My son, don’t despise Yahweh’s discipline, neither be weary of his reproof:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">for whom Yahweh loves, he reproves; even as a father reproves the son in whom he delights.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Happy is the man who finds wisdom, the man who gets understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For her good profit is better than getting silver, and her return is better than fine gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">She is more precious than rubies. None of the things you can desire are to be compared to her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Length of days is in her right hand. In her left hand are riches and honor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Her ways are ways of pleasantness. All her paths are peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her. Happy is everyone who retains her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">By wisdom Yahweh founded the earth. By understanding, he established the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">By his knowledge, the depths were broken up, and the skies drop down the dew.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">My son, let them not depart from your eyes. Keep sound wisdom and discretion:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">so they will be life to your soul, and grace for your neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Then you shall walk in your way securely. Your foot won’t stumble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">When you lie down, you will not be afraid. Yes, you will lie down, and your sleep will be sweet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Don’t be afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">for Yahweh will be your confidence, and will keep your foot from being taken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Don’t withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Don’t say to your neighbor, “Go, and come again; tomorrow I will give it to you,” when you have it by you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Don’t devise evil against your neighbor, since he dwells securely by you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Don’t strive with a man without cause, if he has done you no harm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Don’t envy the man of violence. Choose none of his ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For the perverse is an abomination to Yahweh, but his friendship is with the upright.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Yahweh’s curse is in the house of the wicked, but he blesses the habitation of the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Surely he mocks the mockers, but he gives grace to the humble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">The wise will inherit glory, but shame will be the promotion of fools.</p>
