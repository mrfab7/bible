<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Without the veil of the testimony, in the tent of meeting, shall Aaron keep it in order from evening to morning before Jehovah continually: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He shall keep in order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before Jehovah continually.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth parts of an ephah shall be in one cake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Every sabbath day he shall set it in order before Jehovah continually; it is on the behalf of the children of Israel, an everlasting covenant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And it shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of Jehovah made by fire by a perpetual statute.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and the son of the Israelitish woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him unto Moses. And his motherâ€™s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And they put him in ward, that it might be declared unto them at the mouth of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he that blasphemeth the name of Jehovah, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the sojourner, as the home-born, when he blasphemeth the name of Jehovah, shall be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he that smiteth any man mortally shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good, life for life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbor; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be rendered unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And he that killeth a beast shall make it good: and he that killeth a man shall be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the sojourner, as for the home-born: for I am Jehovah your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Moses spake to the children of Israel; and they brought forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. And the children of Israel did as Jehovah commanded Moses.</p>
