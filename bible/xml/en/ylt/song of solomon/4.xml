<chapter book="Song of Solomon" number="4" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Lo, thou art fair, my friend, lo, thou art fair, Thine eyes are doves behind thy veil, Thy hair as a row of the goats That have shone from mount Gilead,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thy teeth as a row of the shorn ones That have come up from the washing, For all of them are forming twins, And a bereaved one is not among them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">As a thread of scarlet are thy lips, And thy speech is comely, As the work of the pomegranate is thy temple behind thy veil,</verse>
  <verse number="4">As the tower of David is thy neck, built for an armoury, The chief of the shields are hung on it, All shields of the mighty.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thy two breasts are as two fawns, Twins of a roe, that are feeding among lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Till the day doth break forth, And the shadows have fled away, I will get me unto the mountain of myrrh, And unto the hill of frankincense.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thou art all fair, my friend, And a blemish there is not in thee. Come from Lebanon, O spouse,</verse>
  <verse number="8">Come from Lebanon, come thou in. Look from the top of Amana, From the top of Shenir and Hermon, From the habitations of lions, From the mountains of leopards.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Thou hast emboldened me, my sister-spouse, Emboldened me with one of thine eyes, With one chain of thy neck.</verse>
  <verse number="10">How wonderful have been thy loves, my sister-spouse, How much better have been thy loves than wine, And the fragrance of thy perfumes than all spices.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Thy lips drop honey, O spouse, Honey and milk are under thy tongue, And the fragrance of thy garments Is as the fragrance of Lebanon.</verse>
  <verse number="12">A garden shut up is my sister-spouse, A spring shut up—a fountain sealed.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Thy shoots a paradise of pomegranates, With precious fruits,</verse>
  <verse number="14">Cypresses with nard—nard and saffron, Cane and cinnamon, With all trees of frankincense, Myrrh and aloes, with all chief spices.</verse>
  <verse number="15">A fount of gardens, a well of living waters, And flowings from Lebanon!</verse>
  <verse number="16">Awake, O north wind, and come, O south, Cause my garden to breathe forth, its spices let flow, Let my beloved come to his garden, And eat its pleasant fruits!</verse>
