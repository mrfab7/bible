<div class="chapter" data-book="Philippians" data-chapter="1" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus that are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers with me of grace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">so that ye may approve the things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and void of offence unto the day of Christ;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now I would have you know, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the progress of the gospel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">so that my bonds became manifest in Christ throughout the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and that most of the brethren in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">the one do it of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">but the other proclaim Christ of faction, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">What then? only that in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and therein I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For I know that this shall turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be put to shame, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But if to live in the flesh,â€”if this shall bring fruit from my work, then what I shall choose I know not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But I am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, yea, and abide with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you or be absent, I may hear of your state, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your salvation, and that from God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</p>
