  <verse number="2">Be instant in prayer; watching in it with thanksgiving:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Praying withal for us also, that God may open unto us a door of speech to speak the mystery of Christ (for which also I am bound;)</verse>
  <verse number="4">That I may make it manifest as I ought to speak.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Walk with wisdom towards them that are without, redeeming the time.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Let your speech be always in grace seasoned with salt: that you may know how you ought to answer every man.</verse>
  <verse number="7">All the things that concern me, Tychicus, our dearest brother, and faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord, will make known to you,</verse>
  <verse number="8">Whom I have sent to you for this same purpose, that he may know the things that concern you, and comfort your hearts,</verse>
  <verse number="9">With Onesimus, a most beloved and faithful brother, who is one of you. All things that are done here, they shall make known to you.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, saluteth you, and Mark, the cousin german of Barnabus, touching whom you have received commandments; if he come unto you, receive him:</verse>

  <verse number="14">Luke, the most dear physician, saluteth you: and Demas.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Salute the brethren who are at Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church that is in his house.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And when this epistle shall have been read with you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans: and that you read that which is of the Laodiceans.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And say to Archippus: Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.</verse>
