<div class="chapter" data-book="Hosea" data-chapter="4" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Hear the word of the LORD, you children of Israel: for the LORD has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood touches blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwells therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yes, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for your people are as they that strive with the priest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Therefore shall you fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with you in the night, and I will destroy your mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you, that you shall be no priest to me: seeing you have forgotten the law of your God, I will also forget your children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit prostitution, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Prostitution and wine and new wine take away the heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declares to them: for the spirit of prostitutions has caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They sacrifice on the tops of the mountains, and burn incense on the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit prostitution, and your spouses shall commit adultery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I will not punish your daughters when they commit prostitution, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that does not understand shall fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Though you, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not you to Gilgal, neither go you up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD lives.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For Israel slides back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Their drink is sour: they have committed prostitution continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The wind has bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.</p>
