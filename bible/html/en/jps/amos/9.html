<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I saw the Lord standing beside the altar; and He said: Smite the capitals, that the posts may shake; And break them in pieces on the head of all of them; And I will slay the residue of them with the sword; There shall not one of them flee away, And there shall not one of them escape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Though they dig into the nether-world, Thence shall My hand take them; And though they climb up to heaven, Thence will I bring them down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out thence; And though they be hid from My sight in the bottom of the sea, Thence will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And though they go into captivity before their enemies, Thence will I command the sword, and it shall slay them; And I will set Mine eyes upon them For evil, and not for good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For the Lord, the GOD of hosts, Is He that toucheth the land and it melteth, And all that dwell therein mourn; And it riseth up wholly like the River, And sinketh again, like the River of Egypt;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">It is He that buildeth His upper chambers in the heaven, And hath founded His vault upon the earth; He that calleth for the waters of the sea, And poureth them out upon the face of the earth; The LORD is His name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians unto Me, O children of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, And the Philistines from Caphtor, And Aram from Kir?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD Are upon the sinful kingdom, And I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; Saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, Saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, Like as corn is sifted in a sieve, Yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">All the sinners of My people shall die by the sword, That say: ‘The evil shall not overtake nor confront us.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">In that day will I raise up The tabernacle of David that is fallen, And close up the breaches thereof, And I will raise up his ruins, And I will build it as in the days of old;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">That they may possess the remnant of Edom, And all the nations, upon whom My name is called, Saith the LORD that doeth this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, That the plowman shall overtake the reaper, And the treader of grapes him that soweth seed; And the mountains shall drop sweet wine, And all the hills shall melt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And I will turn the captivity of My people Israel, And they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; And they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; They shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And I will plant them upon their land, And they shall no more be plucked up Out of their land which I have given them, Saith the LORD thy God.</p>
