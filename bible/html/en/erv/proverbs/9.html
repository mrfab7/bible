<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">She hath sent forth her maidens, she crieth upon the highest places of the city,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Come, eat ye of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Leave off, ye simple ones, and live; and walk in the way of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He that correcteth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that reproveth a wicked man getteth himself a blot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: reprove a wise man, and he will love thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself: and if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The foolish woman is clamorous; she is simple, and knoweth nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">To call to them that pass by, who go right on their ways,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But he knoweth not that the dead are there; that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.</p>
