<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son makes a glad father: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivers from death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casts away the substance of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He becomes poor that deals with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent makes rich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He that gathers in summer is a wise son: but he that sleeps in harvest is a son that causes shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Blessings are on the head of the just: but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He that walks uprightly walks surely: but he that perverts his ways shall be known.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He that winks with the eye causes sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence covers the mouth of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Hatred stirs up strifes: but love covers all sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">In the lips of him that has understanding wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The rich manâ€™s wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The labor of the righteous tends to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He is in the way of life that keeps instruction: but he that refuses reproof errs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He that hides hatred with lying lips, and he that utters a slander, is a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">In the multitude of words there wants not sin: but he that refrains his lips is wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The blessing of the LORD, it makes rich, and he adds no sorrow with it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding has wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The fear of the wicked, it shall come on him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">As the whirlwind passes, so is the wicked no more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The fear of the LORD prolongs days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The mouth of the just brings forth wisdom: but the fraudulent tongue shall be cut out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaks frowardness.</p>
