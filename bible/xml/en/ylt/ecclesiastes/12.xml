<chapter book="Ecclesiastes" number="12" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Remember also thy Creators in days of thy youth, While that the evil days come not, Nor the years have arrived, that thou sayest, ‘I have no pleasure in them.’</verse>
  <verse number="2">While that the sun is not darkened, and the light, And the moon, and the stars, And the thick clouds returned after the rain.</verse>
  <verse number="3">In the day that keepers of the house tremble, And men of strength have bowed themselves, And grinders have ceased, because they have become few. And those looking out at the windows have become dim,</verse>
  <verse number="4">And doors have been shut in the street. When the noise of the grinding is low, And one riseth at the voice of the bird, And all daughters of song are bowed down.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Also of that which is high they are afraid, And of the low places in the way, And the almond-tree is despised, And the grasshopper is become a burden, And want is increased, For man is going unto his home age-during, And the mourners have gone round through the street.</verse>
  <verse number="6">While that the silver cord is not removed, And the golden bowl broken, And the pitcher broken by the fountain, And the wheel broken at the well.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the dust returneth to the earth as it was, And the spirit returneth to God who gave it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Vanity of vanities, said the preacher, the whole is vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And further, because the preacher was wise, he still taught the people knowledge, and gave ear, and sought out—he made right many similes.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The preacher sought to find out pleasing words, and, written by the upright, words of truth.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Words of the wise are as goads, and as fences planted by the masters of collections, they have been given by one shepherd.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And further, from these, my son, be warned; the making of many books hath no end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The end of the whole matter let us hear:—‘Fear God, and keep His commands, for this is the whole of man.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For every work doth God bring into judgment, with every hidden thing, whether good or bad.’</verse>
