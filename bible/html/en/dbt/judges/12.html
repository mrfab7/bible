<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the men of Ephraim were called together, and passed over northwards, and said to Jephthah, Why didst thou pass over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? We will burn thy house upon thee with fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Jephthah said to them, I was at great strife, I and my people, with the children of Ammon; and I called you, but ye saved me not out of their hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And when I saw that ye would not save me, I put my life in my hand, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Jehovah gave them into my hand. Why then are ye come up to me this day, to fight against me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye, Gilead, ye are fugitives of Ephraim in the midst of Ephraim, [and] in the midst of Manasseh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Gilead took the fords of the Jordan before Ephraim; and it came to pass that when the fugitives of Ephraim said, Let me go over, the men of Gilead said to him, Art thou an Ephraimite? and he said, No.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then they said to him, Say now Shibboleth! and he said, Sibboleth, and did not manage to pronounce [it] rightly. Then they took him, and slaughtered him at the fords of the Jordan. And there fell at that time of Ephraim forty-two thousand.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Ibzan died, and was buried at Bethlehem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And after him Elon, the Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, the Pirathonite, judged Israel.</p>
