  <verse number="1">For the law having a shadow of good things about to be, not the same image of the things, with these sacrifices which they bring in yearly in continuance never can render perfect them coming thereto.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For would they not have ceased to be brought in? because they serving have no more consciousness of sins, once purified.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But in these, a reminding of sins yearly.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For the blood of bulls and he-goats cannot take away sins.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Wherefore coming into the world, he says, Sacrifice and offering then wouldest not, but a body hast thou adjusted to me:</verse>
  <verse number="6">And with whole burnt offering for sin wast thou not contented.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then said I, Behold, I am here (in the head of the book it was written of me,) O God, to do thy will.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Farther back, saying, That sacrifice and bringing in and whole burnt offerings and for sin thou wouldest not, neither wert contented with; which are brought in according to law;</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then he said, Behold, I am here to do, O God, thy will. He takes away the first, that he might set up the second.</verse>
  <verse number="10">In which will we are consecrated by the bringing in of the body of Jesus Christ once.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And truly every priest has stood daily, serving and bringing in many times the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:</verse>
  <verse number="12">But this, having brought in one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down on the right hand of God;</verse>
  <verse number="13">As to the rest, awaiting till his enemies be put a footstool of his feet.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For by one offering has he perfected forever the consecrated.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And also the Holy Spirit testifies to us: for after having said before,</verse>
  <verse number="16">This the covenant which I will establish with them after those days, says the Lord, giving my laws upon their heart, and upon their minds will I write them;</verse>
  <verse number="17">And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And where remission of these, no more bringing in for sin.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Having therefore, brethren, freedom of speech for the entering in of the holies by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="20">A way publicly declared and living, which he consecrated to us, through the veil, that is, his flesh;</verse>
  <verse number="21">And a great priest over the house of God;</verse>
  <verse number="22">Let us approach with a true heart in complete certainty of faith, having our hearts be sprinkled from an evil consciousness, and having our bodies washed with pure water.</verse>
  <verse number="23">We should hold the assent of hope not bending; (for faithful he having promised;)</verse>
  <verse number="24">And we should observe one another for the incitement of love and good works:</verse>
  <verse number="25">Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom to some; but beseeching: and by so much the more, inasmuch as ye see the day drawing near.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For we sinning voluntarily after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there is left no more a sacrifice for sins,</verse>
  <verse number="27">But a certain terrible expectation of judgment and jealousy of fire, being about to devour the adversaries.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Any one having rejected Moses’ law, without compassion dies by two or three witnesses:</verse>
  <verse number="29">Of how much worse punishment, think ye, shall he be deemed worthy, having trodden down the Son of God, and deemed the blood of the covenant common, in which he was consecrated, and having outraged the Spirit of grace?</verse>
  <verse number="30">For we know him having said, Vengeance to me, I will give back, says the Lord. And again, The Lord will judge his people.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Terrible to fall into the hands of the living God.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And recall to mind the former days, in which, having been enlightened, ye endured a great combat of sufferings;</verse>
  <verse number="33">This, truly, being exposed to public view both by reproaches and pressures; and this, having been partakers of those thus overturned.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For ye also suffered together with me in bonds, and received the pillage of your possessions with joy, knowing to have in yourselves a better and abiding substance in the heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Throw not away therefore your freedom of speech, which has great payment of reward.</verse>
  <verse number="36">For ye have need of patience, that, having done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For yet a little while only, he coming will come, and will not tarry.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And the just one shall live by faith; but if he draw down, my soul is not contented in him.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And we are not of drawing down to perdition; but of faith to the acquisition of the soul.</verse>
