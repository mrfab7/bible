<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover Elihu answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thinkest thou this to be thy right, or sayest thou, My righteousness is more than Godâ€™s,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the skies, which are higher than thou.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If thou hast sinned, what doest thou against him? and if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit a son of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; they cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But none saith, Where is God my Maker, who giveth songs in the night;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">How much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not, the cause is before him, and thou waitest for him!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, neither doth he greatly regard arrogance;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity; he multiplieth words without knowledge.</p>
