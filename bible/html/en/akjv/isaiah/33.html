<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="33" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Woe to you that spoil, and you were not spoiled; and deal treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with you! when you shall cease to spoil, you shall be spoiled; and when you shall make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">O LORD, be gracious to us; we have waited for you: be you their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of yourself the nations were scattered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpillar: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run on them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The LORD is exalted; for he dwells on high: he has filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of your times, and strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his treasure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceases: he has broken the covenant, he has despised the cities, he regards no man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The earth mourns and languishes: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Now will I rise, said the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">You shall conceive chaff, you shall bring forth stubble: your breath, as fire, shall devour you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hear, you that are far off, what I have done; and, you that are near, acknowledge my might.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness has surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He that walks righteously, and speaks uprightly; he that despises the gain of oppressions, that shakes his hands from holding of bribes, that stops his ears from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes from seeing evil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He shall dwell on high: his place of defense shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Your eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Your heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where is the receiver? where is he that counted the towers?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">You shall not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than you can perceive; of a stammering tongue, that you can not understand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Look on Zion, the city of our solemnities: your eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But there the glorious LORD will be to us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; he will save us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Your tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.</p>
