<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Let not your heart be troubled: you believe in God, believe also in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to myself; that where I am, there you may be also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And where I go you know, and the way you know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thomas said to him, Lord, we know not where you go; and how can we know the way?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Jesus said to him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man comes to the Father, but by me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If you had known me, you should have known my Father also: and from now on you know him, and have seen him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffises us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Jesus said to him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet have you not known me, Philip? he that has seen me has seen the Father; and how say you then, Show us the Father?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak to you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwells in me, he does the works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works’ sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Truly, truly, I say to you, He that believes on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go to my Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And whatever you shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If you shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If you love me, keep my commandments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it sees him not, neither knows him: but you know him; for he dwells with you, and shall be in you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more; but you see me: because I live, you shall live also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">At that day you shall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He that has my commandments, and keeps them, he it is that loves me: and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Judas said to him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us, and not to the world?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Jesus answered and said to him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and make our stayed with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He that loves me not keeps not my sayings: and the word which you hear is not mine, but the Father’s which sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">These things have I spoken to you, being yet present with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you: not as the world gives, give I to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">You have heard how I said to you, I go away, and come again to you. If you loved me, you would rejoice, because I said, I go to the Father: for my Father is greater than I.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, you might believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world comes, and has nothing in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence.</p>
