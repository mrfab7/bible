  <verse number="4">And they destroyed the walls of Tyre, and pulled down her towers and I swept away her dust from her, and I gave her for a dry rock.</verse>
  <verse number="5">It shall be for spreading nets in the midst of the sea: for I spake, says the Lord Jehovah: and it was for a spoil to the nations.</verse>
  <verse number="6">An her daughters who are in the field, shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that am Jehovah.</verse>

  <verse number="8">Thy daughters in the field he shall slay with the sword: and he gave a watch-tower against thee, and he threw up a mound against thee, and lifted up the buckler against thee.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he will give the stroke of his front against thy walls, and with his sword he will tear down thy towers.</verse>
  <verse number="10">From the abundance of is horses, their dust will cover thee: from the voice of the horseman, and the wheel, and the chariot, thy walls shall shake, in his coming in to thy gates, as the enterings of a city rent asunder.</verse>

  <verse number="12">And they spoiled thy strength and they plundered thy traffic, and they pulled down thy walls, and they will tear down thy houses of desire, and they will set thy stones and thy woods and thy dust in the midst of the water.</verse>

  <verse number="16">And all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and they removed their robes, and they shall put off the garments of variegations: they shall put on tremblings; they sat upon the earth and trembled at the moments, and were astonished at thee.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And they lifted up for thee a lamentation, and they said to thee, How wert thou destroyed being inhabited from the seas, the celebrated city which was strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants who gave their terrors to all her inhabitants.</verse>

  <verse number="20">And brought thee down with them going down to the pit to the people of old, and I set thee in the earth, underneath in desolations from forever with them going down to the pit, so that thou shalt not be inhabited; and I gave glory in the land of the living.</verse>
  <verse number="21">I will give thee for terrors, and not thee: and thou shalt be sought and shalt not be found any more forever, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
