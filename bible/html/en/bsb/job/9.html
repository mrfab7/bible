<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Yes, I know that it is so, but how can a mortal be righteous before God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If one wished to contend with God, he could not answer Him one time out of a thousand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">God is wise in heart and mighty in strength. Who has resisted Him and prospered?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He moves mountains without their knowledge and overturns them in His anger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He shakes the earth from its place, so that its foundations tremble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He commands the sun not to shine; He seals off the stars.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He is the Maker of the Bear and Orion, of the Pleiades and the constellations of the south.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He does great things beyond searching out, and wonders without number.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Were He to pass by me, I would not see Him; were He to move, I would not recognize Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If He takes away, who can stop Him? Who dares to ask Him, ‘What are You doing?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">God does not restrain His anger; the helpers of Rahab cower beneath Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">How then can I answer Him or choose my arguments against Him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For even if I were right, I could not answer. I could only beg my Judge for mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If I summoned Him and He answered me, I do not believe He would listen to my voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For He would crush me with a tempest and multiply my wounds without cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He does not let me catch my breath, but overwhelms me with bitterness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If it is a matter of strength, He is indeed mighty! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon Him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Even if I were righteous, my mouth would condemn me; if I were blameless, it would declare me guilty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Though I am blameless, I have no concern for myself; I despise my own life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">It is all the same, and so I say, ‘He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">When the scourge brings sudden death, He mocks the despair of the innocent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He blindfolds its judges. If it is not He, then who is it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">My days are swifter than a runner; they flee without seeing good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">They sweep by like boats of papyrus, like an eagle swooping down on its prey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">If I were to say, ‘I will forget my complaint and change my expression and smile,’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">I would still dread all my sufferings; I know that You will not acquit me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Since I am already found guilty, why should I labor in vain?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">If I should wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">then You would plunge me into the pit, and even my own clothes would despise me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For He is not a man like me, that I can answer Him, that we can take each other to court.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Nor is there a mediator between us, to lay his hand upon us both.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Let Him remove His rod from me, so that His terror will no longer frighten me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Then I would speak without fear of Him. But as it is, I am on my own.</p>
