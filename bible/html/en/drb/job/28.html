<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="28" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Silver hath beginnings of its veins, and gold hath a place wherein it is melted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Iron is taken out of the earth, and stone melted with heat is turned into brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He hath set a time for darkness, and the end of all things he considereth, the stone also that is in the dark and the shadow of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The flood divideth from the people that are on their journey, those whom the food of the needy man hath forgotten, and who cannot be come at.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The land, out of which bread grew in its place, hath been overturned with fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The stones of it are the place of sapphires, and the clods of it are gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The bird hath not known the path, neither hath the eye of the vulture beheld it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The children of the merchants have not trodden it, neither hath the lioness passed by it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He hath stretched forth his hand to the flint, he hath overturned mountains from the roots.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">In the rocks he hath cut out rivers, and his eye hath seen every precious thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The depths also of rivers he hath searched, and hidden things he hath brought forth to light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But where is wisdom to be found, and where is the place of understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Man knoweth not the price thereof, neither is it found in the land of them that live in delights.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The depth saith: It is not in me: and the sea saith: It is not with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The finest gold shall not purchase it, neither shall silver be weighed in exchange for it</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">It shall not be compared with the dyed colours of India, or with the most precious stone sardonyx, or the sapphire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Gold or crystal cannot equal it, neither shall any vessels of gold be changed for it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">High and eminent things shall not be mentioned in comparison of it: but wisdom is drawn out of secret places.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The topaz of Ethiopia shall not be equal to it, neither shall it be compared to the cleanest dyeing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">It is hid from the eyes of all living. and the fowls of the air know it not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Destruction and death have said: With our ears we have heard the fame thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">God understandeth the way of it, and he knoweth the place thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For he beholdeth the ends of the world: and looketh on all things that are under heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Who made a weight for the winds and weighed the waters by measure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">When he gave a law for the rain, and a way for the sounding storms.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Then he saw it, and declared, and prepared, and searched it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And he said to man: Behold the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom: and to depart from evil, is understanding.</p>
