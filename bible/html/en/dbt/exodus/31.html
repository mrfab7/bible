<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in every work,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">to devise artistic work—to work in gold, and in silver, and in copper,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and in cutting of stones, for setting, and for carving of timber—to work in all manner of work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of every one that is wise-hearted have I given wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded thee—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">the tent of meeting and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy-seat that is thereupon, and all the utensils of the tent,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">and the table and its utensils, and the pure lamp-stand and all its utensils, and the altar of incense;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and the altar of burnt-offering and all its utensils, and the laver and its stand;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and the garments of service, both the holy garments of Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to serve as priests;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and the anointing oil, and the incense of fragrant drugs for the sanctuary: according to all that I have commanded thee shall they do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And thou, speak thou unto the children of Israel, saying, Surely my sabbaths shall ye keep; for this is a sign between me and you throughout your generations, that ye may know that it is I, Jehovah, who do hallow you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Keep the sabbath, therefore; for it is holy unto you; every one that profaneth it shall certainly be put to death: yea, whoever doeth work on it, that soul shall be cut off from among his peoples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, holy to Jehovah: whoever doeth work on the sabbath day shall certainly be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations—[it is] an everlasting covenant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">It shall be a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever; for [in] six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he gave to Moses, when he had ended speaking with him on mount Sinai, the two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.</p>
