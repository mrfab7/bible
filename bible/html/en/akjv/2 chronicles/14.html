<p class="verse" data-verse="1">So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land was quiet ten years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and broke down the images, and cut down the groves:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Therefore he said to Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he has given us rest on every side. So they built and prospered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Asa had an army of men that bore targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came to Mareshah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Asa cried to the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with you to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on you, and in your name we go against this multitude. O LORD, you are our God; let no man prevail against you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them to Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came on them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.</p>
