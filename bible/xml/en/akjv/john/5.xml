  <verse number="1">After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</verse>
  <verse number="3">In these lay a great multitude of weak folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatever disease he had.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</verse>
  <verse number="6">When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he said to him, Will you be made whole?</verse>
  <verse number="7">The weak man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steps down before me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Jesus said to him, Rise, take up your bed, and walk.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The Jews therefore said to him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said to me, Take up your bed, and walk.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Then asked they him, What man is that which said to you, Take up your bed, and walk?</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he that was healed knew not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Afterward Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, you are made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come to you.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But Jesus answered them, My Father works till now, and I work.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Then answered Jesus and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, these also does the Son likewise.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that himself does: and he will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For as the Father raises up the dead, and vivifies them; even so the Son vivifies whom he will.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son:</verse>
  <verse number="23">That all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honors not the Son honors not the Father which has sent him.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Truly, truly, I say to you, He that hears my word, and believes on him that sent me, has everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death to life.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Truly, truly, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself;</verse>
  <verse number="27">And has given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</verse>
  <verse number="29">And shall come forth; they that have done good, to the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of damnation.</verse>
  <verse number="30">I can of my own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father which has sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="31">If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</verse>
  <verse number="32">There is another that bears witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.</verse>
  <verse number="33">You sent to John, and he bore witness to the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="34">But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that you might be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="35">He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</verse>
  <verse number="36">But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And the Father himself, which has sent me, has borne witness of me. You have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he has sent, him you believe not.</verse>
  <verse number="39">Search the scriptures; for in them you think you have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And you will not come to me, that you might have life.</verse>
  <verse number="41">I receive not honor from men.</verse>
  <verse number="42">But I know you, that you have not the love of God in you.</verse>
  <verse number="43">I am come in my Father’s name, and you receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive.</verse>
  <verse number="44">How can you believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that comes from God only?</verse>
  <verse number="45">Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust.</verse>
  <verse number="46">For had you believed Moses, you would have believed me; for he wrote of me.</verse>
  <verse number="47">But if you believe not his writings, how shall you believe my words?</verse>
