<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="24" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Do not imitate evil men, nor desire to be among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For their mind meditates on robberies, and their lips speak deceptions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">By wisdom shall a house be built, and by prudence shall it be strengthened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">By doctrine, the storerooms shall be filled with every substance that is precious and most beautiful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A wise man is strong, and a well-taught man is robust and valiant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For war is undertaken in an orderly manner, and safety shall be where there are many counsels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wisdom is beyond the foolish; at the gate he will not open his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Whoever intends to do evil shall be called foolish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The intention of the foolish is sin. And the detractor is an abomination among men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If you despair, being weary in the day of anguish, your strength will be diminished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Rescue those who are led away to death. And do not cease from delivering those who are dragged away to a violent death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If you would say: “I do not have sufficient strength.” He who inspects the heart, the same one understands, and nothing slips past the one who preserves your soul. And he shall repay a man according to his works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">My son, eat honey, because it is good, and the honeycomb, because it is so sweet to your throat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">So, too, is the doctrine of wisdom to your soul. When you have found it, you will have hope in the end, and your hope shall not perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Do not lie in wait, and do not seek impiety in the house of the just, nor spoil his rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For the just one will fall seven times, and he shall rise again. But the impious will fall into evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">When your enemy will fall, do not be glad, and do not let your heart exult in his ruin,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">lest perhaps the Lord see, and it displease him, and he may take away his wrath from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Do not contend with the most wicked, and do not be a rival to the impious.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For the evil hold no hope in the future, and the lamp of the impious will be extinguished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">My son, fear the Lord, as well as the king. And do not mingle with detractors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For their perdition shall up rise suddenly. And who knows what ruin will be for each of them?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Likewise, these things are for the wise. It is not good to base judgment on knowledge of character.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Those who say to the impious, “You are just,” shall be cursed by the people, and the tribes shall detest them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Those who argue against the impious shall be praised, and a blessing shall come upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He shall kiss the lips, who responds with upright words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Prepare your outdoor work, and diligently cultivate your field, so that afterward, you may build your house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Do not be a witness without cause against your neighbor. And do not mislead anyone with your lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Do not say, “I will do to him as he has done to me.” I will repay each one according to his work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">I passed by the field of a lazy man, and by the vineyard of a foolish man,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">and behold, it was entirely filled with nettles, and thorns had covered its surface, and the stonewall was destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">When I had seen this, I laid it up in my heart, and by this example, I received discipline.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">You will sleep a little,” I said. “You will slumber briefly. You will fold your hands a little, so as to rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And destitution will overtake you like a runner, and begging will overtake you like an armed man.”</p>
