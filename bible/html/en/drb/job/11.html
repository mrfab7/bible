<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Sophar the Naamathite answered, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Shall not he that speaketh much, hear also? or shall a man full of talk be justified?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Shall men hold their peace to thee only? and when thou hast mocked others, shall no man confute thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For thou hast said: My word is pure, and I am clean in thy sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And I wish that God would speak with thee, and would open his lips to thee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">That he might shew thee the secrets of wisdom, and that his law is manifold, and thou mightest understand that he exacteth much less of thee, than thy iniquity deserveth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Peradventure thou wilt comprehend the steps of God, and wilt find out the Almighty perfectly?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He is higher than heaven, and what wilt thou do ? he is deeper than hell, and how wilt thou know?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The measure of him is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If he shall overturn all things, or shall press them together, who shall contradict him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For he knoweth the vanity of men, and when he seeth iniquity, doth he not consider it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A vain man is lifted up into pride, and thinketh himself born free like a wild assâ€™s colt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Rut thou hast hardened thy heart, and hast spread thy hands to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If thou wilt put away from thee the iniquity that is in thy hand, and lot not injustice remain in thy tabernacle:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Then mayst thou lift up thy face without spot, and thou shalt be steadfast, and shalt not fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Thou shalt also forget misery, and remember it only as waters that are passed away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And brightness like that of the noonday, shall arise to thee at evening: and when thou shalt think thyself consumed, thou shalt rise as the day star.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And thou shalt have confidence, hope being set before thee, and being buried thou shalt sleep secure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thou shalt rest, and there shall be none to make thee afraid: and many shall entreat thy face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But the eyes of the wicked shall decay, and the way to escape shall fail them, and their hope the abomination of the soul.</p>
