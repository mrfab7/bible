<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="13" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">If I were to speak in the language of men, or of Angels, yet not have charity, I would be like a clanging bell or a crashing cymbal.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And if I have prophecy, and learn every mystery, and obtain all knowledge, and possess all faith, so that I could move mountains, yet not have charity, then I am nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And if I distribute all my goods in order to feed the poor, and if I hand over my body to be burned, yet not have charity, it offers me nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Charity is patient, is kind. Charity does not envy, does not act wrongly, is not inflated.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Charity is not ambitious, does not seek for itself, is not provoked to anger, devises no evil.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Charity does not rejoice over iniquity, but rejoices in truth.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Charity suffers all, believes all, hopes all, endures all.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Charity is never torn away, even if prophecies pass away, or languages cease, or knowledge is destroyed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For we know only in part, and we prophesy only in part.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But when the perfect arrives, the imperfect passes away.</verse>
  <verse number="11">When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I understood like a child, I thought like a child. But when I became a man, I put aside the things of a child.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now we see through a glass darkly. But then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know, even as I am known.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But for now, these three continue: faith, hope, and charity. And the greatest of these is charity.</verse>
