<p class="verse" data-verse="1">‘And God speaketh all these words, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I am Jehovah thy God, who hath brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of a house of servants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">‘Thou hast no other Gods before Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thou dost not make to thyself a graven image, or any likeness which is in the heavens above, or which is in the earth beneath, or which is in the waters under the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thou dost not bow thyself to them, nor serve them: for I, Jehovah thy God, am a zealous God, charging iniquity of fathers on sons, on the third generation, and on the fourth, of those hating Me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and doing kindness to thousands, of those loving Me and keeping My commands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">‘Thou dost not take up the name of Jehovah thy God for a vain thing, for Jehovah acquitteth not him who taketh up His name for a vain thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">‘Remember the Sabbath-day to sanctify it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">six days thou dost labour, and hast done all thy work,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and the seventh day is a Sabbath to Jehovah thy God; thou dost not do any work, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant, and thy handmaid, and thy cattle, and thy sojourner who is within thy gates,—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">for six days hath Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and resteth in the seventh day; therefore hath Jehovah blessed the Sabbath-day, and doth sanctify it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">‘Honour thy father and thy mother, so that thy days are prolonged on the ground which Jehovah thy God is giving to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">‘Thou dost not murder.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">‘Thou dost not commit adultery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">‘Thou dost not steal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">‘Thou dost not answer against thy neighbour a false testimony.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Thou dost not desire the house of thy neighbour, thou dost not desire the wife of thy neighbour, or his man-servant, or his handmaid, or his ox, or his ass, or anything which is thy neighbour’s.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And all the people are seeing the voices, and the flames, and the sound of the trumpet, and the mount smoking; and the people see, and move, and stand afar off,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and say unto Moses, ‘Speak thou with us, and we hear, and let not God speak with us, lest we die.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Moses saith unto the people, ‘Fear not, for to try you hath God come, and in order that His fear may be before your faces—that ye sin not.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the people stand afar off, and Moses hath drawn nigh unto the thick darkness where God is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Jehovah saith unto Moses, ‘Thus dost thou say unto the sons of Israel: Ye—ye have seen that from the heavens I have spoken with you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">ye do not make with Me gods of silver, even gods of gold ye do not make to yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">‘An altar of earth thou dost make for Me, and thou hast sacrificed on it thy burnt-offerings and thy peace-offerings, thy flock and thy herd; in every place where I cause My name to be remembered I come in unto thee, and have blessed thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">‘And if an altar of stones thou dost make to Me, thou dost not build them of hewn work; when thy tool thou hast waved over it, then thou dost pollute it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">neither dost thou go up by steps on Mine altar, that thy nakedness be not revealed upon it.</p>
