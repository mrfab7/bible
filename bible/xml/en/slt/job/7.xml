<chapter book="Job" number="7" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Is there not warfare to man upon the earth, and his days as the days of a hireling?</verse>
  <verse number="2">As the servant will gape for the shadow, and as the hireling will wait for his work:</verse>
  <verse number="3">So was I caused to possess to me months of vanity, and nights of toil were allotted to me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">If I lay down, and I said, When shall I arise, and the evening be measured? And I was filled with tossings even to the twilight.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And my flesh was clothed with worms, and a clod of dust; my akin was contracted and melted away.</verse>
  <verse number="6">My days were swift above a weaver’s shuttle, and will finish with no more of hope.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Remember that my life is wind: mine eyes shall not turn back to see good.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The eye of him seeing me shall not look after me: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The cloud will end and will go away: thus he shall go down to hades and shall not come up.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He shall turn back no more to his house, and his place shall know him no more.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Also I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the straitness of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Am I the sea, or a dragon, that thou wilt set a watch over me?</verse>
  <verse number="13">For I said, My bed shall comfort me; my couch shall lift up in my complaint;</verse>
  <verse number="14">And thou didst terrify me with dreams, and thou wilt make me afraid with visions:</verse>
  <verse number="15">And my soul will choose strangling; death rather than my bones.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I melted away; I shall not live forever: desist from me, for my days are vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="17">What is man that thou wilt magnify him? and that thou wilt set thy heart to him?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And thou wilt review him for the mornings, and thou wilt try him for the moments.</verse>
  <verse number="19">How long wilt thou not look away from me? wilt thou not desist from me even to my swallowing down my spittle?</verse>
  <verse number="20">I sinned; what shall I do to thee, guarding men? wherefore didst thou set me for an assault to thee, and I shall be upon myself for a burden?</verse>
  <verse number="21">And why wilt thou not lift up my transgression and pass over mine iniquity? for now I shall lie down to the dust; and thou soughtest me and I was not.</verse>
