<div class="chapter" data-book="Philippians" data-chapter="2" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">If, then, any exhortation is in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">fulfil ye my joy, that ye may mind the same thing—having the same love—of one soul—minding the one thing,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">nothing in rivalry or vain-glory, but in humility of mind one another counting more excellent than yourselves—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">each not to your own look ye, but each also to the things of others.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For, let this mind be in you that is also in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal to God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">but did empty himself, the form of a servant having taken, in the likeness of men having been made,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">and in fashion having been found as a man, he humbled himself, having become obedient unto death—death even of a cross,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">wherefore, also, God did highly exalt him, and gave to him a name that is above every name,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">that in the name of Jesus every knee may bow—of heavenlies, and earthlies, and what are under the earth—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and every tongue may confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">So that, my beloved, as ye always obey, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, with fear and trembling your own salvation work out,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">for God it is who is working in you both to will and to work for His good pleasure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">All things do without murmurings and reasonings,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God, unblemished in the midst of a generation crooked and perverse, among whom ye do appear as luminaries in the world,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">the word of life holding forth, for rejoicing to me in regard to a day of Christ, that not in vain did I run, nor in vain did I labour;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">but if also I am poured forth upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and joy with you all,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">because of this do ye also rejoice and joy with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And I hope, in the Lord Jesus, Timotheus to send quickly to you, that I also may be of good spirit, having known the things concerning you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">for I have no one like-minded, who sincerely for the things concerning you will care,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">for the whole seek their own things, not the things of the Christ Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">and the proof of him ye know, that as a child serveth a father, with me he did serve in regard to the good news;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">him, indeed, therefore, I hope to send, when I may see through the things concerning me—immediately;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">and I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall quickly come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And I thought it necessary Epaphroditus—my brother, and fellow-workman, and fellow-soldier, and your apostle and servant to my need—to send unto you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">seeing he was longing after you all, and in heaviness, because ye heard that he ailed,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">for he also ailed nigh to death, but God did deal kindly with him, and not with him only, but also with me, that sorrow upon sorrow I might not have.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The more eagerly, therefore, I did send him, that having seen him again ye may rejoice, and I may be the less sorrowful;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">receive him, therefore, in the Lord, with all joy, and hold such in honour,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">because on account of the work of the Christ he drew near to death, having hazarded the life that he might fill up your deficiency of service unto me.</p>
