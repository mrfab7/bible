<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But he answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For God commanded, saying, Honor your father and mother: and, He that curses father or mother, let him die the death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But you say, Whoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatever you might be profited by me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And honor not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have you made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">You hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">This people draws near to me with their mouth, and honors me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he called the multitude, and said to them, Hear, and understand:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Not that which goes into the mouth defiles a man; but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles a man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Then came his disciples, and said to him, Know you that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Then answered Peter and said to him, Declare to us this parable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Jesus said, Are you also yet without understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Do not you yet understand, that whatever enters in at the mouth goes into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashed hands defiles not a man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Then Jesus went there, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried to him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, you son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and sought him, saying, Send her away; for she cries after us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But he answered and said, I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it to dogs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith: be it to you even as you will. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Jesus departed from there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And great multitudes came to him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">So that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Then Jesus called his disciples to him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And his disciples say to him, From where should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And Jesus said to them, How many loaves have you? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and broke them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.</p>
