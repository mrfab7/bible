  <verse number="1">After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Job spoke, and said:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Let the day perish wherein I was born, And the night wherein it was said: ‘A man-child is brought forth.’</verse>
  <verse number="4">Let that day be darkness; Let not God inquire after it from above, Neither let the light shine upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own; Let a cloud dwell upon it; Let all that maketh black the day terrify it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it; Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Lo, let that night be desolate; Let no joyful voice come therein.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Let them curse it that curse the day, Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; Let it look for light, but have none; Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning;</verse>
  <verse number="10">Because it shut not up the doors of my [mother’s] womb, Nor hid trouble from mine eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not perish at birth?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Why did the knees receive me? And wherefore the breasts, that I should suck?</verse>
  <verse number="13">For now should I have lain still and been quiet; I should have slept; then had I been at rest—</verse>
  <verse number="14">With kings and counsellors of the earth, Who built up waste places for themselves;</verse>
  <verse number="15">Or with princes that had gold, Who filled their houses with silver;</verse>
  <verse number="16">Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been; As infants that never saw light.</verse>
  <verse number="17">There the wicked cease from troubling; And there the weary are at rest.</verse>
  <verse number="18">There the prisoners are at ease together; They hear not the voice of the taskmaster.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The small and great are there alike; And the servant is free from his master.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Wherewith is light given to him that is in misery, And life unto the bitter in soul—</verse>
  <verse number="21">Who long for death, but it cometh not; And dig for it more than for hid treasures;</verse>
  <verse number="22">Who rejoice unto exultation, And are glad, when they can find the grave?—</verse>
  <verse number="23">To a man whose way is hid, And whom God hath hedged in?</verse>
  <verse number="24">For my sighing cometh instead of my food, And my roarings are poured out like water.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For the thing which I did fear is come upon me, And that which I was afraid of hath overtaken me.</verse>
  <verse number="26">I was not at ease, neither was I quiet, Neither had I rest; but trouble came.</verse>
