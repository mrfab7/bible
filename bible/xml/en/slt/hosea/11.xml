<chapter book="Hosea" number="11" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">When Israel was a child, and I loved him, and I called for my son out of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="2">They called to them, thus they went from them: they will sacrifice to the Baals, and to the carved images they will burn incense.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I taught Ephraim to walk, taking them by their arms; and they knew not that I healed them.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I will draw them with the cords of man, with the bands of love: and I will be to them as those lifting up the yoke upon their jaw-bones, and I will gently give them to eat.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He shall not turn back to the land of Egypt, and Assur shall be his king, for they refused to turn back.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the sword was polished in his cities, and it consumed his branches, and devoured from their counsels.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And my people are bent to turning away from me: and they will call together to the Most High; he will not exalt them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">How shall I give thee up, O Ephraim? Shall I deliver thee over, O Israel? How shall I give thee as the earth? Shall I set thee as roes? My heart was turned upon me; my grievings were kindled together.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I will not do the burning of mine anger, I will not turn back to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not a man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not come into the city.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They shall go after Jehovah: as a lion shall he roar: for he shall roar, and the sons of the waters shall tremble.</verse>
  <verse number="11">They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assur: and I caused them to dwell in their houses, says Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Ephraim surrounded me with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit: and Judah even ruled with God, and was faithful with the holy ones.</verse>
