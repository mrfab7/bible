<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, an apostle, (not from men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, to another gospel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Which is not another; but there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach any other gospel to you than that which we have preached to you, let him be accursed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">As we said before, so I say now again, If any man preacheth any other gospel to you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For I neither received it from man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews’ religion, that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And profited in the Jews’ religion above many my equals in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me by his grace,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Neither did I go to Jerusalem to them who were apostles before me: but I went into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then after three years I went to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But I saw no other of the apostles, save James the Lord’s brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which were in Christ:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But they had heard only, That he who persecuted us in times past, now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And they glorified God in me.</p>
