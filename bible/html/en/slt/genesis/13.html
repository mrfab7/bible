<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Abram shall go up from Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that is to him, and Lot with him, to the desert.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Abram was very abundant in cattle, in silver and in gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Abram shall go his journey from the desert to the house of God to the place which was there his tent in the beginning, between Bethel and between Hai;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To the place of the altar which he made there in the beginning; and there he will call on the name of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And to Lot also going with Abram, were sheep and oxen and tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the land supported them not to dwell together, for their acquisition was a multitude, and they were not able to dwell together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And there shall be a strife between the shepherds of Abram’s cattle, and between the shepherds of Lot’s cattle; and the Canaanite and the Perizzite then dwelt in the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Abram will say to Lot, Now there shall not be strife between me and between thee, and between my shepherds and between thy shepherds, for we are men brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Is not all the land before thy face? Now be separated from me; if to the left hand, I will go to the right; and if to the right hand, I will go to the left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Lot will lift his eyes and will see all the environs of Jordan, that all was watered, before that Jehovah destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, as the garden of Jehovah as the land of Egypt in thy coming to Zoar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Lot shall choose to him all the environs of Jordan: and Lot will remove from the east and they shall be separated each from his brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Abram shall dwell in the land of Canaan, and Lot shall dwell in the cities of the country round about, and will pitch the tent at Sodom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the men of Sodom were evil and sinful before Jehovah exceedingly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Jehovah said to Abram after Lot separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes and see from the place which thou art there to the north and the desert, and the east and the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And I made thy seed as the dust of the earth, that if a man shall be able to reckon up the dust of the earth, thy seed also shall be reckoned up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Arise to walk in the land according to its length and according to its breadth; for to thee will I give it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Abram will pitch his tent, and will come and will dwell by the oaks of Mamra which is in Hebron, and he will build there an altar to Jehovah.</p>
