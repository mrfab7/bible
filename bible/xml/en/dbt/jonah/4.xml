  <verse number="1">And it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he prayed unto Jehovah, and said, Ah, Jehovah, was not this my saying when I was yet in my country? Therefore I was minded to flee at first unto Tarshish; for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great loving-kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And now, Jehovah, take, I beseech thee, my life from me, for it is better for me to die than to live.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Jehovah said, Doest thou well to be angry?</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shade, till he might see what would become of the city.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Jehovah Elohim prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shade over his head, to deliver him from his trouble. And Jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, so that he fainted; and he requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, unto death.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Jehovah said, Thou hast pity on the gourd, for which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:</verse>
  <verse number="11">and I, should not I have pity on Nineveh, the great city, wherein are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?</verse>
