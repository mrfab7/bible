  <verse number="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Speak to the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers’ house, of all their princes according to their fathers’ houses, twelve rods: write every man’s name on his rod.</verse>
  <verse number="3">You shall write Aaron’s name on the rod of Levi; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers’ houses.</verse>
  <verse number="4">You shall lay them up in the Tent of Meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">It shall happen, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers’ houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Moses laid up the rods before Yahweh in the tent of the testimony.</verse>
  <verse number="8">It happened on the next day, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Moses brought out all the rods from before Yahweh to all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.</verse>
