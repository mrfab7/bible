  <verse number="1">My son, if thou wilt receive my words, And lay up my commandments with thee;</verse>
  <verse number="2">So as to incline thine ear unto wisdom, And apply thy heart to understanding;</verse>
  <verse number="3">Yea, if thou cry after discernment, And lift up thy voice for understanding;</verse>
  <verse number="4">If thou seek her as silver, And search for her as for hid treasures:</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, And find the knowledge of God.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For Jehovah giveth wisdom; Out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding:</verse>
  <verse number="7">He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to them that walk in integrity;</verse>
  <verse number="8">That he may guard the paths of justice, And preserve the way of his saints.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice, And equity, yea, every good path.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For wisdom shall enter into thy heart, And knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul;</verse>
  <verse number="11">Discretion shall watch over thee; Understanding shall keep thee:</verse>
  <verse number="12">To deliver thee from the way of evil, From the men that speak perverse things;</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who forsake the paths of uprightness, To walk in the ways of darkness;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Who rejoice to do evil, And delight in the perverseness of evil;</verse>
  <verse number="15">Who are crooked in their ways, And wayward in their paths:</verse>
  <verse number="16">To deliver thee from the strange woman, Even from the foreigner that flattereth with her words;</verse>
  <verse number="17">That forsaketh the friend of her youth, And forgetteth the covenant of her God:</verse>
  <verse number="18">For her house inclineth unto death, And her paths unto the dead;</verse>
  <verse number="19">None that go unto her return again, Neither do they attain unto the paths of life:</verse>
  <verse number="20">That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, And keep the paths of the righteous.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For the upright shall dwell in the land, And the perfect shall remain in it.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, And the treacherous shall be rooted out of it.</verse>
