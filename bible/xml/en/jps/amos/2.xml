  <verse number="1">Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Moab, Yea, for four, I will not reverse it: Because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime.</verse>
  <verse number="2">So will I send a fire upon Moab, And it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth; And Moab shall die with tumult, With shouting, and with the sound of the horn;</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, And will slay all the princes thereof with him, Saith the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Judah, Yea, for four, I will not reverse it: Because they have rejected the law of the LORD, And have not kept His statutes, And their lies have caused them to err, After which their fathers did walk.</verse>
  <verse number="5">So will I send a fire upon Judah, And it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Israel, Yea, for four, I will not reverse it: Because they sell the righteous for silver, And the needy for a pair of shoes;</verse>
  <verse number="7">That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, And turn aside the way of the humble; And a man and his father go unto the same maid, To profane My holy name;</verse>
  <verse number="8">And they lay themselves down beside every altar Upon clothes taken in pledge, And in the house of their God they drink The wine of them that have been fined.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, Whose height was like the height of the cedars, And he was strong as the oaks; Yet I destroyed his fruit from above, And his roots from beneath.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, And led you forty years in the wilderness, To possess the land of the Amorites.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And I raised up of your sons for prophets, And of your young men for Nazirites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? Saith the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But ye gave the Nazirites wine to drink; And commanded the prophets, saying: ‘Prophesy not.’</verse>
  <verse number="13">Behold, I will make it creak under you, As a cart creaketh that is full of sheaves.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And flight shall fail the swift, And the strong shall not exert his strength, Neither shall the mighty deliver himself;</verse>
  <verse number="15">Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; And he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself; Neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself;</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he that is courageous among the mighty Shall flee away naked in that day, Saith the LORD.</verse>
