<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl in your miseries, which shall come upon you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Your riches are corrupted: and your garments are motheaten.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Your gold and silver is cankered: and the rust of them shall be for a testimony against you, and shall eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up to yourselves wrath against the last days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Behold the hire of the labourers, who have reaped down your fields, which by fraud has been kept back by you, crieth: and the cry of them hath entered into the ears of the Lord of sabaoth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">You have feasted upon earth: and in riotousness you have nourished your hearts, in the day of slaughter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">You have condemned and put to death the Just One, and he resisted you not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Be patient therefore, brethren, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth: patiently bearing till he receive the early and latter rain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Be you therefore also patient, and strengthen your hearts: for the coming of the Lord is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Grudge not, brethren, one against another, that you may not be judged. Behold the judge standeth before the door.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Take, my brethren, for an example of suffering evil, of labour and patience, the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Behold, we account them blessed who have endured. You have heard of the patience of Job, and you have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is merciful and compassionate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by heaven, nor by the earth, nor by any other oath. But let your speech be, yea, yea: no, no: that you fall not under judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Is any of you sad? Let him pray. Is he cheerful in mind? Let him sing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Is any man sick among you? Let him bring in the priests of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the prayer of faith shall save the sick man: and the Lord shall raise him up: and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Confess therefore your sins one to another: and pray one for another, that you may be saved. For the continual prayer of a just man availeth much.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Elias was a man passible like unto us: and with prayer he prayed that it might not rain upon the earth, and it rained not for three years and six months.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he prayed again: and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">My brethren, if any of you err from the truth, and one convert him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He must know that he who causeth a sinner to be converted from the error of his way, shall save his soul from death, and shall cover a multitude of sins.</p>
