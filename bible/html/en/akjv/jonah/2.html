<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God out of the fishâ€™s belly,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And said, I cried by reason of my affliction to the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and you heard my voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For you had cast me into the deep, in the middle of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all your billows and your waves passed over me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Then I said, I am cast out of your sight; yet I will look again toward your holy temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet have you brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in to you, into your holy temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But I will sacrifice to you with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the LORD spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah on the dry land.</p>
