<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And after these things, having left Athens, he came to Corinth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and finding a certain Jew by name Aquila, of Pontus by race, just come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife, (because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome,) came to them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and because they were of the same trade abode with them, and wrought. For they were tent-makers by trade.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And when both Silas and Timotheus came down from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in respect of the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But as they opposed and spoke injuriously, he shook his clothes, and said to them, Your blood be upon your own head: I [am] pure; from henceforth I will go to the nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And departing thence he came to the house of a certain [man], by name Justus, who worshipped God, whose house adjoined the synagogue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But Crispus the ruler of the synagogue believed in the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing, believed, and were baptised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the Lord said by vision in [the] night to Paul, Fear not, but speak and be not silent;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">because I am with thee, and no one shall set upon thee to injure thee; because I have much people in this city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And he remained [there] a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one consent rose against Paul and led him to the judgment-seat,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">saying, This [man] persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But as Paul was going to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If indeed it was some wrong or wicked criminality, O Jews, of reason I should have borne with you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">but if it be questions about words, and names, and the law that ye have, see to it yourselves; [for] I do not intend to be judge of these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he drove them from the judgment-seat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And having all laid hold on Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue, they beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio troubled himself about none of these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Paul, having yet stayed [there] many days, took leave of the brethren and sailed thence to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and he arrived at Ephesus, and left them there. But entering himself into the synagogue he reasoned with the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And when they asked him that he would remain for a longer time [with them] he did not accede,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">but bade them farewell, saying, [I must by all means keep the coming feast at Jerusalem]; I will return to you again, if God will: and he sailed away from Ephesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And landing at Caesarea, and having gone up and saluted the assembly, he went down to Antioch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And having stayed [there] some time, he went forth, passing in order through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, establishing all the disciples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by race, an eloquent man, who was mighty in the scriptures, arrived at Ephesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in his spirit, he spoke and taught exactly the things concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla, having heard him, took him to [them] and unfolded to him the way of God more exactly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And when he purposed to go into Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples engaging them to receive him, who, being come, contributed much to those who believed through grace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For he with great force convinced the Jews publicly, shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</p>
