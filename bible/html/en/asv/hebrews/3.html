<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, even Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also was Moses in all his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For he hath been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he that built the house hath more honor than the house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For every house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">but Christ as a son, over his house; whose house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of our hope firm unto the end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wherefore, even as the Holy Spirit saith, To-day if ye shall hear his voice,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Where your fathers tried me by proving me, And saw my works forty years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Wherefore I was displeased with this generation, And said, They do always err in their heart: But they did not know my ways;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">As I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Take heed, brethren, lest haply there shall be in any one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the living God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">but exhort one another day by day, so long as it is called To-day; lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">for we are become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm unto the end:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">while it is said, To-day if ye shall hear his voice, Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For who, when they heard, did provoke? nay, did not all they that came out of Egypt by Moses?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And with whom was he displeased forty years? was it not with them that sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that were disobedient?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.</p>
