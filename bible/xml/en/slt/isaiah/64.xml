  <verse number="1">Would that thou didst rend the heavens; thou camest down; the mountains flowed from before thee.</verse>
  <verse number="2">As the fire of meltings was kindled the fire will cause the water to boil, to cause thy name to be known to thine adversaries; from thy face shall the nations be moved.</verse>
  <verse number="3">In thy doing wonderful things we shall not expect, thou camest down, the mountains flowed from before thee.</verse>
  <verse number="4">From forever they heard not, they gave not ear, the eye saw not, O God, besides thee, he will do to him waiting for him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thou mettest him rejoicing and doing justice, they shall remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou wert angry; and we shall sin in them of old, and we shall be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And we were all as the unclean, and all our justice as the garment of monthly courses; and we shall all fail away as the leaf; and our iniquities as the wind will take us away.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And none calling upon thy name, none rousing himself to take hold upon thee: for thou hiddest thy face from us, and thou wilt melt us by the hand of our iniquities.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And now, O Jehovah, thou our Father; we the clay and thou forming us; and we all the work of thy hand.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Thou wilt not be angry, O Jehovah, even greatly, and not forever wilt thou remember iniquity: behold, look now, Ye are all thy people.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The cities of thy holy place were desert; Zion was a desert, Jerusalem a desolation.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The house of our holy place and our glory where our fathers praised thee, was for a burning of fire, and all our precious things were for desolation.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For these wilt thou refrain thyself, O Jehovah? wilt thou be silent, and wilt thou humble us even greatly?</verse>
