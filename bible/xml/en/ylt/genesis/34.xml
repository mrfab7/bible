  <verse number="1">And Dinah, daughter of Leah, whom she hath borne to Jacob, goeth out to look on the daughters of the land,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and Shechem, son of Hamor the Hivite, a prince of the land, seeth her, and taketh her, and lieth with her, and humbleth her;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and his soul cleaveth to Dinah, daughter of Jacob, and he loveth the young person, and speaketh unto the heart of the young person.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Shechem speaketh unto Hamor his father, saying, ‘Take for me this damsel for a wife.’</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Jacob hath heard that he hath defiled Dinah his daughter, and his sons were with his cattle in the field, and Jacob kept silent till their coming.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Hamor, father of Shechem, goeth out unto Jacob to speak with him;</verse>
  <verse number="7">and the sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard, and the men grieve themselves, and it is very displeasing to them, for folly he hath done against Israel, to lie with the daughter of Jacob—and so it is not done.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Hamor speaketh with them, saying, ‘Shechem, my son, his soul hath cleaved to your daughter; give her, I pray you, to him for a wife,</verse>
  <verse number="9">and join ye in marriage with us; your daughters ye give to us, and our daughters ye take to yourselves,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and with us ye dwell, and the land is before you; dwell ye and trade in it, and have possessions in it.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Shechem saith unto her father, and unto her brethren, ‘Let me find grace in your eyes, and that which ye say unto me, I give;</verse>
  <verse number="12">multiply on me exceedingly dowry and gift, and I give as ye say unto me, and give to me the young person for a wife.’</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the sons of Jacob answer Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, and they speak (because he defiled Dinah their sister),</verse>
  <verse number="14">and say unto them, ‘We are not able to do this thing, to give our sister to one who hath a foreskin: for it is a reproach to us.</verse>
  <verse number="15">‘Only for this we consent to you; if ye be as we, to have every male of you circumcised,</verse>
  <verse number="16">then we have given our daughters to you, and your daughters we take to ourselves, and we have dwelt with you, and have become one people;</verse>
  <verse number="17">and if ye hearken not unto us to be circumcised, then we have taken our daughter, and have gone.’</verse>
  <verse number="18">And their words are good in the eyes of Hamor, and in the eyes of Shechem, Hamor’s son;</verse>
  <verse number="19">and the young man delayed not to do the thing, for he had delight in Jacob’s daughter, and he is honourable above all the house of his father.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Hamor cometh—Shechem his son also—unto the gate of their city, and they speak unto the men of their city, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="21">These men are peaceable with us; then let them dwell in the land, and trade in it; and the land, lo, is wide before them; their daughters let us take to ourselves for wives, and our daughters give to them.</verse>
  <verse number="22">‘Only for this do the men consent to us, to dwell with us, to become one people, in every male of us being circumcised, as they are circumcised;</verse>
  <verse number="23">their cattle, and their substance, and all their beasts—are they not ours? only let us consent to them, and they dwell with us.’</verse>
  <verse number="24">And unto Hamor, and unto Shechem his son, hearken do all those going out of the gate of his city, and every male is circumcised, all those going out of the gate of his city.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And it cometh to pass, on the third day, in their being pained, that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, take each his sword, and come in against the city confidently, and slay every male;</verse>
  <verse number="26">and Hamor, and Shechem his son, they have slain by the mouth of the sword, and they take Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and go out.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Jacob’s sons have come in upon the wounded, and they spoil the city, because they had defiled their sister;</verse>
  <verse number="28">their flock and their herd, and their asses, and that which is in the city, and that which is in the field, have they taken;</verse>
  <verse number="29">and all their wealth, and all their infants, and their wives they have taken captive, and they spoil also all that is in the house.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And Jacob saith unto Simeon and unto Levi, ‘Ye have troubled me, by causing me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanite, and among the Perizzite: and I am few in number, and they have been gathered against me, and have smitten me, and I have been destroyed, I and my house.’</verse>
  <verse number="31">And they say, ‘As a harlot doth he make our sister?’</verse>
