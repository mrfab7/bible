  <verse number="1">Moreover Elihu answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thinkest thou this to be thy right, or sayest thou, My righteousness is more than God’s,</verse>
  <verse number="3">That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?</verse>
  <verse number="4">I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the skies, which are higher than thou.</verse>
  <verse number="6">If thou hast sinned, what doest thou against him? and if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit a son of man.</verse>
  <verse number="9">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; they cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But none saith, Where is God my Maker, who giveth songs in the night;</verse>
  <verse number="11">Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?</verse>
  <verse number="12">There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</verse>
  <verse number="14">How much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not, the cause is before him, and thou waitest for him!</verse>
  <verse number="15">But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, neither doth he greatly regard arrogance;</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity; he multiplieth words without knowledge.</verse>
