<div class="chapter" data-book="Philemon" data-chapter="1" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, a brother, to Philemon, our beloved fellow laborer,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and to Apphia, most beloved sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the church which is in your house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Grace and peace to you, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I give thanks to my God, always keeping remembrance of you in my prayers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">(for I am hearing of your charity and faith, which you have in the Lord Jesus and with all the saints)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">so that the participation of your faith may become evident by the recognition of every good work which is in you in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For I have found great joy and consolation in your charity, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed by you, brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Because of this, I have enough confidence in Christ Jesus to command you concerning certain things,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">but I beg you instead, for the sake of charity, since you are so much like Paul: an old man and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I beg you, on behalf of my son, whom I have begotten in my chains, Onesimus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">In times past, he was useless to you, but now he is useful both to me and to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">So I have sent him back to you. And may you receive him like my own heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">I myself wanted to retain him with me, so that he might minister to me, on your behalf, while I am in the chains of the Gospel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But I was willing to do nothing without your counsel, so as not to make use of your good deed as if out of necessity, but only willingly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">So perhaps, then, he departed from you for a time, so that you might receive him again for eternity,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">no longer as a servant, but, in place of a servant, a most beloved brother, especially to me: but how much so more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Therefore, if you hold me to be a companion, receive him as you would me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But if he has harmed you in any way, or if he is in your debt, charge it to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I, Paul, have written this with my own hand: I will repay. And I need not tell you, that you are also in debt yourself, to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">So it is, brother. May I delight with you in the Lord! Refresh my heart in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">I have written to you, trusting in your obedience, knowing, too, that you will do even more than what I say.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But also, at once, prepare a lodging for me. For I am hoping, through your prayers, to present myself to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Greet Epaphras, my fellow captive in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">and Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my helpers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
