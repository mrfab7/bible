<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="17" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Better is a dry morsel, and rest with it, Than a house full of the sacrifices of strife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A wise servant ruleth over a son causing shame, And in the midst of brethren He apportioneth an inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A refining pot is for silver, and a furnace for gold, And the trier of hearts is Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">An evil doer is attentive to lips of vanity, Falsehood is giving ear to a mischievous tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Whoso is mocking at the poor Hath reproached his Maker, Whoso is rejoicing at calamity is not acquitted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Sons’ sons are the crown of old men, And the glory of sons are their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Not comely for a fool is a lip of excellency, Much less for a noble a lip of falsehood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">A stone of grace is the bribe in the eyes of its possessors, Whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Whoso is covering transgression is seeking love, And whoso is repeating a matter Is separating a familiar friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Rebuke cometh down on the intelligent More than a hundred stripes on a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">An evil man seeketh only rebellion, And a fierce messenger is sent against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The meeting of a bereaved bear by a man, And—not a fool in his folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whoso is returning evil for good, Evil moveth not from his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The beginning of contention is a letting out of waters, And before it is meddled with leave the strife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Whoso is justifying the wicked, And condemning the righteous, Even both of these are an abomination to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Why is this—a price in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, And a heart there is none?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">At all times is the friend loving, And a brother for adversity is born.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">A man lacking heart is striking hands, A surety he becometh before his friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Whoso is loving transgression is loving debate, Whoso is making high his entrance is seeking destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The perverse of heart findeth not good, And the turned in his tongue falleth into evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Whoso is begetting a fool hath affliction for it, Yea, the father of a fool rejoiceth not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A rejoicing heart doth good to the body, And a smitten spirit drieth the bone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">A bribe from the bosom the wicked taketh, To turn aside the paths of judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The face of the intelligent is to wisdom, And the eyes of a fool—at the end of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">A provocation to his father is a foolish son, And bitterness to her that bare him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Also, to fine the righteous is not good, To smite nobles for uprightness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">One acquainted with knowledge is sparing his words, And the cool of temper is a man of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Even a fool keeping silence is reckoned wise, He who is shutting his lips intelligent!</p>
