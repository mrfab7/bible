  <verse number="1">And it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;</verse>
  <verse number="2">it came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head; and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and prostrated himself.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And David said unto him: ‘From whence comest thou?’ And he said unto him: ‘Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.’</verse>
  <verse number="4">And David said unto him: ‘How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me.’ And he answered: ‘The people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.’</verse>
  <verse number="5">And David said unto the young man that told him: ‘How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?’</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the young man that told him said: ‘As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and the horsemen pressed hard upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered: Here am I.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he said unto me: Who art thou? And I answered him: I am an Amalekite.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he said unto me: Stand, I pray thee, beside me, and slay me, for the agony hath taken hold of me; because my life is just yet in me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they wailed, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And David said unto the young man that told him: ‘Whence art thou?’ And he answered: ‘I am the son of an Amalekite stranger.’</verse>
  <verse number="14">And David said unto him: ‘How wast thou not afraid to put forth thy hand to destroy the LORD’S anointed?’</verse>
  <verse number="15">And David called one of the young men, and said: ‘Go near, and fall upon him.’ And he smote him that he died.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And David said unto him: ‘Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying: I have slain the LORD’S anointed.’</verse>
  <verse number="17">And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son,</verse>
  <verse number="18">and said—To teach the sons of Judah the bow. Behold, it is written in the book of Jashar:</verse>
  <verse number="19">Thy beauty, O Israel, upon thy high places is slain! How are the mighty fallen!</verse>
  <verse number="20">Tell it not in Gath, Publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon; Lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, Lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Ye mountains of Gilboa, Let there be no dew nor rain upon you, Neither fields of choice fruits; For there the shield of the mighty was vilely cast away, The shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.</verse>
  <verse number="22">From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, The bow of Jonathan turned not back, And the sword of Saul returned not empty.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Saul and Jonathan, the lovely and the pleasant In their lives, even in their death they were not divided; They were swifter than eagles, They were stronger than lions.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, Who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, Who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</verse>
  <verse number="25">How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! Jonathan upon thy high places is slain!</verse>
  <verse number="26">I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan; Very pleasant hast thou been unto me; Wonderful was thy love to me, Passing the love of women.</verse>
  <verse number="27">How are the mighty fallen, And the weapons of war perished!</verse>
