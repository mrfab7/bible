  <verse number="1">Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defended cities of Judah, and took them.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem to king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the fuller’s field.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then came forth to him Eliakim, Hilkiah’s son, which was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph’s son, the recorder.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Rabshakeh said to them, Say you now to Hezekiah, Thus said the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this wherein you trust?</verse>
  <verse number="5">I say, say you, (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom do you trust, that you rebel against me?</verse>
  <verse number="6">See, you trust in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt; where on if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But if you say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has taken away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, You shall worship before this altar?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now therefore give pledges, I pray you, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give you two thousand horses, if you be able on your part to set riders on them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">How then will you turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s servants, and put your trust on Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?</verse>
  <verse number="10">And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to destroy it? the LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah to Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray you, to your servants in the Syrian language; for we understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews’ language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But Rabshakeh said, Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words? has he not sent me to the men that sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink their own urine with you?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language, and said, Hear you the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thus said the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be able to deliver you.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Listen not to Hezekiah: for thus said the king of Assyria, Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me: and eat you every one of his vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink you every one the waters of his own cistern;</verse>
  <verse number="17">Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, the LORD will deliver us. Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the gods of Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?</verse>
  <verse number="21">But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of Rabshakeh.</verse>
