<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the lot came forth for the children of Joseph from the Jordan of Jericho as far as the waters of Jericho eastwards, to the wilderness which goes up from Jericho to the hill-country of Bethel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And [the border] went from Bethel to Luz, and passed to the border of the Archites to Ataroth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and went down westward to the border of the Japhletites, as far as the border of the lower Beth-horon, and to Gezer; and ended at the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the border of the children of Ephraim was according to their families; the border of their inheritance eastwards was Ataroth-Addar as far as the upper Beth-horon;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and the border went forth westwards to Micmethath on the north; and the border turned eastwards to Taanath-Shiloh, and passed by it eastwards to Janohah,</p>
