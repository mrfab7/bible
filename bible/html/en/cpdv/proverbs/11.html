<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="11" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A deceitful scale is an abomination with the Lord, and a fair weighing is his will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Wherever arrogance may be, there too is insult. But wherever humility is, there too is wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The simplicity of the just shall direct them, and the rebellion of the perverse will devastate them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Wealth will not profit in the day of vengeance. But justice shall liberate from death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The justice of the simple shall direct his way. And the impious will fall in his impiety.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The justice of the upright shall free them. And the iniquitous will be seized by their own treachery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When the impious man is dead, there will no longer be any hope. And the expectation of the anxious will perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The just one is freed from anguish. And the impious one will be handed over instead of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The pretender deceives his friend by mouth. But the just shall be freed by knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">In the good of the just, the city shall exult. And in the perdition of the impious, there shall be praise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">By the blessing of the just, the city shall be exalted. And by the mouth of the impious, it will be subverted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Whoever despises his friend is destitute in heart. But the prudent man will remain silent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whoever walks dishonestly reveals secrets. But whoever is of a faithful soul conceals what is confided by a friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Where there is no governor, the people shall fall. But where there is much counsel, well-being shall be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He will be afflicted with evil, who provides a guarantee for an outsider. But whoever is wary of traps shall be secure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A gracious woman shall discover glory. And the robust will have wealth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A merciful man benefits his own soul. But whoever is cruel casts out even his close relatives.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The impious does work with inconstancy. But for the sower of justice, there is the reward of faithfulness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Clemency prepares life. And the pursuit of evils prepares death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A depraved heart is abominable to the Lord. And his will is with those who walk in simplicity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Hand in hand, the evil shall not be innocent. But the offspring of the just shall be saved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A beautiful and senseless woman is like a gold ring in the snout of a swine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The desire of the just is entirely good. The anticipation of the impious is fury.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Some distribute their own goods, and they become wealthier. Others seize what is not their own, and they are always in need.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The soul that blesses shall be made fat. And whoever inebriates will likewise be inebriated himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Whoever hides away grain shall be cursed among the people. But a blessing is upon the head of those who sell it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He does well to rise early, who seeks what is good. But whoever is a seeker of evils shall be oppressed by them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Whoever trusts in his riches will fall. But the just shall spring up like a green leaf.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Whoever troubles his own house will possess the winds. And whoever is foolish will serve the wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The fruit of the just one is the tree of life. And whoever receives souls is wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">If the just are repaid upon the earth, how much more the impious and the sinner!</p>
