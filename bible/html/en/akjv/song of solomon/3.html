<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loves: I sought him, but I found him not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw you him whom my soul loves?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loves: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother’s house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I charge you, O you daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that you stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold his bed, which is Solomon’s; three score valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man has his sword on his thigh because of fear in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Go forth, O you daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown with which his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.</p>
