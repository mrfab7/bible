  <verse number="1">And having been saved, then they knew that the island is called Melita.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the foreigners bestowed upon us no ordinary kindness: for having lighted a pile of wood, they received us all on account of the impending rain, and for the cold.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Paul having collected together a multitude of dried sticks, and placed upon the pile of wood, a viper, having come forth out of the heat, seized his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And when the foreigners saw the wild beast hanging on his hand, they said to one another, This man is altogether a murderer, whom, saved from the sea, vengeance suffered not to live.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Who truly then, having shaken off the beast into the fire, suffered nothing evil.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And they expected him about to be inflamed, or to fall down dead suddenly: and they waiting for much, and seeing nothing extraordinary coming to him, changing their opinions, they said he was a god.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And with them about that place was landed property to the first of the island, by name Publius; who having received us, lodged us with friendship three days.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it was the father of Publius lay, held fast with fever and dysentery: to whom Paul, having come in and prayed, laid hands upon him, and healed him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then this done, the rest having sicknesses in the island, came near, and were cured:</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they honoured us with many honours; and to us getting under weigh, they set things for need.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And after three months we were conveyed in a ship, having wintered in the island, of Alexandria, marked, Sons of Jove.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And brought down to Syracuse, we tarried yet three days longer.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Whence having come round, we arrived at Rhegium: and after one day the south wind having come up, we came the second day to Puteoli:</verse>
  <verse number="14">Where having found brethren, we were besought by them to tarry yet seven days longer: and so we came to Rome.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And thence the brethren, having heard of us, came out to our meeting as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom Paul having seen, having returned thanks to God, took courage.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the commander of the camp: but to Paul it was permitted to remain by himself with a soldier watching him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And it was after three days Paul called together them being first of the Jews: and they having come together, he said to them, Men, brethren, I having done nothing against the people, or customs of the fathers, I was delivered in bonds from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Who, having examined me, wished to loose, for no cause of death was in me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the Jews saying against, I was forced to appeal to Caesar; as having nothing to accuse my nation.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For this cause therefore I besought to see you, and to speak: for, for the hope of Israel am I surrounded by this chain.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they said to him, We neither received letters concerning thee from Judea, nor any of the brethren having been present announced or spoke any evil of thee.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And we desire to hear from thee what thou thinkest: for truly of this sect it is known to us that it is everywhere spoken against.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And having appointed him a day, many came to him to the lodging; to whom testifying, he set forth the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses, and the prophets, from morn to eve.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And some truly were persuaded by things spoken, and some disbelieved.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And being at variance with one another, they were let go, Paul having said one word, That well spake the Holy Spirit by Esaias the prophet to our fathers,</verse>
  <verse number="26">Saying, Go to this people, and say, By hearing ye shall hear, and not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and ye should not perceive:</verse>
  <verse number="27">For the heart of this people was thickened, and with ears heard they heavily, and their eyes they closed; lest they should see with the eyes, and with ears should hear, and with the heart they should understand, and turn back, and I should heal them.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Be it known to you therefore, that salvation of God was sent to the nations, and they shall hear.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he having said these things, the Jews departed, having much discussion in themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And Paul remained two whole years in his own wages, and received all going to him,</verse>
  <verse number="31">Proclaiming the kingdom of God, and teaching things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom of speech, unimpeded.</verse>
