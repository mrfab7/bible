<chapter book="2 Timothy" number="4" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">I do fully testify, then, before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who is about to judge living and dead at his manifestation and his reign—</verse>
  <verse number="2">preach the word; be earnest in season, out of season, convict, rebuke, exhort, in all long-suffering and teaching,</verse>
  <verse number="3">for there shall be a season when the sound teaching they will not suffer, but according to their own desires to themselves they shall heap up teachers—itching in the hearing,</verse>
  <verse number="4">and indeed, from the truth the hearing they shall turn away, and to the fables they shall be turned aside.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And thou—watch in all things; suffer evil; do the work of one proclaiming good news; of thy ministration make full assurance,</verse>
  <verse number="6">for I am already being poured out, and the time of my release hath arrived;</verse>
  <verse number="7">the good strife I have striven, the course I have finished, the faith I have kept,</verse>
  <verse number="8">henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of the righteousness that the Lord—the Righteous Judge—shall give to me in that day, and not only to me, but also to all those loving his manifestation.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Be diligent to come unto me quickly,</verse>
  <verse number="10">for Demas forsook me, having loved the present age, and went on to Thessalonica, Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia,</verse>
  <verse number="11">Lukas only is with me; Markus having taken, bring with thyself, for he is profitable to me for ministration;</verse>
  <verse number="12">and Tychicus I sent to Ephesus;</verse>
  <verse number="13">the cloak that I left in Troas with Carpus, coming, bring thou and the books—especially the parchments.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil; may the Lord repay to him according to his works,</verse>
  <verse number="15">of whom also do thou beware, for greatly hath he stood against our words;</verse>
  <verse number="16">in my first defence no one stood with me, but all forsook me, (may it not be reckoned to them!)</verse>
  <verse number="17">and the Lord stood by me, and did strengthen me, that through me the preaching might be fully assured, and all the nations might hear, and I was freed out of the mouth of a lion,</verse>
  <verse number="18">and the Lord shall free me from every evil work, and shall save me—to his heavenly kingdom; to whom is the glory to the ages of the ages! Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Salute Prisca and Aquilas, and Onesiphorus’ household;</verse>
  <verse number="20">Erastus did remain in Corinth, and Trophimus I left in Miletus infirm;</verse>
  <verse number="21">be diligent to come before winter. Salute thee doth Eubulus, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The Lord Jesus Christ is with thy spirit; the grace is with you! Amen.</verse>
