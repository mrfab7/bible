  <verse number="1">And it will be after the death of Moses, the servant of Jehovah, Jehovah will say to Joshua, son of Nun, serving Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Moses my servant died; and now arise, pass through this Jordan, thou and all this people, to the land which I gave to them to the sons of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Every place which the sole of your foot shall tread upon it, to you I gave it as I spake to Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="4">From the desert and this Lebanon, and even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and even to the great sea, from the going down of the sun, shall be your bound.</verse>
  <verse number="5">No man shall stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, I will be with thee: I will not forsake thee and I will not leave thee.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Be strong and be active; for thou shalt cause Israel to inherit the land which I sware to their fathers to give to them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Only be strong and be greatly active, to watch to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee: thou shalt not turn aside from it to the right and to the left, so that thou shalt be wise in all things where thou shalt go.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the book of this law shall not depart from thy mouth; and meditate thou in it day and night, so that thou shalt watch to do according to all written in it: for then thou shalt prosper thy ways, and then thou shalt be wise.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Did I not command thee? Be strong and be active; thou shalt not fear and thou shalt not bend: for Jehovah thy God is with thee in all where thou shalt go.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Joshua will command the scribes of the people, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="11">Pass through in the midst of the camp and command the people, saying, Prepare to yourselves food, for yet three days ye pass through this Jordan to go to possess the land which Jehovah your God gave to you to inherit it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="13">Remember the word which Moses the servant of Jehovah commanded you, saying, Jehovah your God causes you to rest, and he gave to you this land.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall dwell in the land which Moses gave to you on the other side Jordan; and ye shall pass over, being brave, before your brethren, all being strong, of the host, and help them;</verse>
  <verse number="15">Till Jehovah shall cause rest to your brethren as you and they also shall inherit the land which Jehovah your God gave to them: and ye turned back to the land of your possession, and ye shall inherit it, which Moses the servant of Jehovah gave to you on the other side of Jordan from the rising of the sun.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they will answer Joshua, saying, All which thou didst command us, we will do, and where thou shalt send us, we will go.</verse>
  <verse number="17">According to all that we heard to Moses, so will we bear to thee: only Jehovah thy God shall be with thee as he was with Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Every man who shall resist thy mouth, and shall not hear thy words according to all which thou shalt command him, he shall die: only be strong and be active.</verse>
