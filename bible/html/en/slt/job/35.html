<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Elihu will answer and say,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Didst thou reckon this for judgment thou saidst, My justice is above God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For thou wilt say, What shall it profit to thee? what shall I profit from my sin?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I will turn back words to thee, and thy companions with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Look upon the heavens and see; behold the clouds, they were high above thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If thou sinnedst, what wilt thou do against him? and thy transgressions were multiplied, what wilt thou do to him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If thou wert just, what wilt thou give to him? or what shall he take from thy hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Thy injustice to a man as thou: and thy justice to the son of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">From the multitude of oppressions they will cry out: they will cry out from the arm of the many.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And not saying, Where is God making me? he gave songs in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And who teacheth us from the cattle of the earth, and he will make us wise above the birds of the heavens?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Then they will cry, and he will not answer from the face of the pride of the evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Also God will not hear vanity, and the Almighty will not look upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Also if thou shalt say thou wilt not see him, judgment is before him, and thou shalt wait for him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And now that it is not, he reviewed his anger, and he knew not in great transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Job will open his mouth in vain; he will bind together words without knowledge.</p>
