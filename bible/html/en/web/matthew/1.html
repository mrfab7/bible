<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this; for after his mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But when he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take to yourself Mary, your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">She shall bring forth a son. You shall call his name Jesus, for it is he who shall save his people from their sins.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Now all this has happened, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">“Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son. They shall call his name Immanuel;” which is, being interpreted, “God with us.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took his wife to himself;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">and didn’t know her sexually until she had brought forth her firstborn son. He named him Jesus.</p>
