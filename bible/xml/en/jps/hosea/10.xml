  <verse number="1">Israel was a luxuriant vine, Which put forth fruit freely: As his fruit increased, He increased his altars; The more goodly his land was, The more goodly were his pillars.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Their heart is divided; Now shall they bear their guilt; He will break down their altars, He will spoil their pillars.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Surely now shall they say: ‘We have no king; For we feared not the LORD; And the king, what can he do for us?’</verse>
  <verse number="4">They speak words, They swear falsely, they make covenants; Thus judgment springeth up as hemlock In the furrows of the field.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The inhabitants of Samaria shall be in dread For the calves of Beth-aven; For the people thereof shall mourn over it, And the priests thereof shall tremble for it, For its glory, because it is departed from it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">It also shall be carried unto Assyria, For a present to King Contentious; Ephraim shall receive shame, And Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</verse>
  <verse number="7">As for Samaria, her king is cut off, As foam upon the water.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The high places also of Aven shall be destroyed, Even the sin of Israel. The thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; And they shall say to the mountains: ‘Cover us’, And to the hills: ‘Fall on us.’</verse>
  <verse number="9">From the days of Gibeah thou hast sinned, O Israel; There they stood; No battle was to overtake them in Gibeah, Nor the children of arrogancy.</verse>
  <verse number="10">When it is My desire, I will chastise them; And the peoples shall be gathered against them, When they are yoked to their two rings.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Ephraim is a heifer well broken, That loveth to thresh, And I have passed over upon her fair neck; I will make Ephraim to ride, Judah shall plow, Jacob shall break his clods.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Sow to yourselves according to righteousness, Reap according to mercy, Break up your fallow ground; For it is time to seek the LORD, Till He come and cause righteousness to rain upon you.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity, Ye have eaten the fruit of lies; For thou didst trust in thy way, In the multitude of thy mighty men.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy hosts, And all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, As Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle; The mother was dashed in pieces with her children.</verse>
  <verse number="15">So hath Beth-el done unto you Because of your great wickedness; At daybreak is the king of Israel utterly cut off.</verse>
