<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When Ephraim spoke, there was trembling; he exalted himself in Israel: but he trespassed through Baal, and he died.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing-floor, and as the smoke out of the lattice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Yet I [am] Jehovah thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou hast known no God but me; and there is no saviour besides me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I knew thee in the wilderness, in the land of drought.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">According to their pasture, they became full; they became full, and their heart was exalted: therefore have they forgotten me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I will be unto them as a lion; as a leopard I will lurk for them by the way;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I will meet them as a bear bereaved of her [whelps], and will rend the covering of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lioness: the beast of the field shall tear them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">It is thy destruction, O Israel, that [thou art] against me, against thy help.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Where then is thy king, that he may save thee in all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a king and princes?â€”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is laid by in store.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The pangs of a woman in travail shall come upon him: he is a son not wise; for at the time of the breaking forth of children, he was not there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I will ransom them from the power of Sheol. I will redeem them from death: where, O death, are thy plagues? where, O Sheol, is thy destruction? Repentance shall be hid from mine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Though he be fruitful among [his] brethren, an east wind shall come, a wind of Jehovah [that] cometh up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Samaria shall bear her guilt; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword; their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.</p>
