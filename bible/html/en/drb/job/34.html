<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="34" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Eliu continued his discourse, and said :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear ye, wise men, my words, and ye learned, hearken to me :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the ear trieth words, and the mouth discerneth meats by the taste.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Let us choose to us judgment, and let us see among ourselves what is the best.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For Job hath said : I am just, and God hath overthrown my judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For in judging me there is a lie : my arrow is violent without any sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">What man is there like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Who goeth in company with them that work iniquity, and walketh with wicked men?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For he hath said : Man shall not please God, although he run with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore, ye men of understanding, hear me : far from god be wickedness, and iniquity from the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For he will render to a man his work, and according to the ways of every one he will reward them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For in very deed God will not condemn without cause, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">What other hath he appointed over the earth? or whom hath he set over the world which he made?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If he turn his heart to him, he shall draw his spirit and breath unto himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All flesh shall perish together, and man shall return into ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If then thou hast understanding, hear what is said, and hearken to the voice of my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Can he be healed that loveth not judgment? and how dost thou so far condemn him that is just?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Who saith to the king : Thou art an apostate : who calleth rulers ungodly?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Who accepteth not the persons of princes : nor hath regarded the tyrant, when he contended against the poor man : for all are the work of his hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">They shall suddenly die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and they shall pass, and take away the violent without hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For his eyes are upon the ways of men, and he considereth all their steps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">There is no darkness, and there is no shadow of death, where they may be hid who work iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For it is no longer in the power of man to enter into judgment with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He shall break in pieces many and innumerable, and shall make others to stand in their stead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For he knoweth their works : and therefore he shall bring night on them, and they shall be destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He hath struck them, as being wicked, in open sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Who as it were on purpose have revolted from him, and would not understand all his ways :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">So that they caused the cry of the needy to come to him, and he heard the voice of the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For when he granteth peace, who is there that can condemn? When he hideth his countenance, who is there that can behold him, whether it regard nations, or all men?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Who maketh a man that is a hypocrite to reign for the sins of the people?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Seeing then I have spoken of God, I will not hinder thee in thy turn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">If I have erred, teach thou me : if I have spoken iniquity, I will add no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Doth God require it of thee, because it hath displeased thee? for thou begannest to speak, and not I. : but if thou know any thing better, speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Let men of understanding speak to me, and let a wise man hearken to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">But Job hath spoken foolishly, and his words sound not discipline.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">My father, let Job be tried even to the end : cease not from the man of iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Because he addeth blasphemy upon his sins, let him be tied fast in the mean time amongst us : and then let him provoke God to judgment with his speeches.</p>
