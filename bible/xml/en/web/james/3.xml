<chapter book="James" number="3" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Let not many of you be teachers, my brothers, knowing that we will receive heavier judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For in many things we all stumble. If anyone doesn’t stumble in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Indeed, we put bits into the horses’ mouths so that they may obey us, and we guide their whole body.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Behold, the ships also, though they are so big and are driven by fierce winds, are yet guided by a very small rudder, wherever the pilot desires.</verse>
  <verse number="5">So the tongue is also a little member, and boasts great things. See how a small fire can spread to a large forest!</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the tongue is a fire. The world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature, and is set on fire by Gehenna.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For every kind of animal, bird, creeping thing, and thing in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by mankind.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But nobody can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</verse>
  <verse number="9">With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who are made in the image of God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Out of the same mouth comes forth blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Does a spring send out from the same opening fresh and bitter water?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Can a fig tree, my brothers, yield olives, or a vine figs? Thus no spring yields both salt water and fresh water.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show by his good conduct that his deeds are done in gentleness of wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, don’t boast and don’t lie against the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">This wisdom is not that which comes down from above, but is earthly, sensual, and demonic.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For where jealousy and selfish ambition are, there is confusion and every evil deed.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceful, gentle, reasonable, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Now the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.</verse>
