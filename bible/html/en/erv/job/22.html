<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Can a man be profitable unto God? surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Is it for thy fear of him that he reproveth thee, that he entereth with thee into judgment?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Is not thy wickedness great? neither is there any end to thine iniquities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man, he dwelt in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Or darkness, that thou canst not see, and abundance of waters cover thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And thou sayest, What doth God know? can he judge through the thick darkness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Wilt thou keep the old way which wicked men have trodden?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Who were snatched away before their time, whose foundation was poured out as a stream:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Who said unto God, Depart from us; and, What can the Almighty do for us?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Yet he fired their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The righteous see it, and are glad; and the innocent laugh them to scorn:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Saying, Surely they that did rise up against us are cut off, and the remnant of them the fire hath consumed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up; if thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And lay thou thy treasure in the dust, and the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And the Almighty shall be thy treasure, and precious silver unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For then shalt thou delight thyself in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee; and thou shalt pay thy vows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee; and light shall shine upon thy ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">When they cast thee down, thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and the humble person he shall save.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He shall deliver even him that is not innocent: yea, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thine hands.</p>
