<chapter book="Job" number="29" translation="King James Bible" translationID="kjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Oh that I were as [in] months past, as [in] the days [when] God preserved me;</verse>
  <verse number="3">When his candle shined upon my head, [and when] by his light I walked [through] darkness;</verse>
  <verse number="4">As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God [was] upon my tabernacle;</verse>
  <verse number="5">When the Almighty [was] yet with me, [when] my children [were] about me;</verse>
  <verse number="6">When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;</verse>
  <verse number="7">When I went out to the gate through the city, [when] I prepared my seat in the street!</verse>
  <verse number="8">The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, [and] stood up.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The princes refrained talking, and laid [their] hand on their mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="11">When the ear heard [me], then it blessed me; and when the eye saw [me], it gave witness to me:</verse>
  <verse number="12">Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and [him that had] none to help him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment [was] as a robe and a diadem.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I was eyes to the blind, and feet [was] I to the lame.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I [was] a father to the poor: and the cause [which] I knew not I searched out.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply [my] days as the sand.</verse>
  <verse number="19">My root [was] spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My glory [was] fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Unto me [men] gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.</verse>
  <verse number="22">After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide [as] for the latter rain.</verse>
  <verse number="24">[If] I laughed on them, they believed [it] not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.</verse>
  <verse number="25">I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one [that] comforteth the mourners.</verse>
