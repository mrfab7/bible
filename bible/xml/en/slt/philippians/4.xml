  <verse number="1">Therefore, my brethren, dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, thus stand ye in the Lord, dearly beloved.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I beseech Euodias, and I beseech Syntyche, to think the same in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I also ask thee, worthy yoke fellow, aid those women who fought in company with me in the good news, and with Clement, and the rest of my co-workers, whose names in the book of life.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Rejoice in the Lord always: again say I, Do ye rejoice.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Let your fitness be known to all men. The Lord is near.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Rave anxiety about nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with gratitude let your desires be made known to God.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the peace of God, surpassing all understanding, shall watch your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="8">As to the rest, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever venerable, whatever just, whatever pure, whatever lovely, whatever prosperous; if any ability, and if any praise, reckon up these things.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And what things ye learned, and received, and heard, and saw in me, these do; and the God of peace shall be with you.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that once already ye recovered new vigor; for thinking of me, upon whom ye were thinking, and ye had not time.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Not that I speak concerning want; for I have learned, among whom I am, to be satisfied with my condition.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And I know how to be humble, and I know how to abound in every thing: and in all I am instructed also to be full and to hunger, and to abound and to be in want.</verse>
  <verse number="13">I am strong for all things in Christ strengthening me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But ye did well, participating together in my pressure.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And ye also know, Philippians, that in the beginning of the good news, when I went out from Macedonia, no church participated with me in the word of donation and accepting, except ye alone.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For also in Thessalonica, and once, and twice, ye sent to my necessity.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Not that I covet a gift: but I covet fruit abounding to your word.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And I have all, and abound: I have been filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things from you, a smell of sweet odor, a sacrifice acceptable, pleasing to God.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And God will fill up all your need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And to God and our Father the glory for the times of times. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Greet ye every one holy in Christ Jesus. The brethren with me greet you.</verse>
  <verse number="22">All the holy greet you, and chiefly they from Caesar’s house.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you all. Amen.</verse>
