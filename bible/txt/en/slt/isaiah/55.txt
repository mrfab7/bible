1	Ho, every one thirsting, Come ye to the waters, and whom there is not to him silver, come ye, buy and eat; and come ye, and buy without silver and without price, wine and milk.
2	Wherefore will ye weigh silver without bread? and your labour not for fulness? hearing, hear ye to me, and eat good, and your soul shall delight in fatness.
3	Incline your ear, and come to me, and hear, and your soul shall live; and I will cut out with you an eternal covenant, the sure mercies of David.
4	Behold, I gave him a witness of the nations, a leader and commanding the nations.
5	Behold, nations thou shalt not know; thou shalt call, and nations that knew thee not shall run to thee, for sake of Jehovah thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he honored thee.
6	Seek ye Jehovah in his being found, and call him in his being near.
7	The unjust one shall forsake his way, and the man of vanity his purposes, and turn back to Jehovah, and he will pity him, and to our God, for he will multiply to forgive.
8	For not my purposes your purposes and not your ways my ways, says Jehovah.
9	As the heavens were high above the earth, so my ways were high above your ways, and my purposes above your purposes.
10	For as the rain coming down and the snow from the heavens, and shall not turn back there, but watering the earth and causing it to bring forth and sprout, and giving seed to be sown, and bread to be eaten;
11	So shall be my word which went forth out of my mouth: it shall not turn back to me empty, but doing what I delighted in, and it shall prosper for what I send it.
12	For with joy shall ye go forth, and in peace shall ye be led forth; the mountains and hills shall break forth before you into shouting, and all the trees of the field shall clap the hand.
13	Instead of the thorn-hedge shall come up the cypress; of the briar shall come up the myrtle: and it was to Jehovah for a name for an eternal sigh; it shall not be cut off.
