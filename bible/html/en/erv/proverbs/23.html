<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently him that is before thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Be not desirous of his dainties; seeing they are deceitful meat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Weary not thyself to be rich; cease from thine own wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings, like an eagle that flieth toward heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainties:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For as he reckoneth within himself, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Speak not in the hearing of a fool; for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Remove not the ancient landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For their redeemer is strong; he shall plead their cause against thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beat him with the rod, he shall not die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from Sheol.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall be glad, even mine:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For surely there is a reward; and thy hope shall not be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Be not among winebibbers; among gluttonous eaters of flesh:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Buy the truth, and sell it not; yea, wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Let thy father and thy mother be glad, and let her that bare thee rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes delight in my ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Yea, she lieth in wait as a robber, and increaseth the treacherous among men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath complaining? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek out mixed wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth its colour in the cup, when it goeth down smoothly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Thine eyes shall behold strange things, and thine heart shall utter froward things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not hurt; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.</p>
