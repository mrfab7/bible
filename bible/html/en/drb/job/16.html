<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I have often heard such things as these: you are all troublesome comforters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Shall windy words have no end? or is it any trouble to thee to speak?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I also could speak like you: and would God your soul were for my soul. I would comfort you also with words, and would wag my head over you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I would strengthen you with my mouth, and would move my lips, as sparing you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But what shall I do? If I speak, my pain will not rest: and if I hold my peace, it will not depart from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But now my sorrow hath oppressed me, and all my limbs are brought to nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">My wrinkles bear witness against me, and a false speaker riseth up against my face, contradicting me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He hath gathered together his fury against me, and threatening me he hath gnashed with his teeth upon me: my enemy hath beheld me with terrible eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They have opened their mouths upon me, and reproaching me they have struck me on the cheek, they are filled with my pains.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">God hath shut me up with the unjust man, and hath delivered me into the hands of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I that was formerly so wealthy, am all on a sudden broken to pieces: he hath taken me by my neck, he hath broken me, and hath set me up to be his mark.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He hath compassed me round about with his lances, he hath wounded my loins, he hath not spared, and hath poured out my bowels on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He hath torn me with wound upon wound, he hath rushed in upon me like a giant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I have sowed sackcloth upon my skin, and have covered my flesh with ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">My face is swollen with weeping, and my eyelids are dim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">These things have I suffered without the iniquity of my hand, when I offered pure prayers to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">O earth, cover not thou my blood, neither let my cry find a hiding place in thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For behold my witness is in heaven, and he that knoweth my conscience is on high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My friends are full of words: my eye poureth out tears to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And O that a man might so be judged with God, as the son of man is judged with his companion!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For behold short years pass away and I am walking in a path by which l shall not return.</p>
