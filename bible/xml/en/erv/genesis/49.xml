  <verse number="13">Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea: And he shall be for an haven of ships; And his border shall be upon Zidon.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Issachar is a strong ass, Couching down between the sheepfolds:</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he saw a resting place that it was good, And the land that it was pleasant; And he bowed his shoulder to bear, And became a servant under taskwork.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Dan shall judge his people, As one of the tribes of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Dan shall be a serpent in the way, An adder in the path, That biteth the horse’s heels, So that his rider falleth backward.</verse>

  <verse number="24">But his bow abode in strength, And the arms of his hands were made strong, By the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob, (From thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel,)</verse>
  <verse number="25">Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, And by the Almighty, who shall bless thee, With blessings of heaven above, Blessings of the deep that coucheth beneath, Blessings of the breasts, and of the womb.</verse>

  <verse number="30">in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace:</verse>
  <verse number="31">there they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah:</verse>
  <verse number="32">the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased from the children of Heth.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And when Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.</verse>
