<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="28" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The wicked flee when no one pursues; but the righteous are as bold as a lion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">In rebellion, a land has many rulers, but order is maintained by a man of understanding and knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A needy man who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain which leaves no crops.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Those who forsake the law praise the wicked; but those who keep the law contend with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Evil men don’t understand justice; but those who seek Yahweh understand it fully.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Better is the poor who walks in his integrity, than he who is perverse in his ways, and he is rich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Whoever keeps the law is a wise son; but he who is a companion of gluttons shames his father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He who increases his wealth by excessive interest gathers it for one who has pity on the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He who turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Whoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way, he will fall into his own trap; but the blameless will inherit good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The rich man is wise in his own eyes; but the poor who has understanding sees through him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He who conceals his sins doesn’t prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Blessed is the man who always fears; but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">As a roaring lion or a charging bear, so is a wicked ruler over helpless people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A tyrannical ruler lacks judgment. One who hates ill-gotten gain will have long days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A man who is tormented by life blood will be a fugitive until death; no one will support him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Whoever walks blamelessly is kept safe; but one with perverse ways will fall suddenly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">One who works his land will have an abundance of food; but one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A faithful man is rich with blessings; but one who is eager to be rich will not go unpunished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">To show partiality is not good; yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A stingy man hurries after riches, and doesn’t know that poverty waits for him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">One who rebukes a man will afterward find more favor than one who flatters with the tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Whoever robs his father or his mother, and says, “It’s not wrong.” He is a partner with a destroyer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">One who is greedy stirs up strife; but one who trusts in Yahweh will prosper.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">One who trusts in himself is a fool; but one who walks in wisdom is kept safe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">One who gives to the poor has no lack; but one who closes his eyes will have many curses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; but when they perish, the righteous thrive.</p>
