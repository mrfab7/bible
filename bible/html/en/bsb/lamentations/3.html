<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I am the man who has seen affliction under the rod of God’s wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">He has driven me away and made me walk in darkness instead of light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Indeed, He keeps turning His hand against me all day long.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He has worn away my flesh and skin; He has shattered my bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He has made me dwell in darkness like those dead for ages.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He has walled me in so I cannot escape; He has weighed me down with chains.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Even when I cry out and plead for help, He shuts out my prayer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He has barred my ways with cut stones; He has made my paths crooked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He is a bear lying in wait, a lion hiding in ambush.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He forced me off my path and tore me to pieces; He left me without help.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He bent His bow and set me as the target for His arrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He pierced my kidneys with His arrows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I am a laughingstock to all my people; they mock me in song all day long.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He has filled me with bitterness; He has intoxicated me with wormwood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He has ground my teeth with gravel and trampled me in the dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">My soul has been deprived of peace; I have forgotten what prosperity is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">So I say, “My strength has perished, along with my hope from the LORD.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Remember my affliction and wandering, the wormwood and the gall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Surely my soul remembers and is humbled within me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Yet I call this to mind, and therefore I have hope:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Because of the loving devotion of the LORD we are not consumed, for His mercies never fail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">“The LORD is my portion,” says my soul, “therefore I will hope in Him.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The LORD is good to those who wait for Him, to the soul who seeks Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">It is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is still young.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Let him sit alone in silence, for the LORD has laid it upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Let him bury his face in the dust—perhaps there is still hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Let him offer his cheek to the one who would strike him; let him be filled with reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For the Lord will not cast us off forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Even if He causes grief, He will show compassion according to His abundant loving devotion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">For He does not willingly afflict or grieve the sons of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">To crush underfoot all the prisoners of the land,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">to deny a man justice before the Most High,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">to subvert a man in his lawsuit—of these the Lord does not approve.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Who has spoken and it came to pass, unless the Lord has ordained it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">Do not both adversity and good come from the mouth of the Most High?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Why should any mortal man complain, in view of his sins?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Let us examine and test our ways, and turn back to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Let us lift up our hearts and hands to God in heaven:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">“We have sinned and rebelled; You have not forgiven.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">You have covered Yourself in anger and pursued us; You have killed without pity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">You have covered Yourself with a cloud that no prayer can pass through.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">You have made us scum and refuse among the nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">All our enemies open their mouths against us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">Panic and pitfall have come upon us—devastation and destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">Streams of tears flow from my eyes over the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">My eyes overflow unceasingly, without relief,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">until the LORD looks down from heaven and sees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">My eyes bring grief to my soul because of all the daughters of my city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">Without cause my enemies hunted me like a bird.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">They dropped me alive into a pit and cast stones upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">The waters flowed over my head, and I thought I was going to die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">I called on Your name, O LORD, out of the depths of the Pit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">You heard my plea: “Do not ignore my cry for relief.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="57">You drew near when I called on You; You said, “Do not be afraid.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="58">You defend my cause, O Lord; You redeem my life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="59">You have seen, O LORD, the wrong done to me; vindicate my cause!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="60">You have seen all their malice, all their plots against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="61">O LORD, You have heard their insults, all their plots against me—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="62">the slander and murmuring of my assailants against me all day long.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="63">When they sit and when they rise, see how they mock me in song.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="64">You will pay them back what they deserve, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="65">Put a veil of anguish over their hearts; may Your curse be upon them!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="66">You will pursue them in anger and exterminate them from under Your heavens, O LORD.</p>
