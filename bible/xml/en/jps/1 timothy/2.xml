<chapter book="1 Timothy" number="2" translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" translationID="jps" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">I exhort then, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions and thanksgivings be offered on behalf of all men;</verse>
  <verse number="2">including kings and all who are in high station, in order that we may live peaceful and tranquil lives with all godliness and gravity.</verse>
  <verse number="3">This is right, and is pleasing in the sight of God our Saviour,</verse>
  <verse number="4">who is willing for all mankind to be saved and come to a full knowledge of the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For there is but one God and but one Mediator between God and men—Christ Jesus, Himself man;</verse>
  <verse number="6">who gave Himself as the redemption price for all—a fact testified to at its own appointed time,</verse>
  <verse number="7">and of which I have been appointed a herald and an Apostle (I am speaking the truth: it is not a fiction)</verse>
  <verse number="8">So then I would have the men everywhere pray, lifting to God holy hands which are unstained with anger or strife;</verse>
  <verse number="9">and I would have the women dress becomingly, with modesty and self-control, not with plaited hair or gold or pearls or costly clothes,</verse>
  <verse number="10">but—as befits women making a claim to godliness—with the ornament of good works.</verse>
  <verse number="11">A woman should quietly learn from others with entire submissiveness.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I do not permit a woman to teach, nor have authority over a man, but she must remain silent.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For Adam was formed first, and then Eve;</verse>
  <verse number="14">and Adam was not deceived, but his wife was thoroughly deceived, and so became involved in transgression.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Yet a woman will be brought safely through childbirth if she and her husband continue to live in faith and love and growing holiness, with habitual self-restraint.</verse>
