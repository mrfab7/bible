  <verse number="1">In that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who then is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?”</verse>
  <verse number="2">Jesus called a little child to himself, and set him in their midst,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and said, “Most certainly I tell you, unless you turn, and become as little children, you will in no way enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Whoever therefore humbles himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Whoever receives one such little child in my name receives me,</verse>
  <verse number="6">but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him that a huge millstone should be hung around his neck, and that he should be sunk in the depths of the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="7">“Woe to the world because of occasions of stumbling! For it must be that the occasions come, but woe to that person through whom the occasion comes!</verse>
  <verse number="8">If your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life maimed or crippled, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into the eternal fire.</verse>
  <verse number="9">If your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the Gehenna of fire.</verse>
  <verse number="10">See that you don’t despise one of these little ones, for I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost.</verse>
  <verse number="12">“What do you think? If a man has one hundred sheep, and one of them goes astray, doesn’t he leave the ninety-nine, go to the mountains, and seek that which has gone astray?</verse>
  <verse number="13">If he finds it, most certainly I tell you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.</verse>
  <verse number="15">“If your brother sins against you, go, show him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained back your brother.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But if he doesn’t listen, take one or two more with you, that at the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</verse>
  <verse number="17">If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the assembly. If he refuses to hear the assembly also, let him be to you as a Gentile or a tax collector.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Most certainly I tell you, whatever things you bind on earth will have been bound in heaven, and whatever things you release on earth will have been released in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Again, assuredly I tell you, that if two of you will agree on earth concerning anything that they will ask, it will be done for them by my Father who is in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst.”</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then Peter came and said to him, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Until seven times?”</verse>
  <verse number="22">Jesus said to him, “I don’t tell you until seven times, but, until seventy times seven.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Therefore the Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who wanted to reconcile accounts with his servants.</verse>
  <verse number="24">When he had begun to reconcile, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But because he couldn’t pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, with his wife, his children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.</verse>
  <verse number="26">The servant therefore fell down and kneeled before him, saying, ‘Lord, have patience with me, and I will repay you all!’</verse>
  <verse number="27">The lord of that servant, being moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt.</verse>
  <verse number="28">“But that servant went out, and found one of his fellow servants, who owed him one hundred denarii, and he grabbed him, and took him by the throat, saying, ‘Pay me what you owe!’</verse>
  <verse number="29">“So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will repay you!’</verse>
  <verse number="30">He would not, but went and cast him into prison, until he should pay back that which was due.</verse>
  <verse number="31">So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were exceedingly sorry, and came and told to their lord all that was done.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Then his lord called him in, and said to him, ‘You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt, because you begged me.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Shouldn’t you also have had mercy on your fellow servant, even as I had mercy on you?’</verse>
  <verse number="34">His lord was angry, and delivered him to the tormentors, until he should pay all that was due to him.</verse>
  <verse number="35">So my heavenly Father will also do to you, if you don’t each forgive your brother from your hearts for his misdeeds.”</verse>
