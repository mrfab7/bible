  <verse number="1">THE vision of Isaias the son of Amos I which he saw concerning Juda and Jerusalem in the days of Ozias, Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings of Juda</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath spoken. I have brought up children, and exalted them: but they have despised me.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but Israel hath not known me, and my people hath not understood.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Woe to the sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a wicked seed, ungracious children: they have forsaken the Lord, they have blasphemed the Holy One of Israel, they are gone away backwards.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For what shall I strike you any more, you that increase transgression? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart is sad.</verse>
  <verse number="6">From the sole of the foot unto the top of the head, there is no soundness therein: wounds and bruises and swelling sores: they are not bound up, nor dressed, nor fomented with oil.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Your land is desolate, your cities are burnt with fire: your country strangers devour before your face, and it shall be desolate as when wasted by enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the daughter of Sion shall be left as a covert in a vineyard, and as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, and as a city that is laid waste.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Except the Lord of hosts had left us seed, we had been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrha.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom, give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrha.</verse>
  <verse number="11">To what purpose do you offer me the multitude of your victims, saith the Lord? I am full, I desire not holocausts of rams, and fat of fatlings, and blood of calves, and lambs, and buck goats.</verse>
  <verse number="12">When you came to appear before me, who required these things at your hands, that you should walk in my courts?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Offer sacrifice no more in vain: incense is an abomination tome. The new moons, and the sabbaths, and other festivals I will not abide, your assemblies are wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="14">My soul hateth your new moons, and your solemnities: they are become troublesome to me, I am weary of bearing them.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And when you stretch forth your hands, I will turn away my eyes from you: and when you multiply prayer, I will not hear: for your hands are full of blood.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Wash yourselves, be clean, take away the evil of your devices from my eyes: cease to do perversely,</verse>
  <verse number="17">Learn to do well: seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge for the fatherless, defend the widow.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And then come, and accuse me, saith the Lord: if your sins be as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snow: and if they be red as crimson, they shall be white as wool.</verse>
  <verse number="19">if you be willing, and will hearken to me, you shall eat the good things of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But if you will not, and will provoke me to wrath: the sword shall devour you because the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.</verse>
  <verse number="21">How is the faithful city, that was full of judgment, become a harlot? justice dwelt in it, but now murderers.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Thy silver is turned into dress: thy wine is mingled with water.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Thy princes are faithless, companions of thieves: they all love bribes, the run after rewards. They judge not for the fatherless: and the widow’s cometh not in to them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore saith the Lord the God of hosts, the mighty one of Israel: Ah! I will comfort myself over my adversaries: and I will be revenged of my enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And I will turn my hand to thee, and I will clean purge away thy dress, and I will take away all thy tin.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And I will restore thy judges se they were before, and thy counsellors as of old. After this thou shalt be called the city of the just, a faithful city.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Sion shall be redeemed in judgment, and they shall bring her back in justice.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And he shall destroy the wicked, and the sinners together: and they that have forsaken the Lord, shall be consumed.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For they shall be confounded for the idols, to which they have sacrificed: and you shall be ashamed of the gardens which you have chosen.</verse>
  <verse number="30">When you shall be as an oak with the leaves falling off, and as a garden without water.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And your strength shall be as the ashes of tow, and your work as a spark: and both shall burn together, and there shall be none to quench it.</verse>
