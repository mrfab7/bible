<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, the sent of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">To Timothy, dearly beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I have grace to God, whom I serve from the forefathers in pure consciousness, as I have continual remembrance concerning thee in my prayers night and day;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Desiring earnestly to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Receiving the report of unfeigned faith in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">By which I remind thee of the cause to light up the favor of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For God gave not to us the spirit of timidity; but of power, and love, and of soundness of mind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Therefore shouldest thou not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his imprisoned: but partake of afflictions with the good news according to the power of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who having saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, given us in Christ Jesus before eternal times,</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="11">To which I was set a herald, and sent, teacher of the nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">By which cause I also suffer these things: but I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and have been persuaded that he is able to watch my deposits to that day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hold the model of sound words, which thou didst hear of me, in the faith and love which in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Watch the good deposit by the Holy Spirit dwelling in us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thou knowest this, that all they dwelling in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">May the Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for many times he refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my perplexity:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But, being in Rome, he sought me very diligently, and found.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">(May, the Lord give to him to find mercy of the Lord in that day:) and in how many things he served in Ephesus, thou knowest better.</p>
