<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazar Enan: this shall be your north border.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">“‘You shall mark out your east border from Hazar Enan to Shepham;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down, and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">and the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the Salt Sea. This shall be your land according to its borders around it.’”</p>
