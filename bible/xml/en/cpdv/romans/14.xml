  <verse number="1">But accept those who are weak in faith, without disputing about ideas.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For one person believes that he may eat all things, but if another is weak, let him eat plants.</verse>
  <verse number="3">He who eats should not despise him who does not eat. And he who does not eat should not judge him who eats. For God has accepted him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who are you to judge the servant of another? He stands or falls by his own Lord. But he shall stand. For God is able to make him stand.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For one person discerns one age from the next. But another discerns unto every age. Let each one increase according to his own mind.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He who understands the age, understands for the Lord. And he who eats, eats for the Lord; for he gives thanks to God. And he who does not eat, does not eat for the Lord, and he gives thanks to God.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For none of us lives for himself, and none of us dies for himself.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For if we live, we live for the Lord, and if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For Christ died and rose again for this purpose: that he might be the ruler of both the dead and the living.</verse>
  <verse number="10">So then, why do you judge your brother? Or why do you despise your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For it is written: “As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bend to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.”</verse>
  <verse number="12">And so, each one of us shall offer an explanation of himself to God.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Therefore, we should no longer judge one another. Instead, judge this to a greater extent: that you should not place an obstacle before your brother, nor lead him astray.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I know, with confidence in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean in and of itself. But to him who considers anything to be unclean, it is unclean to him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For if your brother is grieved because of your food, you are not now walking according to love. Do not allow your food to destroy him for whom Christ died.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore, what is good for us should not be a cause of blasphemy.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but rather justice and peace and joy, in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For he who serves Christ in this, pleases God and is proven before men.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And so, let us pursue the things that are of peace, and let us keep to the things that are for the edification of one another.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Do not be willing to destroy the work of God because of food. Certainly, all things are clean. But there is harm for a man who offends by eating.</verse>
  <verse number="21">It is good to refrain from eating meat and from drinking wine, and from anything by which your brother is offended, or led astray, or weakened.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Do you have faith? It belongs to you, so hold it before God. Blessed is he who does not judge himself in that by which he is tested.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But he who discerns, if he eats, is condemned, because it is not of faith. For all that is not of faith is sin.</verse>
