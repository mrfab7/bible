  <verse number="1">And he bringeth me in unto the temple, and he measureth the posts, six cubits the breadth on this side, and six cubits the breadth on that side—the breadth of the tent.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the breadth of the opening is ten cubits; and the sides of the opening are five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side; and he measureth its length forty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he hath gone inward, and measureth the post of the opening two cubits, and the opening six cubits, and the breadth of the opening seven cubits.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he measureth its length twenty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits, unto the front of the temple, and he saith unto me, ‘This is the holy of holies.’</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he measureth the wall of the house six cubits, and the breadth of the side-chamber four cubits, all round the house round about.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the side-chambers are side-chamber by side-chamber, three and thirty times; and they are entering into the wall—which the house hath for the side-chambers all round about—to be taken hold of, and they are not taken hold of by the wall of the house.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And a broad place and a turning place still upwards are to the side-chambers, for the turning round of the house is still upwards all round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house is upwards, and so the lower one goeth up unto the higher by the midst.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And I have looked at the house, the height all round about: the foundations of the side-chambers are the fulness of the reed, six cubits by the joining.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The breadth of the wall that is to the side-chamber at the outside is five cubits; and that which is left is the place of the side-chambers that are to the house.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And between the chambers is a breadth of twenty cubits round about the house, all round about.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the opening of the side-chamber is to the place left, one opening northward, and one opening southward, and the breadth of the place that is left is five cubits all round about.</verse>
  <verse number="12">As to the building that is at the front of the separate place at the corner westward, the breadth is seventy cubits, and the wall of the building five cubits broad all round about, and its length ninety cubits.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he hath measured the house, the length is a hundred cubits; and the separate place, and the building, and its walls, the length is a hundred cubits;</verse>
  <verse number="14">and the breadth of the front of the house, and of the separate place eastward, a hundred cubits.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he hath measured the length of the building unto the front of the separate place that is at its hinder part, and its galleries on this side and on that side, a hundred cubits, and the inner temple and the porches of the court,</verse>
  <verse number="16">the thresholds, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round about them three, over-against the threshold, a ceiling of wood all round about, and the ground unto the windows and the covered windows,</verse>
  <verse number="17">over above the opening, and unto the inner-house, and at the outside, and by all the wall all round about within and without by measure.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And it is made with cherubs and palm-trees, and a palm-tree is between cherub and cherub, and two faces are to the cherub;</verse>
  <verse number="19">and the face of man is unto the palm-tree on this side, and the face of a young lion unto the palm-tree on that side; it is made unto all the house all round about.</verse>
  <verse number="20">from the earth unto above the opening are the cherubs and the palm-trees made, and on the wall of the temple.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Of the temple the side post is square, and of the front of the sanctuary, the appearance is as the appearance.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Of the altar, the wood is three cubits in height, and its length two cubits; and its corners are to it, and its length, and its walls are of wood, and he speaketh unto me, ‘This is the table that is before Jehovah.’</verse>
  <verse number="23">And two doors are to the temple and to the sanctuary;</verse>
  <verse number="24">and two leaves are to the doors, two turning leaves are to the doors, two to the one door, and two leaves to the other.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And made on them, on the doors of the temple, are cherubs and palm-trees as are made on the walls, and a thickness of wood is at the front of the porch on the outside.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And narrow windows and palm-trees are on this side, and on that side, at the sides of the porch, and the side-chambers of the house, and the thick places.</verse>
