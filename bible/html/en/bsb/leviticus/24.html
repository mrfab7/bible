<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then the LORD said to Moses,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Command the Israelites to bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to keep the lamps burning continually.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Outside the veil of the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron is to tend the lamps continually before the LORD from evening until morning. This is to be a permanent statute for the generations to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He shall tend the lamps on the pure gold lampstand before the LORD continually.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">You are also to take fine flour and bake twelve loaves, using two-tenths of an ephah for each loaf,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and set them in two rows—six per row—on the table of pure gold before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And you are to place pure frankincense near each row, so that it may serve as a memorial portion for the bread, a food offering to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Every Sabbath day the bread is to be set out before the LORD on behalf of the Israelites as a permanent covenant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">It belongs to Aaron and his sons, who are to eat it in a holy place; for it is to him a most holy part of the food offerings to the LORD—his portion forever.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Now the son of an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father went out among the Israelites, and a fight broke out in the camp between him and an Israelite.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name with a curse. So they brought him to Moses. (His mother’s name was Shelomith daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They placed him in custody until the will of the LORD should be made clear to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Then the LORD said to Moses,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">“Take the blasphemer outside the camp, and have all who heard him lay their hands on his head; then have the whole assembly stone him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And you are to tell the Israelites, ‘If anyone curses his God, he shall bear the consequences of his sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Whoever blasphemes the name of the LORD must surely be put to death; the whole assembly must surely stone him, whether he is a foreign resident or native; if he blasphemes the Name, he must be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And if a man takes the life of anyone else, he must surely be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Whoever kills an animal must make restitution—life for life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If anyone injures his neighbor, whatever he has done must be done to him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth. Just as he injured the other person, the same must be inflicted on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Whoever kills an animal must make restitution, but whoever kills a man must be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">You are to have the same standard of law for the foreign resident and the native; for I am the LORD your God.’”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Then Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him. So the Israelites did as the LORD had commanded Moses.</p>
