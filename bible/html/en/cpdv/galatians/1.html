<div class="chapter" data-book="Galatians" data-chapter="1" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, an Apostle, not from men and not through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and all the brothers who are with me: to the churches of Galatia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Grace and peace to you from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">who gave himself on behalf of our sins, so that he might deliver us from this present wicked age, according to the will of God our Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">To him is glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I wonder that you have been so quickly transferred, from him who called you into the grace of Christ, over to another gospel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For there is no other, except that there are some persons who disturb you and who want to overturn the Gospel of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But if anyone, even we ourselves or an Angel from Heaven, were to preach to you a gospel other than the one that we have preached to you, let him be anathema.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Just as we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone has preached a gospel to you, other than that which you have received, let him be anathema.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For am I now persuading men, or God? Or, am I seeking to please men? If I still were pleasing men, then I would not be a servant of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For I would have you understand, brothers, that the Gospel which has been preached by me is not according to man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And I did not receive it from man, nor did I learn it, except through the revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For you have heard of my former behavior within Judaism: that, beyond measure, I persecuted the Church of God and fought against Her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my equals among my own kind, having proven to be more abundant in zeal toward the traditions of my fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But, when it pleased him who, from my mother’s womb, had set me apart, and who has called me by his grace,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">to reveal his Son within me, so that I might evangelize him among the Gentiles, I did not next seek the consent of flesh and blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Neither did I go to Jerusalem, to those who were Apostles before me. Instead, I went into Arabia, and next I returned to Damascus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem to see Peter; and I stayed with him for fifteen days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But I saw none of the other Apostles, except James, the brother of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now what I am writing to you: behold, before God, I am not lying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Next, I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For they had only heard that: “He, who formerly persecuted us, now evangelizes the faith which he once fought.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And they glorified God in me.</p>
