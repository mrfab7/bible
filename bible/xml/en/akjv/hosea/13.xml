<chapter book="Hosea" number="13" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">When Ephraim spoke trembling, he exalted himself in Israel; but when he offended in Baal, he died.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, and idols according to their own understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early dew that passes away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Yet I am the LORD your God from the land of Egypt, and you shall know no god but me: for there is no savior beside me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I did know you in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.</verse>
  <verse number="6">According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they forgotten me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore I will be to them as a lion: as a leopard by the way will I observe them:</verse>
  <verse number="8">I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and will rend the lobe of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">O Israel, you have destroyed yourself; but in me is your help.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I will be your king: where is any other that may save you in all your cities? and your judges of whom you said, Give me a king and princes?</verse>
  <verse number="11">I gave you a king in my anger, and took him away in my wrath.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come on him: he is an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death: O death, I will be your plagues; O grave, I will be your destruction: repentance shall be hid from my eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Though he be fruitful among his brothers, an east wind shall come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness, and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Samaria shall become desolate; for she has rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up.</verse>
