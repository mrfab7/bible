<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But the LORD said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh, for because of My mighty hand he will let the people go; because of My strong hand he will drive them out of his land.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">God also told Moses, “I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by My name the LORD I did not make Myself known to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I also established My covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land where they lived as foreigners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Furthermore, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered My covenant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Therefore tell the Israelites: ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians and deliver you from their bondage. I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I will take you as My own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD!’”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Moses relayed this message to the Israelites, but on account of their broken spirit and cruel bondage, they did not listen to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">So the LORD said to Moses,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">“Go and tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his land.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But in the LORD’s presence Moses replied, “If the Israelites will not listen to me, then why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I am unskilled in speech?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them a charge concerning both the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">These were the heads of their fathers’ houses: The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, were Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These were the clans of Reuben.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="26">It was this Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, “Bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by their divisions.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Moses and Aaron were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt in order to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Now on the day that the LORD spoke to Moses in Egypt,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He said to him, “I am the LORD; tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I say to you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">But in the LORD’s presence Moses replied, “Since I am unskilled in speech, why would Pharaoh listen to me?”</p>
