  <verse number="1">And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou didst curse, and speak of also in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver to the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Yet he restored the money to his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made of it a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the man Micah had a house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.</verse>
  <verse number="6">In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the man departed out of the city from Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Micah said to him, Whence comest thou? And he said to him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was to him as one of his sons.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then said Micah, Now I know that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite for my priest.</verse>
