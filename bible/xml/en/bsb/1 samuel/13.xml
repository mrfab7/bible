<chapter book="1 Samuel" number="13" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Saul was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned over Israel forty-two years.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He chose for himself three thousand men of Israel: Two thousand were with Saul at Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. And the rest of the troops he sent away, each to his own home.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then Jonathan attacked the Philistine outpost at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. So Saul blew the ram’s horn throughout the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear!”</verse>
  <verse number="4">And all Israel heard the news: “Saul has attacked an outpost of the Philistines, and now Israel has become a stench to the Philistines!” Then the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now the Philistines assembled to fight against Israel with three thousand chariots, six thousand horsemen, and troops as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They went up and camped at Michmash, east of Beth-aven.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Seeing that they were in danger because their troops were hard-pressed, the men of Israel hid in caves and thickets, among the rocks, and in cellars and cisterns.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan into the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul, however, remained at Gilgal, and all his troops were quaking in fear.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Saul waited seven days for the time appointed by Samuel, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the troops began to desert Saul.</verse>
  <verse number="9">So he said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings.” And he offered up the burnt offering.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Just as he finished offering the burnt offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to greet him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">“What have you done?” Samuel asked. And Saul replied, “When I saw that the troops were deserting me, and that you did not come at the appointed time and the Philistines were gathering at Michmash,</verse>
  <verse number="12">I thought, ‘Now the Philistines will descend upon me at Gilgal, and I have not sought the favor of the LORD.’ So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">“You have acted foolishly,” Samuel declared. “You have not kept the command that the LORD your God gave you; if you had, the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel for all time.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But now your kingdom will not endure; the LORD has sought a man after His own heart and appointed him ruler over His people, because you have not kept the command of the LORD.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then Samuel set out from Gilgal and went up to Gibeah in Benjamin. And Saul numbered the troops who were with him, about six hundred men.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Now Saul and Jonathan his son and the troops with them were staying in Geba of Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Michmash.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And raiders went out of the Philistine camp in three divisions. One headed toward Ophrah in the land of Shual,</verse>
  <verse number="18">another toward Beth-horon, and the third down the border road overlooking the Valley of Zeboim facing the wilderness.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And no blacksmith could be found in all the land of Israel, because the Philistines had said, “The Hebrews must not be allowed to make swords or spears.”</verse>
  <verse number="20">Instead, all the Israelites would go down to the Philistines to sharpen their plowshares, mattocks, axes, and sickles.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The charge was a pim for sharpening a plowshare or mattock, a third of a shekel for sharpening a pitchfork or an axe, and a third of a shekel for repointing an oxgoad.</verse>
  <verse number="22">So on the day of battle not a sword or spear could be found in the hands of the troops with Saul and Jonathan; only Saul and his son Jonathan had weapons.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And a garrison of the Philistines had gone out to the pass at Michmash.</verse>
