<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But as for you, speak the things that are consistent with sound doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Older men are to be temperate, dignified, self-controlled, and sound in faith, love, and perseverance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Older women, likewise, are to be reverent in their behavior, not slanderers or addicted to much wine, but teachers of good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">In this way they can train the young women to love their husbands and children,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">to be self-controlled, pure, managers of their households, kind, and submissive to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be discredited.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In the same way, urge the younger men to be self-controlled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In everything, show yourself to be an example by doing good works. In your teaching show integrity, dignity,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">and wholesome speech that is above reproach, so that anyone who opposes us will be ashamed, having nothing bad to say about us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Slaves are to submit to their own masters in everything, to be well-pleasing, not argumentative,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">not stealing from them, but showing all good faith, so that in every respect they will adorn the teaching about God our Savior.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to everyone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">It instructs us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live sensible, upright, and godly lives in the present age,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">as we await the blessed hope and glorious appearance of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He gave Himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Speak these things as you encourage and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise you.</p>
