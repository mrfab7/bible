  <verse number="1">The wilderness and the parched land shall be glad; And the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.</verse>
  <verse number="2">It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice, Even with joy and singing; The glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, The excellency of Carmel and Sharon; They shall see the glory of the LORD, The excellency of our God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Strengthen ye the weak hands, And make firm the tottering knees.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Say to them that are of a fearful heart: ‘Be strong, fear not’; Behold, your God will come with vengeance, With the recompense of God He will come and save you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, And the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, And the tongue of the dumb shall sing; For in the wilderness shall waters break out, And streams in the desert.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the parched land shall become a pool, And the thirsty ground springs of water; In the habitation of jackals herds shall lie down, It shall be an enclosure for reeds and rushes.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And a highway shall be there, and a way, And it shall be called The way of holiness; The unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those; The wayfaring men, yea fools, shall not err therein.</verse>
  <verse number="9">No lion shall be there, Nor shall any ravenous beast go up thereon, They shall not be found there; But the redeemed shall walk there;</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, And come with singing unto Zion, And everlasting joy shall be upon their heads; They shall obtain gladness and joy, And sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</verse>
