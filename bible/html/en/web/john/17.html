<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Jesus said these things, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, “Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son, that your Son may also glorify you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">even as you gave him authority over all flesh, he will give eternal life to all whom you have given him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">This is eternal life, that they should know you, the only true God, and him whom you sent, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I glorified you on the earth. I have accomplished the work which you have given me to do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Now, Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world existed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I revealed your name to the people whom you have given me out of the world. They were yours, and you have given them to me. They have kept your word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Now they have known that all things whatever you have given me are from you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">for the words which you have given me I have given to them, and they received them, and knew for sure that I came forth from you, and they have believed that you sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I pray for them. I don’t pray for the world, but for those whom you have given me, for they are yours.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">All things that are mine are yours, and yours are mine, and I am glorified in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them through your name which you have given me, that they may be one, even as we are.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name. Those whom you have given me I have kept. None of them is lost, except the son of destruction, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But now I come to you, and I say these things in the world, that they may have my joy made full in themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I have given them your word. The world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I pray not that you would take them from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">They are not of the world even as I am not of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Sanctify them in your truth. Your word is truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">As you sent me into the world, even so I have sent them into the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Not for these only do I pray, but for those also who believe in me through their word,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">that they may all be one; even as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be one in us; that the world may believe that you sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The glory which you have given me, I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">I in them, and you in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that you sent me, and loved them, even as you loved me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Father, I desire that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am, that they may see my glory, which you have given me, for you loved me before the foundation of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Righteous Father, the world hasn’t known you, but I knew you; and these knew that you sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I made known to them your name, and will make it known; that the love with which you loved me may be in them, and I in them.”</p>
