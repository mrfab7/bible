<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then he called in mine ears with a loud voice, saying: ‘Cause ye them that have charge over the city to draw near, every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And, behold, six men came from the way of the upper gate, which lieth toward the north, every man with his weapon of destruction in his hand; and one man in the midst of them clothed in linen, with a writer’s inkhorn on his side. And they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon it was, to the threshold of the house; and He called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn on his side.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the LORD said unto him: ‘Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that are done in the midst thereof.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And to the others He said in my hearing: ‘Go ye through the city after him, and smite; let not your eye spare, neither have ye pity;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">slay utterly the old man, the young man and the maiden, and little children and women; but come not near any man upon whom is the mark; and begin at My sanctuary.’ Then they began at the elders that were before the house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And He said unto them: ‘Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain; go ye forth.’ And they went forth, and smote in the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And it came to pass, while they were smiting, and I was left, that I fell upon my face, and cried, and said: ‘Ah Lord GOD! wilt Thou destroy all the residue of Israel in Thy pouring out of Thy fury upon Jerusalem?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then said He unto me: ‘The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of wresting of judgment; for they say: The LORD hath forsaken the land, and the LORD seeth not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And as for Me also, Mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will bring their way upon their head.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And, behold, the man clothed in linen, who had the inkhorn on his side, reported, saying: ‘I have done according to all that Thou hast commanded me.’</p>
