<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And when they draw near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, to the mount of Olives, he sends two of his disciples,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And says to them, Retire into the town over against you: and quickly going into it, ye shall find a colt tied, upon which none of men has sat; having loosed, bring him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And if any say to you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord has need of him; and quickly will he send him here.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they went away, and found the colt tied to the door without by the road, and they loose him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And certain standing there said to them, What do ye, loosing the colt?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And they said as Jesus charged them: and they let them go.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And they brought the colt to Jesus, and they cast their garments upon him, and he sat upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And many strewed their garments in the way: and others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed in the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And they going before, and they following, cried, saying, Osanna; praised he coming in the name of the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Praised the kingdom coming in the name of the Lord of our father David: Osanna in the highest ones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Jesus came into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and having looked around upon all things, the hour being already coming, he went into Bethany with the twelve.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And in the morrow, they having come from Bethany, he hungered:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And having seen a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if yet he shall find any thing upon it; and having come to it, he found nothing except leaves; for it was not time of the figs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Jesus having answered, said to it, May none eat more fruit of thee forever. And his disciples heard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus having entered into the temple, began to cast out those selling and buying in the temple; and the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those selling doves he overturned;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he permitted not that any should bring a vessel through the temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he taught, saying to them, Has it not been written, That my house shall be called the house of prayer to all nations? and ye made it a den of robbers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the scribes and chief priests heard, and they sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, for all the crowd were struck with amazement at his teaching.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And when it was evening, he went without the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And in the morning, coming near, they saw the fig tree having been dried up from the roots.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Peter, having recalled to mind, says to him, Rabbi, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is dried up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Jesus having answered, says to them, Have the faith of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For truly I say to you, That whoever should say to this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and should not discuss in his heart, but believe that what he says, is; it shall be to him, whatever he should say.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For this I say to you, All things whatever, praying, ye ask, believe that ye receive, and it shall be to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And when ye stand praying, let go, if ye have any thing against any one: that also your Father, he in the heavens, might let go to you your falls.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And if ye do not let go, neither will your Father, he in the heavens, let go your falls.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And they come again to Jerusalem: and he walking in the temple, the chief priests, and scribes, and elders come to him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And say to him, By what power doest thou these things? and who gave thee this power that thou doest these things?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Jesus having answered, said to them, And I will ask you one word, and answer ye me, and I will tell you by what power I do these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Was the immersion of John from heaven, or from men? answer me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we say, From heaven; he will say, Wherefore did ye not believe him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">But if we say, of men; they feared the people: for all held John, that he was truly a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And having answered they say to Jesus, We know not. And Jesus having answered, says to them, Neither say I to you by what power I do these things.</p>
