  <verse number="1">And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children to Leah, and to Rachel, and to the two handmaids.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph last.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him: and they wept.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children; and said, Who are those with you? And he said, The children which God has graciously given your servant.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they bowed themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he said, What mean you by all this drove which I met? And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that you have to yourself.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Jacob said, No, I pray you, if now I have found grace in your sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I have seen your face, as though I had seen the face of God, and you were pleased with me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Take, I pray you, my blessing that is brought to you; because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough. And he urged him, and he took it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before you.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he said to him, My lord knows that the children are tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Let my lord, I pray you, pass over before his servant: and I will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goes before me and the children be able to endure, until I come to my lord to Seir.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Esau said, Let me now leave with you some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What needs it? let me find grace in the sight of my lord.</verse>
  <verse number="16">So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his tent before the city.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for an hundred pieces of money.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.</verse>
