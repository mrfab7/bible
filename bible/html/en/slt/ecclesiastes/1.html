<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The words of the preacher, son of David, king in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Vanity of vanities, said the preacher; vanity of vanities, all vanity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">What the profit to a man in all the labor he will labor under the sun?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A generation went away, and a generation came: and the earth stood forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The sun arose and the sun went down, and panted after its place which it arose there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Going to the south and turning round about to the north, it turned round about; the wind turned round about, going, and the wind turned back upon its circuits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All the torrents going into the sea, and the sea not full: to the place the torrents going, there they turn back to go.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">All words becoming weary; man shall not be able to speak: the eye shall not be satisfied to see, and the ear shall not be filled from hearing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What was, that shall be; and what was done, that shall be done: and not anything new under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Is there a word will be said, See, this is new? This was already to a long time which was before us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">No remembrance to former things; and also to the latter things that shall be; to them shall be no remembrance with them which shall be for the latter state.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I the preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And I gave my heart to seek and to search out in wisdom concerning all which was done under the heavens: this evil business God gave to the sons of man to be occupied in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I saw all the works they did under the sun; and behold, all vanity and striving of the spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The crooked thing shall not be able to be made straight: and the deficiency shall not be able to be numbered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">It spake with my heart, saying, Behold, I was magnified, and added wisdom over all that were before me at Jerusalem: and my heart saw much of wisdom and knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And I will give my heart to know wisdom, and the knowledge of praise and understanding: I knew this also it is the striving of the spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For in abundance of wisdom, abundance of trouble: and he adding knowledge will increase pain.</p>
