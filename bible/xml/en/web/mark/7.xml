  <verse number="1">Then the Pharisees, and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they found fault.</verse>
  <verse number="3">(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, don’t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders.</verse>
  <verse number="4">They don’t eat when they come from the marketplace, unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.)</verse>
  <verse number="5">The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why don’t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?”</verse>
  <verse number="6">He answered them, “Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, ‘This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’</verse>
  <verse number="8">“For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men—the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things.”</verse>
  <verse number="9">He said to them, “Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother;’ and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">But you say, ‘If a man tells his father or his mother, “Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban, that is to say, given to God;”’</verse>
  <verse number="12">then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,</verse>
  <verse number="13">making void the word of God by your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like this.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them, “Hear me, all of you, and understand.</verse>
  <verse number="15">There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”</verse>
  <verse number="17">When he had entered into a house away from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He said to them, “Are you thus without understanding also? Don’t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can’t defile him,</verse>
  <verse number="19">because it doesn’t go into his heart, but into his stomach, then into the latrine, thus purifying all foods?”</verse>
  <verse number="20">He said, “That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,</verse>
  <verse number="22">covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.</verse>
  <verse number="23">All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.”</verse>
  <verse number="24">From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and didn’t want anyone to know it, but he couldn’t escape notice.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But Jesus said to her, “Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”</verse>
  <verse number="28">But she answered him, “Yes, Lord. Yet even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”</verse>
  <verse number="29">He said to her, “For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter.”</verse>
  <verse number="30">She went away to her house, and found the child having been laid on the bed, with the demon gone out.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the region of Decapolis.</verse>
  <verse number="32">They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, “Ephphatha!” that is, “Be opened!”</verse>
  <verse number="35">Immediately his ears were opened, and the impediment of his tongue was released, and he spoke clearly.</verse>
  <verse number="36">He commanded them that they should tell no one, but the more he commanded them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.</verse>
  <verse number="37">They were astonished beyond measure, saying, “He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!”</verse>
