<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the heavens and the earth shall be completed and all their army.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And God will complete in the seventh day his work which he made, and he will rest in the seventh day from all his work which he made.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And God will praise the seventh day, and will consecrate it, because in it he ceased from all his works which God formed to make.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">These the generations of the heavens and the earth in creating them, in the day of Jehovah Godâ€™s making the earth and the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And every green thing of the field before it shall be in the earth, and every green herb of the field before it will spring up: for Jehovah God rained not upon the earth and not a man to work the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And a vapor shall go up from the earth and it watered all the face of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And Jehovah God will form man of the dust from the earth, and will blow into his nostrils the breath of lives, and man shall be for a living soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Jehovah God will plant a garden in Eden from the east; and he will put there the man which he will form.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Jehovah God will cause to grow out of the earth every tree pleasant to the sight, and good for food; and the tree of lives in the midst of the garden, and the tree to know good and evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And a river shall go out from Eden to water the garden, and from thence it shall be separated into four heads.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The name of the one, Pison: it is that surrounding all the land Havilah, where there is gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the gold of that land is good. There bdellium and onyx stone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the name of the second river, Gihon: that surrounding all the land of Cush.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And the name of the third river, Hiddekel, that going forth east of Assyria. And the fourth river, Euphrates.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Jehovah God will take the man and will set him down in the garden of Eden to work it and to keep it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Jehovah God will appoint to the man, saying, From every tree of the garden eating, thou shalt eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But from the tree to know good and evil thou shalt not eat from it, for in the day of thy eating from it, dying, thou shalt die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Jehovah God will say, It is not good for man to be alone; I will make for him a help as before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Jehovah God will form out of the earth every living thing of the field, and all the birds of the heavens, and he will bring in to the man to see what he will call to it; and all which the man will call it to the living soul, that its name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the man will call the names to all the cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every living thing of the field; but to the man was not found a help as before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Jehovah God will cause to fall a deep sleep upon the man, and he will sleep; and he will take one of his ribs and will close up the flesh underneath it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Jehovah God will build the rib which he took from the man, into a woman, and will bring her to the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And the man will say, This is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh; and this shall be called woman, because she was taken from man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother and will cleave to his woman; and they shall be into one flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And they two shall be naked, the man and his woman, and they shall not be ashamed.</p>
