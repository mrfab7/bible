<p class="verse" data-verse="1">If then ye were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For ye died, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">When Christ, who is our life, shall be manifested, then shall ye also with him be manifested in glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, the which is idolatry;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">for which things’ sake cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">in the which ye also walked aforetime, when ye lived in these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But now put ye also away all these; anger, wrath, malice, railing, shameful speaking out of your mouth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">lie not one to another; seeing that ye have put off the old man with his doings,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto knowledge after the image of him that created him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman: but Christ is all, and in all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Put on therefore, as God’s elect, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any man have a complaint against any; even as the Lord forgave you, so also do ye:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfectness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to the which also ye were called in one body; and be ye thankful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts unto God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And whatsoever ye do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Fathers, provoke not your children, that they be not discouraged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Servants, obey in all things them that are your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as men-pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">whatsoever ye do, work heartily, as unto the Lord, and not unto men;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">knowing that from the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance: ye serve the Lord Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For he that doeth wrong shall receive again for the wrong that he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.</p>
