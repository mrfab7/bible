<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover Elihu answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than Godâ€™s?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For thou hast asked of what profit it is unto thee: what do I gain more than if I had sinned?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I will reply to thee in words, and to thy companions with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Look unto the heavens and see; and survey the skies: they are higher than thou.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? If thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If thou be righteous, what givest thou to him? or what doth he receive of thy hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Thy wickedness [may affect] a man as thou [art], and thy righteousness a son of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry; they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But none saith, Where is +God my Maker, who giveth songs in the night,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowl of the heavens?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">There they cry, and he answereth not, because of the pride of evil men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Although thou sayest thou dost not see him, judgment is before him, therefore wait for him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, doth not [Job] know [his] great arrogancy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For Job hath opened his mouth in vanity, and made words abundant without knowledge.</p>
