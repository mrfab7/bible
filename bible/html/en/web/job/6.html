<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Oh that my anguish were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas, therefore have my words been rash.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For the arrows of the Almighty are within me. My spirit drinks up their poison. The terrors of God set themselves in array against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass? Or does the ox low over his fodder?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Can that which has no flavor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">My soul refuses to touch them. They are as loathsome food to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">“Oh that I might have my request, that God would grant the thing that I long for,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">even that it would please God to crush me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Be it still my consolation, yes, let me exult in pain that doesn’t spare, that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">What is my strength, that I should wait? What is my end, that I should be patient?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of brass?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Isn’t it that I have no help in me, That wisdom is driven quite from me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">“To him who is ready to faint, kindness should be shown from his friend; even to him who forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook, as the channel of brooks that pass away;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Which are black by reason of the ice, in which the snow hides itself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">In the dry season, they vanish. When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The caravans that travel beside them turn aside. They go up into the waste, and perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The caravans of Tema looked. The companies of Sheba waited for them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">They were distressed because they were confident. They came there, and were confounded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For now you are nothing. You see a terror, and are afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Did I say, ‘Give to me?’ or, ‘Offer a present for me from your substance?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">or, ‘Deliver me from the adversary’s hand?’ or, ‘Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">“Teach me, and I will hold my peace. Cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">How forcible are words of uprightness! But your reproof, what does it reprove?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Do you intend to reprove words, since the speeches of one who is desperate are as wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Yes, you would even cast lots for the fatherless, and make merchandise of your friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Now therefore be pleased to look at me, for surely I shall not lie to your face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Please return. Let there be no injustice. Yes, return again. My cause is righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Is there injustice on my tongue? Can’t my taste discern mischievous things?</p>
