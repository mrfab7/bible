<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I saw the Lord standing beside the altar, and he said, “Strike the tops of the pillars, that the thresholds may shake; and break them in pieces on the head of all of them; and I will kill the last of them with the sword: there shall not one of them flee away, and there shall not one of them escape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Though they dig into Sheol, there my hand will take them; and though they climb up to heaven, there I will bring them down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out there; and though they be hidden from my sight in the bottom of the sea, there I will command the serpent, and it will bite them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Though they go into captivity before their enemies, there I will command the sword, and it will kill them. I will set my eyes on them for evil, and not for good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, is he who touches the land and it melts, and all who dwell in it will mourn; and it will rise up wholly like the River, and will sink again, like the River of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">It is he who builds his rooms in the heavens, and has founded his vault on the earth; he who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the surface of the earth; Yahweh is his name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Are you not like the children of the Ethiopians to me, children of Israel?” says Yahweh. “Haven’t I brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Behold, the eyes of the Lord Yahweh are on the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the surface of the earth; except that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob,” says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">“For, behold, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all the nations, as grain is sifted in a sieve, yet not the least kernel will fall on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">All the sinners of my people will die by the sword, who say, ‘Evil won’t overtake nor meet us.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">In that day I will raise up the tent of David who is fallen, and close up its breaches, and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">that they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all the nations who are called by my name,” says Yahweh who does this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">“Behold, the days come,” says Yahweh, “that the plowman shall overtake the reaper, and the one treading grapes him who sows seed; and sweet wine will drip from the mountains, and flow from the hills.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I will bring my people Israel back from captivity, and they will rebuild the ruined cities, and inhabit them; and they will plant vineyards, and drink wine from them. They shall also make gardens, and eat their fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I will plant them on their land, and they will no more be plucked up out of their land which I have given them,” says Yahweh your God.</p>
