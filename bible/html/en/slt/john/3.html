<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And there was a man of the Pharisees, Nicodemus the name to him, a ruler of the Jews:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">He came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou hast come a teacher from God: for none can do these signs which thou doest, except God be with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Jesus answered and said to him, Amen, amen, I say to thee, Except any one be born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Nicodemus says to him, How can a man be born, being an old man? he cannot come in a second time to his mother’s belly, and be born.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Jesus says to him, Truly, truly, I say to thee, Except any one be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot come into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">That born of flesh is flesh; and that born of the Spirit is spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thou shouldest not wonder that I said to thee, Ye must be born from above.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The wind, where it wills, blows, and its voice thou hearest, but thou knowest not whence it comes, and where it goes: so is every one having been born of the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Nicodemus answered and said to him, How can these things be?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Jesus answered and said to him, Art thou a teacher of Israel, and knowest not these?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Truly, truly, I say to thee, that what we know, we speak, and what we have seen we testify; and ye receive not our testimony.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If I spake to you earthly things, and ye believe not, how, if I speak to you heavenly things, will ye believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And none has ascended to heaven, except he having descended from heaven, the Son of man, he being in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so must the Son of man be lifted up;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">That every one believing in him perish not, but have eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only born Son, that every one believing in him perish not, but have eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For God sent not his Son into the world that he judge the world; but that the world might be saved through him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He believing in him is not judged: and he not believing has been already judged, because he has not believed in the name of the only born Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And this is the judgment, that light has come into the world, and men rather loved darkness than light, for their works were evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For every one doing bad things hates the light, and he comes not to the light, lest his works should be rebuked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But he doing the truth comes to the light, that his works might be manifested, that they are wrought in God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">After these Jesus came and his disciples into the Judean land; and there he tarried with them, and immersed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And John was also immersing in Aenon near Salim, for many waters were there: and they came near and were immersed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For John was not yet cast into prison.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Then was there an investigation of John’s disciples with Jesus about purification.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou hast testified, behold, he immerses, and all come to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">John answered and said, No man can receive anything except it be given him from heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Ye yourselves testify to me, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He having the bride is the bridegroom: and the friend of the bridegroom, standing and hearing him, rejoices with joy for the bridegroom’s voice: therefore this my joy has been completed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He must increase, and I must be diminished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">He coming from above is above all, he being of the earth is of earth, and speaks of earth: he coming from heaven is above all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And what he saw and heard, this be testifies: and none receives his testimony.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">He having received his testimony has fixed a seal that God is true.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For he whom God sent speaks the words of God: for God gives not the Spirit by measure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">The Father loves the Son, and he has given all things into his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">He believing in the Son has eternal life: and he not believing the Son shall not see life, but the anger of God remains upon him.</p>
