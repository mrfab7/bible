<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But now they that are younger than I, have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Yes, to what might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age had perished?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them, as after a thief;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">To dwell in the clefts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were collected.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They were children of fools, yes, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And now I am their song, yes, I am their by-word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He hath cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I cry to thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Thou hast become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Yet he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">When I looked for good, then evil came: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction came upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.</p>
