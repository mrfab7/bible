  <verse number="1">THEN shall the kingdom of heaven be like to ten virgins, who taking their lamps went out to meet the bridegroom and the bride.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And five of them were foolish, and five wise.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But the five foolish, having taken their lamps, did not take oil with them:</verse>
  <verse number="4">But the wise took oil in their vessels with the lamps.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the bridegroom tarrying, they all slumbered and slept.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And at midnight there was a cry made: Behold the bridegroom cometh, go ye forth to meet him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the foolish said to the wise: Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The wise answered, saying: Lest perhaps there be not enough for us and for you, go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Now whilst they went to buy, the bridegroom came: and they that were ready, went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But at last come also the other virgins, saying: Lord, Lord, open to us.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But he answering said: Amen I say to you, I know you not.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Watch ye therefore, because you know not the day nor the hour.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For even as a man going into a far country, called his servants, and delivered to them his goods;</verse>
  <verse number="15">And to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to every one according to his proper ability: and immediately he took his journey.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he that had received the five talents, went his way, and traded with the same, and gained other five.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And in like manner he that had received the two, gained other two.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But he that had received the one, going his way digged into the earth, and hid his lord’s money.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reckoned with them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he that had received the five talents coming, brought other five talents, saying: Lord, thou didst deliver to me five talents, behold I have gained other five over and above.</verse>
  <verse number="21">His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant, because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he also that had received the two talents came and said: Lord, thou deliveredst two talents to me: behold I have gained other two.</verse>
  <verse number="23">His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant: because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But he that had received the one talent, came and said: Lord, I know that thou art a hard man; thou reapest where thou hast not sown, and gatherest where thou hast not strewed.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And being afraid I went and hid thy talent in the earth: behold here thou hast that which is thine.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And his lord answering, said to him: Wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sow not, and gather where I have not strewed:</verse>
  <verse number="27">Thou oughtest therefore to have committed my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received my own with usury.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that hath ten talents.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: but from him that hath not, that also which he seemeth to have shall be taken away.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And the unprofitable servant cast ye out into the exterior darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And when the Son of man shall come in his majesty, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And all nations shall be gathered together before him, and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats:</verse>
  <verse number="33">And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Then shall the king say to them that shall be on his right hand: Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="35">For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in:</verse>
  <verse number="36">Naked, and you covered me: sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came to me.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Then shall the just answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and fed thee; thirsty, and gave thee drink?</verse>
  <verse number="38">And when did we see thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and covered thee?</verse>
  <verse number="39">Or when did we see thee sick or in prison, and came to thee?</verse>
  <verse number="40">And the king answering, shall say to them: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand: Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels.</verse>
  <verse number="42">For I was hungry, and you gave me not to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave me not to drink.</verse>
  <verse number="43">I was a stranger, and you took me not in: naked, and you covered me not: sick and in prison, and you did not visit me.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Then they also shall answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee?</verse>
  <verse number="45">Then he shall answer them, saying: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it not to one of these least, neither did you do it to me.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And these shall go into everlasting punishment: but the just, into life everlasting.</verse>
