  <verse number="1">After these events, the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision: “Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your very great reward.”</verse>
  <verse number="2">But Abram replied, “O Lord GOD, what can You give me, since I remain childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of Damascus?”</verse>
  <verse number="3">Abram continued, “Behold, You have given me no offspring, so a servant in my household will be my heir.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then the word of the LORD came to Abram, saying, “This one will not be your heir, but one who comes from your own body will be your heir.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the LORD took him outside and said, “Now look to the heavens and count the stars, if you are able.” Then He told him, “So shall your offspring be.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">Abram believed the LORD, and it was credited to him as righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The LORD also told him, “I am the LORD, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land to possess.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">But Abram replied, “Lord GOD, how can I know that I will possess it?”</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the LORD said to him, “Bring Me a heifer, a goat, and a ram, each three years old, along with a turtledove and a young pigeon.”</verse>
  <verse number="10">So Abram brought all these to Him, split each of them down the middle, and laid the halves opposite each other. The birds, however, he did not cut in half.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the birds of prey descended on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.</verse>
  <verse number="12">As the sun was setting, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and suddenly great terror and darkness overwhelmed him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then the LORD said to Abram, “Know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a land that is not their own, and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But I will judge the nation they serve as slaves, and afterward they will depart with many possessions.</verse>
  <verse number="15">You, however, will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a ripe old age.</verse>
  <verse number="16">In the fourth generation your descendants will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete.”</verse>
  <verse number="17">When the sun had set and darkness had fallen, behold, a smoking firepot and a flaming torch appeared and passed between the halves of the carcasses.</verse>
  <verse number="18">On that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, “To your descendants I have given this land—from the river of Egypt to the great River Euphrates—</verse>
  <verse number="19">the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,</verse>
  <verse number="20">Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,</verse>
  <verse number="21">Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.”</verse>
