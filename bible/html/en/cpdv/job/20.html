<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Zophar the Naamathite answered by saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">In response, various thoughts succeed one another in me, and my mind moves quickly through different ideas.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The teaching you use to admonish me, I will hear, and the spirit of my understanding will respond for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">This, I know, is from the beginning, from the time that man was set over the earth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">that the praise of the impious shall be short, and the joy of the hypocrite lasts only a moment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If his pride ascends even towards the heavens, and his head touches the clouds,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">in the end, he will be destroyed like a trash heap, and those who had seen him will say: “Where is he?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Like a dream that flies away, he will not be found; he will pass away like a nightmare.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The eyes that had seen him, will not see him; no longer will his own place admire him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">His sons will be worn away by poverty, and his own hands will deliver his grief to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">His bones will be filled with the vices of his youth, and they will sleep with him in the dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For, when evil will be sweet in his mouth, he will hide it under his tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He will permit it, and not abandon it, and he will conceal it in his throat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">His bread in his belly will be turned into the venom of snakes within him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The riches that he devours, he will vomit up, and from his stomach God will draw them out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He will suck the head of snakes, and the tongue of the viper will kill him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">(May he never see the streams of the river, the torrents of honey and butter.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He will be repaid for all he has done, yet he will not be consumed; according to the multitude of his schemes, so also will he suffer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For, having broken in, he stripped the poor. He has quickly stolen away a house he did not build.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And yet his stomach will not be satisfied, and when he has the things he desires, he will not be able to possess them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Nothing remained of his portion, and, because of this, nothing will continue of his kind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">When he will be satisfied, he will be constrained; he will seethe, and all anguish will fall upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">May his stomach be filled, so that God may send forth the fury of his wrath to him and may rain down his battle upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He will flee from weapons of iron, and he will fall in an arc of brass,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">which had been drawn and had issued forth from its sheath, glittering in its bitterness: the horrible ones will go forth and approach over him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">All darkness has been hidden in his secrecy. A fire that has not been set will devour him; he will be thrown down and forsaken in his tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The heavens will reveal his sinfulness, and the earth will rise up against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The offspring of his house will be exposed; he will be pulled down in the day of God’s wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the inheritance of his words from the Lord.</p>
