<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Be ye therefore imitators of God, as dearly beloved children;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And walk ye in love, as also Christ loved us, and gave himself for us a gift and sacrifice to God for a smell of sweet odor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And fornication, and all uncleanness, or overreaching, let it not be named with you, as becomes the holy;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And obscenity, and silly discourse, or wit, which things concern not; but rather thankfulness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For this ye are knowing, that every fornicator, or unclean, or covetous person, who is an idolater, has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Let none lead you astray with vain words: for by these things comes the anger of God upon the sons of disobedience.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Be ye not therefore partakers with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For ye were then darkness, and now light in the Lord: walk ye as children of light:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">(For the fruit of the Spirit in all goodness and justice and truth;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Trying what is pleasing to the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And participate not with the unfruitful works of darkness, and rather also confute.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For the things done secretly by them it is also shameful to speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And all things refuted, by light are made manifest: for everything made manifest is light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Wherefore he says, Awake, who sleeping, and arise from the dead, and Christ will enlighten thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">See therefore how ye walk accurately, not as unwise, but as wise,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Making purchase of time, for the days are evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For this be not foolish, but understanding what the will of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And be not drunk with wine, in which is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Speaking to yourselves on harps, and songs, and spiritual odes, singing and playing on the harp in your heart to the Lord;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God and the Father;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Yielding obedience to one another in the fear of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Women, yield ye obedience to your own husbands, as to the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For the husband is the head of the wife, as also Christ the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But as the church is subjected to Christ, so also wives to their own husbands in everything.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Husbands, love your own wives, as also Christ loved the church, and delivered himself up for it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">That he might consecrate it, having cleansed by the washing of water in the word,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing: but that it be holy and blameless.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">So ought men to love their own wives as their own bodies. He loving his wife, loves himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For none at any time hates his own flesh; but brings it up and cherishes it, as also the Lord the church:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For this a man shall leave his father and mother, and be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">This is a great mystery: but I speak to Christ and to the church.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">But ye also altogether, let each so love his own wife as himself: and the wife that she fear her husband.</p>
