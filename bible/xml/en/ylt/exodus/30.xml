  <verse number="1">And thou hast made an altar for making perfume; of shittim wood thou dost make it;</verse>
  <verse number="2">a cubit its length, and a cubit its breadth, (it is square), and two cubits its height; its horns are of the same.</verse>
  <verse number="3">‘And thou hast overlaid it with pure gold, its top, and its sides round about, and its horns; and thou hast made to it a crown of gold round about;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and two rings of gold thou dost make to it under its crown; on its two ribs thou dost make them, on its two sides, and they have become places for staves, to bear it with them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">‘And thou hast made the staves of shittim wood, and hast overlaid them with gold;</verse>
  <verse number="6">and thou hast put it before the vail, which is by the ark of the testimony, before the mercy-seat which is over the testimony, whither I am met with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="7">‘And Aaron hath made perfume on it, perfume of spices, morning by morning; in his making the lamps right he doth perfume it,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and in Aaron’s causing the lamps to go up between the evenings, he doth perfume it; a continual perfume before Jehovah to your generations.</verse>
  <verse number="9">‘Ye do not cause strange perfume to go up upon it, and burnt-offering, and present, and libation ye do not pour out on it;</verse>
  <verse number="10">and Aaron hath made atonement on its horns, once in a year, by the blood of the sin-offering of atonements; once in a year doth he make atonement for it, to your generations; it is most holy to Jehovah.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="12">When thou takest up the sum of the sons of Israel for their numbers, then they have given each an atonement for his soul to Jehovah in their being numbered, and there is no plague among them in their being numbered.</verse>
  <verse number="13">This they do give, every one passing over unto those numbered, half a shekel, by the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs); half a shekel is the heave-offering to Jehovah;</verse>
  <verse number="14">every one passing over unto those numbered, from a son of twenty years and upwards, doth give the heave-offering of Jehovah;</verse>
  <verse number="15">the rich doth not multiply, and the poor doth not diminish from the half-shekel, to give the heave-offering of Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.</verse>
  <verse number="16">‘And thou hast taken the atonement-money from the sons of Israel, and hast given it for the service of the tent of meeting; and it hath been to the sons of Israel for a memorial before Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.’</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="18">‘And thou hast made a laver of brass (and its base of brass), for washing; and thou hast put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and hast put water there;</verse>
  <verse number="19">and Aaron and his sons have washed at it their hands and their feet,</verse>
  <verse number="20">in their going in unto the tent of meeting they wash with water, and die not; or in their drawing nigh unto the altar to minister, to perfume a fire-offering to Jehovah,</verse>
  <verse number="21">then they have washed their hands and their feet, and they die not, and it hath been to them a statute age-during, to him and to his seed to their generations.’</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="23">And thou, take to thyself principal spices, wild honey five hundred shekels; and spice-cinnamon, the half of that, two hundred and fifty; and spice-cane two hundred and fifty;</verse>
  <verse number="24">and cassia five hundred, by the shekel of the sanctuary, and olive oil a hin;</verse>
  <verse number="25">and thou hast made it a holy anointing oil, a compound mixture, work of a compounder; it is a holy anointing oil.</verse>
  <verse number="26">‘And thou hast anointed with it the tent of meeting, and the ark of the testimony,</verse>
  <verse number="27">and the table and all its vessels, and the candlestick and its vessels, and the altar of perfume,</verse>
  <verse number="28">and the altar of burnt-offering and all its vessels, and the laver and its base;</verse>
  <verse number="29">and thou hast sanctified them, and they have been most holy; all that is coming against them is holy;</verse>
  <verse number="30">and Aaron and his sons thou dost anoint, and hast sanctified them for being priests to Me.</verse>
  <verse number="31">‘And unto the sons of Israel thou dost speak, saying, A holy anointing oil is this to Me, to your generations;</verse>
  <verse number="32">on flesh of man it is not poured, and with its proper proportion ye make none like it; it is holy; it is holy to you;</verse>
  <verse number="33">a man who compoundeth any like it, or who putteth of it on a stranger—hath even been cut off from his people.’</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Jehovah saith unto Moses, ‘Take to thee spices, stacte, and onycha, and galbanum, spices and pure frankincense; they are part for part;</verse>
  <verse number="35">and thou hast made it a perfume, a compound, work of a compounder, salted, pure, holy;</verse>
  <verse number="36">and thou hast beaten some of it small, and hast put of it before the testimony, in the tent of meeting, whither I am met with thee; most holy it is to you.</verse>
  <verse number="37">‘As to the perfume which thou makest, with its proper proportion ye do not make to yourselves, holy it is to thee to Jehovah;</verse>
  <verse number="38">a man who maketh any like it—to be refreshed by it—hath even been cut off from his people.’</verse>
