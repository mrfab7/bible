<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As God lives, who has taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who has vexed my soul;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove my integrity from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Let my enemy be as the wicked, and he that rises up against me as the unrighteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he has gained, when God takes away his soul?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call on God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Behold, all you yourselves have seen it; why then are you thus altogether vain?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He builds his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper makes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he opens his eyes, and he is not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest steals him away in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The east wind carries him away, and he departs: and as a storm hurles him out of his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For God shall cast on him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.</p>
