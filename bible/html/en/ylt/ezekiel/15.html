<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">‘Son of man, What is the vine-tree more than any tree? The vine-branch that hath been, Among trees of the forest?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is wood taken from it to use for work? Do they take of it a pin to hang any vessel on it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Lo, to the fire it hath been given for fuel, Its two ends hath the fire eaten, And its midst hath been scorched! Is it profitable for work?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Lo, in its being perfect it is not used for work, How much less, when fire hath eaten of it, And it is scorched, Hath it been used yet for work?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: As the vine-tree among trees of the forest, That I have given to the fire for fuel, So I have given the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I have set My face against them, From the fire they have gone forth, And the fire doth consume them, And ye have known that I am Jehovah, In My setting My face against them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And I have made the land a desolation, Because they have committed a trespass, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah!’</p>
