<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Job also added, taking up his parable, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Who will grant me, that I might be according to the months past, according to the days in which God kept me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">When his lamp shined over my head, and I walked by his light in darkness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">As I was in the days of my youth, when God was secretly in my tabernacle?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">When the Almighty was with me: and my servants round about me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When I washed my feet with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When I went out to the gate of the city, and in the street they prepared me a chair?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the old men rose up and stood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The princes ceased to speak, and laid the finger on their mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The rulers held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to their throat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The ear that heard me blessed me, and the eye that saw me gave witness to me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Because I had delivered the poor man that cried out; and the fatherless that had no helper.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me, and I comforted the heart of the widow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I was clad with justice: and I clothed myself with my judgment, as with a robe and a diadem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I was an eye to the blind, and a foot to the lame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I was the father of the poor: and the cause which I knew not, I searched out most diligently.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I broke the jaws of the wicked man, and out of his teeth I took away the prey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And I said: I shall die in my nest, and as a palm tree shall multiply my days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">My root is opened beside the waters, and dew shall continue in my harvest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My glory shall always be renewed, and my bow in my hand shall be repaired.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">They that heard me, waited for my sentence, and being attentive held their peace at my counsel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">To my words they durst add nothing, and my speech dropped upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">They waited for me as for rain, and they opened their mouth as for a latter shower.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">If at any time I laughed on them, they believed not, and the light of my countenance fell not on earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If I had a mind to go to them, I sat first, and when I sat as a king, with his army standing about him, yet I was a comforter of them that mourned.</p>
