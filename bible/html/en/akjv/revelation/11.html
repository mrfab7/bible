<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And there was given me a reed like to a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given to the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days, clothed in sackcloth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And if any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth, and devours their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And they that dwell on the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelled on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet; and great fear fell on them which saw them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And they heard a great voice from heaven saying to them, Come up here. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe comes quickly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell on their faces, and worshipped God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Saying, We give you thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which are, and were, and are to come; because you have taken to you your great power, and have reigned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the nations were angry, and your wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that you should give reward to your servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear your name, small and great; and should destroy them which destroy the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightning, and voices, and thunder, and an earthquake, and great hail.</p>
