  <verse number="1">I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys.</verse>
  <verse number="2">As a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.</verse>
  <verse number="3">As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, his fruit was sweet to my taste.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He brought me to the banquet hall. His banner over me is love.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Strengthen me with raisins, refresh me with apples; For I am faint with love.</verse>
  <verse number="6">His left hand is under my head. His right hand embraces me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, or by the hinds of the field, that you not stir up, nor awaken love, until it so desires.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The voice of my beloved! Behold, he comes, leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills.</verse>
  <verse number="9">My beloved is like a roe or a young hart. Behold, he stands behind our wall! He looks in at the windows. He glances through the lattice.</verse>
  <verse number="10">My beloved spoke, and said to me, “Rise up, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For, behold, the winter is past. The rain is over and gone.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The flowers appear on the earth. The time of the singing has come, and the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The fig tree ripens her green figs. The vines are in blossom. They give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come away.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">My dove in the clefts of the rock, In the hiding places of the mountainside, Let me see your face. Let me hear your voice; for your voice is sweet, and your face is lovely.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Catch for us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vineyards; for our vineyards are in blossom.</verse>
  <verse number="16">My beloved is mine, and I am his. He browses among the lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Until the day is cool, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be like a roe or a young hart on the mountains of Bether.</verse>
