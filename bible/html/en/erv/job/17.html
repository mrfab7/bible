<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="17" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct, the grave is ready for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Surely there are mockers with me, and mine eye abideth in their provocation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Give now a pledge, be surety for me with thyself; who is there that will strike hands with me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He that denounceth his friends for a prey, even the eyes of his children shall fail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He hath made me also a byword of the people; and I am become an open abhorring.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Yet shall the righteous hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But return ye, all of you, and come now: and I shall not find a wise man among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the droughts of my heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They change the night into a day: the fight, say they, is near unto the darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I look for Sheol as mine house; if I have spread my couch in the darkness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If I have said to corruption, Thou art my father; to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Where then is my hope? and as for my hope, who shall see it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">It shall go down to the bars of Sheol, when once there is rest in the dust.</p>
