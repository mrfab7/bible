<div class="chapter" data-book="Ephesians" data-chapter="5" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Therefore, as most beloved sons, be imitators of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And walk in love, just as Christ also loved us and delivered himself for us, as an oblation and a sacrifice to God, with a fragrance of sweetness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But let not any kind of fornication, or impurity, or rapacity so much as be named among you, just as is worthy of the saints,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">nor any indecent, or foolish, or abusive talk, for this is without purpose; but instead, give thanks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For know and understand this: no one who is a fornicator, or lustful, or rapacious (for these are a kind of service to idols) holds an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Let no one seduce you with empty words. For because of these things, the wrath of God was sent upon the sons of unbelief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Therefore, do not choose to become participants with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For you were darkness, in times past, but now you are light, in the Lord. So then, walk as sons of the light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For the fruit of the light is in all goodness and justice and truth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">affirming what is well-pleasing to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And so, have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead, refute them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For the things that are done by them in secret are shameful, even to mention.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But all things that are disputed are made manifest by the light. For all that is made manifest is light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Because of this, it is said: “You who are sleeping: awaken, and rise up from the dead, and so shall the Christ enlighten you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And so, brothers, see to it that you walk cautiously, not like the foolish,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">but like the wise: atoning for this age, because this is an evil time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For this reason, do not choose to be imprudent. Instead, understand what is the will of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And do not choose to be inebriated by wine, for this is self-indulgence. Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">speaking among yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual canticles, singing and reciting psalms to the Lord in your hearts,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">giving thanks always for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Be subject to one another in the fear of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Wives should be submissive to their husbands, as to the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For the husband is the head of the wife, just as Christ is the head of the Church. He is the Savior of his body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Therefore, just as the Church is subject to Christ, so also should wives be subject to their husbands in all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the Church and handed himself over for her,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">so that he might sanctify her, washing her clean by water and the Word of life,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">so that he might offer her to himself as a glorious Church, not having any spot or wrinkle or any such thing, so that she would be holy and immaculate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">So, too, husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For no man has ever hated his own flesh, but instead he nourishes and cherishes it, as Christ also does to the Church.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">For we are a part of his body, of his flesh and of his bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">“For this reason, a man shall leave behind his father and mother, and he shall cling to his wife; and the two shall be as one flesh.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">This is a great Sacrament. And I am speaking in Christ and in the Church.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Yet truly, each and every one of you should love his wife as himself. And a wife should fear her husband.</p>
