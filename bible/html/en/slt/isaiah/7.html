<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="7" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And it will be in the days of Ahaz son of Jotham son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin, king of Aram came up, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, to Jerusalem, to war against her, and he was not able to fight against her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it will be announced to the house of David, saying, Aram rested upon Ephraim; and his heart will move to and fro and the heart of his people, as the woods of the forest moved from the face of the wind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Jehovah will say to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou and Shear-Jashub thy son, at the extremity of the channel of the highest pool of the highway, of the fuller’s field;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And say to him, Watch and rest; thou shalt not fear, and thy heart shall not be tender from the two tails of these smoking fire-brands, upon the heat of anger of Rezin and Aram, and the son of Remaliah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Because Aram, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, will counsel evil against thee, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">We will go up against Judah and terrify her and subdue her for us, and we will make a king in the midst of her, the son of Tabeal:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thus said the Lord Jehovah, It shall not stand, and it shall not be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For the head of Aram, Damascus, and the head of Damascus, Rezin, and in yet sixty and five years Ephraim shall be broken from a people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the head of Ephraim, Shomeron, and the head of Shomeron, the son of Remaliah. If ye will not believe, because ye will not believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Jehovah will add to speak to Ahaz, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Ask for thee a sign from Jehovah thy God; make deep the asking, or make high upwards.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Ahaz will say, I will not ask and I will not tempt Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And he will say, Hear ye now, house of David; is it small for you to weary men, but will ye weary God also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For this, Jehovah he will give to you a sign Behold, the virgin conceiving, and she will bare a son, and call his name Immanuel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Curdled milk and honey he shall eat, for his knowing to reject in evil, and to choose in good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For before the boy shall know to reject in evil and to choose in good the land which thou abhorrest shall be forsaken from the face of its two kings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Jehovah shall bring upon thee and upon thy people, and upon thy father’s house, days which came not, from the day Ephraim turned away from Judah; the king of Assur.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And it was in that day Jehovah shall hiss for the fly which is in the extremity of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee which is in the land of Assur.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And they shall come and rest all of them in the valleys, and in the clefts of the rocks, and in all the thorn hedges, and in all pastures.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In that day shall Jehovah shave with a hired razor by those beyond the river, by the king of Assur, the head and the hair of the feet: and it also shall scrape off the beard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And it was in, that day a man shall preserve alive a heifer of the herd, and two sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And it was from the abundance of making milk he shall eat curdled milk; for curdled milk and honey shall eat all they being left in the midst of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And it was in that day every place shall be where shall be there a thousand vines for a thousand of silver, for sharp points and thorns shall it be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">With arrows and with bows shall he come there: for sharp points and thorns shall be all the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And all the mountains which shall be dressed with the hoe, the fear of sharp points and thorns shall not come there: and it was for the sending forth of the ox and for the treading of sheep.</p>
