  <verse number="1">So they arrived at the opposite shore of the Lake, in the country of the Gerasenes.</verse>
  <verse number="2">At once, on His landing, there came from the tombs to meet Him a man possessed by a foul spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="3">This man lived among the tombs, nor could any one now secure him even with a chain;</verse>
  <verse number="4">for many a time he had been left securely bound in fetters and chains, but afterwards the chains lay torn link from link, and the fetters in fragments, and there was no one strong enough to master him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And constantly, day and night, he remained among the tombs or on the hills, shrieking, and mangling himself with sharp stones.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And when he saw Jesus in the distance, he ran and threw himself at His feet,</verse>
  <verse number="7">crying out in a loud voice, “What hast Thou to do with me, Jesus, Son of God Most High? In God’s name I implore Thee not to torment me.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">For He had said to him, “Foul spirit, come out of the man.”</verse>
  <verse number="9">Jesus also questioned him. “What is your name?” He said. “Legion,” he replied, “for there are a host of us.”</verse>
  <verse number="10">And he earnestly entreated Him not to send them away out of the country.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Feeding there, on the mountain slope, was a great herd of swine.</verse>
  <verse number="12">So they besought Jesus. “Send us to the swine,” they said, “so that we may enter into them.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">He gave them leave; and the foul spirits came out and entered into the swine, and the herd—about 2,000 in number—rushed headlong down the cliff into the Lake and were drowned in the Lake.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The swineherds fled, and spread the news in town and country. So the people came to see what it was that had happened;</verse>
  <verse number="15">and when they came to Jesus, they beheld the demoniac quietly seated, clothed and of sane mind—the man who had had the legion; and they were awe-stricken.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And those who had seen it told them the particulars of what had happened to the demoniac, and all about the swine.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Then they began entreating Him to depart from their district.</verse>
  <verse number="18">As He was embarking, the man who had been possessed asked permission to accompany Him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But He would not allow it. “Go home to your family,” He said, “and report to them all that the Lord has done for you, and the mercy He has shown you.”</verse>
  <verse number="20">So the man departed, and related publicly everywhere in the Ten Towns all that Jesus had done for him; and all were astonished.</verse>
  <verse number="21">When Jesus had re-crossed in the boat to the other side, a vast multitude came crowding to Him; and He was on the shore of the Lake,</verse>
  <verse number="22">when there came one of the Wardens of the Synagogue—he was called Jair—who, on beholding Him, threw himself at His feet,</verse>
  <verse number="23">and besought Him with many entreaties. “My little daughter,” he said, “is at the point of death: I pray you come and lay your hands upon her, that she may recover and live.”</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Jesus went with him. And a dense crowd followed Him, and thronged Him on all sides.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Now a woman who for twelve years had suffered from haemorrhage,</verse>
  <verse number="26">and had undergone many different treatments under a number of doctors and had spent all she had without receiving benefit but on the contrary growing worse,</verse>
  <verse number="27">heard of Jesus. And she came in the crowd behind Him and touched His cloak;</verse>
  <verse number="28">for she said, “If I but touch His clothes, I shall be cured.”</verse>
  <verse number="29">In a moment the flow of her blood ceased, and she felt in herself that her complaint was cured.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Immediately Jesus, well knowing that healing power had gone from within Him, turned round in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my clothes?”</verse>
  <verse number="31">“You see the multitude pressing you on all sides,” His disciples exclaimed, “and yet you ask, ‘Who touched me?’”</verse>
  <verse number="32">But He continued looking about to see the person who had done this,</verse>
  <verse number="33">until the woman, frightened and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and threw herself at His feet, and told Him all the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="34">“Daughter,” He said, “your faith has cured you: go in peace, and be free from your complaint.”</verse>
  <verse number="35">While He is yet speaking, men come from the house to the Warden, and say, “Your daughter is dead: why trouble the Rabbi further?”</verse>
  <verse number="36">But Jesus, overhearing the words, said to the Warden, “Do not be afraid; only have faith.”</verse>
  <verse number="37">And He allowed no one to accompany Him except Peter and the brothers James and John.</verse>
  <verse number="38">So they come to the Warden’s house. Here He gazes on a scene of uproar, with people weeping aloud and wailing.</verse>
  <verse number="39">He goes in. “Why all this outcry and loud weeping?” He asks; “the child is asleep, not dead.”</verse>
  <verse number="40">To this their reply is a scornful laugh. He, however, puts them all out, takes the child’s father and mother and those He has brought with Him, and enters the room where the child lies.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Then, taking her by the hand, He says to her, “Talitha, koum;” that is to say, “Little girl, I command you to wake!”</verse>
  <verse number="42">Instantly the little girl rises to her feet and begins to walk (for she was twelve years old)</verse>
  <verse number="43">but He gave strict injunctions that the matter should not be made known, and directed them to give her something to eat.</verse>
