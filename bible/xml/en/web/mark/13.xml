  <verse number="1">As he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Teacher, see what kind of stones and what kind of buildings!”</verse>
  <verse number="2">Jesus said to him, “Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone on another, which will not be thrown down.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,</verse>
  <verse number="4">“Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign that these things are all about to be fulfilled?”</verse>
  <verse number="5">Jesus, answering, began to tell them, “Be careful that no one leads you astray.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he!’ and will lead many astray.</verse>
  <verse number="7">“When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, don’t be troubled. For those must happen, but the end is not yet.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places. There will be famines and troubles. These things are the beginning of birth pains.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But watch yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils. You will be beaten in synagogues. You will stand before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The Good News must first be preached to all the nations.</verse>
  <verse number="11">When they lead you away and deliver you up, don’t be anxious beforehand, or premeditate what you will say, but say whatever will be given you in that hour. For it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="12">“Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="13">You will be hated by all men for my name’s sake, but he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But when you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains,</verse>
  <verse number="15">and let him who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter in, to take anything out of his house.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Let him who is in the field not return back to take his cloak.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse babies in those days!</verse>
  <verse number="18">Pray that your flight won’t be in the winter.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For in those days there will be oppression, such as there has not been the like from the beginning of the creation which God created until now, and never will be.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Unless the Lord had shortened the days, no flesh would have been saved; but for the sake of the chosen ones, whom he picked out, he shortened the days.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then if anyone tells you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or, ‘Look, there!’ don’t believe it.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For there will arise false christs and false prophets, and will show signs and wonders, that they may lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But you watch. “Behold, I have told you all things beforehand.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But in those days, after that oppression, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light,</verse>
  <verse number="25">the stars will be falling from the sky, and the powers that are in the heavens will be shaken.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Then he will send out his angels, and will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the sky.</verse>
  <verse number="28">“Now from the fig tree, learn this parable. When the branch has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near;</verse>
  <verse number="29">even so you also, when you see these things coming to pass, know that it is near, at the doors.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Most certainly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things happen.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But of that day or that hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Watch, keep alert, and pray; for you don’t know when the time is.</verse>
  <verse number="34">“It is like a man, traveling to another country, having left his house, and given authority to his servants, and to each one his work, and also commanded the doorkeeper to keep watch.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Watch therefore, for you don’t know when the lord of the house is coming, whether at evening, or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning;</verse>
  <verse number="36">lest coming suddenly he might find you sleeping.</verse>
  <verse number="37">What I tell you, I tell all: Watch.”</verse>
