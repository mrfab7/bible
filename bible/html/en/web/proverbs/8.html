<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="8" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Doesn’t wisdom cry out? Doesn’t understanding raise her voice?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">On the top of high places by the way, where the paths meet, she stands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, at the entry doors, she cries aloud:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">“To you men, I call! I send my voice to the sons of mankind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">You simple, understand prudence. You fools, be of an understanding heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Hear, for I will speak excellent things. The opening of my lips is for right things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For my mouth speaks truth. Wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">All the words of my mouth are in righteousness. There is nothing crooked or perverse in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They are all plain to him who understands, right to those who find knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Receive my instruction rather than silver; knowledge rather than choice gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For wisdom is better than rubies. All the things that may be desired can’t be compared to it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">“I, wisdom, have made prudence my dwelling. Find out knowledge and discretion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The fear of Yahweh is to hate evil. I hate pride, arrogance, the evil way, and the perverse mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Counsel and sound knowledge are mine. I have understanding and power.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">By me princes rule; nobles, and all the righteous rulers of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I love those who love me. Those who seek me diligently will find me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">With me are riches, honor, enduring wealth, and prosperity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold; my yield than choice silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of justice;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">That I may give wealth to those who love me. I fill their treasuries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">“Yahweh possessed me in the beginning of his work, before his deeds of old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, before the earth existed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">When there were no depths, I was brought forth, when there were no springs abounding with water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Before the mountains were settled in place, before the hills, I was brought forth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the beginning of the dust of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">When he established the heavens, I was there; when he set a circle on the surface of the deep,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">when he established the clouds above, when the springs of the deep became strong,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">when he gave to the sea its boundary, that the waters should not violate his commandment, when he marked out the foundations of the earth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">then I was the craftsman by his side. I was a delight day by day, always rejoicing before him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Rejoicing in his whole world. My delight was with the sons of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">“Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, for blessed are those who keep my ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Hear instruction, and be wise. Don’t refuse it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Blessed is the man who hears me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at my door posts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">For whoever finds me, finds life, and will obtain favor from Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">But he who sins against me wrongs his own soul. All those who hate me love death.”</p>
