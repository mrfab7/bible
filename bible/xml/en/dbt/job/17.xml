  <verse number="1">My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are mine.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Are there not mockers around me? and doth [not] mine eye abide in their provocation?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Lay down now [a pledge], be thou surety for me with thyself: who is he that striketh hands with me?</verse>
  <verse number="4">For thou hast hidden their heart from understanding; therefore thou wilt not exalt [them].</verse>
  <verse number="5">He that betrayeth friends for a prey—even the eyes of his children shall fail.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he hath made me a proverb of the peoples; and I am become one to be spit on in the face.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And mine eye is dim by reason of grief, and all my members are as a shadow.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Upright men [shall be] astonished at this, and the innocent shall be stirred up against the ungodly;</verse>
  <verse number="9">But the righteous shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall increase in strength.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But as for you all, pray come on again; and I shall not find one wise man among you.</verse>
  <verse number="11">My days are past, my purposes are broken off, the cherished thoughts of my heart.</verse>
  <verse number="12">They change the night into day; the light [they imagine] near in presence of the darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If I wait, Sheol is my house; I spread my bed in the darkness:</verse>
  <verse number="14">I cry to the grave, Thou art my father! to the worm, My mother, and my sister!</verse>
  <verse number="15">And where is then my hope? yea, my hope, who shall see it?</verse>
  <verse number="16">It shall go down to the bars of Sheol, when [our] rest shall be together in the dust.</verse>
