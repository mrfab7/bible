  <verse number="1">I commend unto you Phoebe our sister, who is a servant of the church that is at Cenchreae:</verse>
  <verse number="2">that ye receive her in the Lord, worthily of the saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever matter she may have need of you: for she herself also hath been a succourer of many, and of mine own self.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Salute Prisca and Aquila my fellow-workers in Christ Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="4">who for my life laid down their own necks; unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles:</verse>
  <verse number="5">and salute the church that is in their house. Salute Epaenetus my beloved, who is the firstfruits of Asia unto Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Salute Mary, who bestowed much labour on you.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Salute Andronicus and Junias, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also have been in Christ before me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Salute Ampliatus my beloved in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Salute Urbanus our fellow-worker in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Salute Apelles the approved in Christ. Salute them which are of the household of Aristobulus.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Salute Herodion my kinsman. Salute them of the household of Narcissus, which are in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Salute Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute Persis the beloved, which laboured much in the Lord.</verse>

  <verse number="16">Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ salute you.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which are causing the divisions and occasions of stumbling, contrary to the doctrine which ye learned: and turn away from them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For they that are such serve not our Lord Christ, but their own belly; and by their smooth and fair speech they beguile the hearts of the innocent.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For your obedience is come abroad unto all men. I rejoice therefore over you: but I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple unto that which is evil.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</verse>

  <verse number="23">Gaius my host, and of the whole church, saluteth you. Erastus the treasurer of the city saluteth you, and Quartus the brother.</verse>
  <verse number="24"></verse>
  <verse number="25">Now to him that is able to stablish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which hath been kept in silence through times eternal,</verse>
  <verse number="26">but now is manifested, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made known unto all the nations unto obedience of faith;</verse>
  <verse number="27">to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory for ever. Amen.</verse>
