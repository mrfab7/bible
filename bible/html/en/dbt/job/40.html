<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah answered Job and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Shall he that will contend with the Almighty instruct [him]? he that reproveth +God, let him answer it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Job answered Jehovah and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Behold, I am nought: what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; yea twice, but I will proceed no further.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Gird up now thy loins like a man: I will demand of thee, and inform thou me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Wilt thou also annul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me that thou mayest be righteous?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Deck thyself now with glory and excellency, and clothe thyself with majesty and splendour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Cast abroad the ragings of thine anger, and look on every one that is proud, and abase him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Look on every one that is proud, bring him low, and tread down the wicked in their place:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in secret.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then will I also praise thee, because thy right hand saveth thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">See now the behemoth, which I made with thee: he eateth grass as an ox.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Behold now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the muscles of his belly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He bendeth his tail like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are woven together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">His bones are tubes of bronze, his members are like bars of iron.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He is the chief of God’s ways: he that made him gave him his sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He lieth under lotus-bushes, in the covert of the reed and fen:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Lotus-bushes cover him with their shade; the willows of the brook surround him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Lo, the river overfloweth—he startleth not: he is confident though a Jordan break forth against his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Shall he be taken in front? will they pierce through [his] nose in the trap?</p>
