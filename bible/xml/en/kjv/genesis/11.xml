  <verse number="1">And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top [may reach] unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the LORD said, Behold, the people [is] one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.</verse>
  <verse number="8">So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</verse>
