<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For the transgression of a land many [are] the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding [and] knowledge the state [thereof] shall be prolonged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A poor man that oppresseth the poor [is like] a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all [things].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Better [is] the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than [he that is] perverse [in his] ways, though he [be] rich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Whoso keepeth the law [is] a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous [men] shameth his father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer [shall be] abomination.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good [things] in possession.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The rich man [is] wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When righteous [men] do rejoice, [there is] great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh [them] shall have mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Happy [is] the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">[As] a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; [so is] a wicked ruler over the poor people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The prince that wanteth understanding [is] also a great oppressor: [but] he that hateth covetousness shall prolong [his] days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A man that doeth violence to the blood of [any] person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but [he that is] perverse [in his] ways shall fall at once.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain [persons] shall have poverty enough.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">To have respect of persons [is] not good: for for a piece of bread [that] man will transgress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He that hasteth to be rich [hath] an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, [It is] no transgression; the same [is] the companion of a destroyer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.</p>
