<p class="verse" data-verse="1">For this reason I Paul, prisoner of the Christ Jesus for you nations,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">(if indeed ye have heard of the administration of the grace of God which has been given to me towards you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">that by revelation the mystery has been made known to me, (according as I have written before briefly,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">by which, in reading it, ye can understand my intelligence in the mystery of the Christ,)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">which in other generations has not been made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in [the power of the] Spirit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">that [they who are of] the nations should be joint heirs, and a joint body, and joint partakers of [his] promise in Christ Jesus by the glad tidings;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">of which I am become minister according to the gift of the grace of God given to me, according to the working of his power.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">To me, less than the least of all saints, has this grace been given, to announce among the nations the glad tidings of the unsearchable riches of the Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and to enlighten all [with the knowledge of] what is the administration of the mystery hidden throughout the ages in God, who has created all things,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">in order that now to the principalities and authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the assembly the all-various wisdom of God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">according to [the] purpose of the ages, which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">in whom we have boldness and access in confidence by the faith of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Wherefore I beseech [you] not to faint through my tribulations for you, which is your glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For this reason I bow my knees to the Father [of our Lord Jesus Christ],</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">of whom every family in [the] heavens and on earth is named,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">in order that he may give you according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">that the Christ may dwell, through faith, in your hearts, being rooted and founded in love,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">in order that ye may be fully able to apprehend with all the saints what [is] the breadth and length and depth and height;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and to know the love of the Christ which surpasses knowledge; that ye may be filled [even] to all the fulness of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But to him that is able to do far exceedingly above all which we ask or think, according to the power which works in us,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">to him be glory in the assembly in Christ Jesus unto all generations of the age of ages. Amen).</p>
