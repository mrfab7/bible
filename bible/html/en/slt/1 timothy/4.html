<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the Spirit says expressly, that in later times some shall be removed from the faith, holding to deceitful spirits, and doctrines of evil spirits;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">In the hypocrisy of speaking falsely; burned with a hot iron in their own consciousness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Hindering to marry, to keep from victuals which God created for participation, with thanks, for the faithful and them knowing the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For every created thing of God good, and nothing thrown away, received with thanks:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For it is consecrated by the word of God and entreaty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">These having laid down to the brethren, thou shalt be a good servant of Jesus Christ, brought up in the words of faith and good doctrine, which thou hast closely followed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And profane and old womenâ€™s fictions reject, and exercise thyself in devotion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For bodily exercise is profitable, to little: but devotion is profitable to all things, having promise of life now, and that about to be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Faithful the word, and worthy of all acceptance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For, for this also we are wearied and reproached, that we have hoped in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, chiefly of the faithful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Proclaim and teach these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let none despise thy youth; but be thou a type of the faithful, in word, in intercourse, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Till I come, hold to reading loud, to entreaty, to doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Neglect not the power which in thee, which was given thee by the gift of prophecy, with the putting on of hands of the council of elders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Bestow diligent care upon these things; be in them; that thy progress may be manifest in all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Take heed to thyself, and to the doctrine; remain in them: for doing this, and thou shalt save thyself, and them hearing thee.</p>
