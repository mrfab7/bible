  <verse number="1">Now Saul, whose every breath was a threat of destruction for the disciples of the Lord,</verse>
  <verse number="2">went to the High Priest and begged from him letters addressed to the synagogues in Damascus, in order that if he found any believers there, either men or women, he might bring them in chains to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But on the journey, as he was getting near Damascus, suddenly there flashed round him a light from Heaven;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and falling to the ground he heard a voice which said to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?”</verse>
  <verse number="5">“Who art thou, Lord?” he asked. “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,” was the reply.</verse>
  <verse number="6">“But rise and go to the city, and you will be told what you are to do.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Meanwhile the men who travelled with Saul were standing dumb with amazement, hearing a sound, but seeing no one.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then he rose from the ground, but when he had opened his eyes, he could not see, and they led him by the arm and brought him to Damascus.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And for two days he remained without sight, and did not eat or drink anything.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Now in Damascus there was a disciple of the name of Ananias. The Lord spoke to him in a vision, saying, “Ananias!” “I am here, Lord,” he answered.</verse>
  <verse number="11">“Rise,” said the Lord, “and go to Straight Street, and inquire at the house of Judas for a man called Saul, from Tarsus, for he is actually praying.</verse>
  <verse number="12">He has seen a man called Ananias come and lay his hands upon him so that he may recover his sight.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">“Lord,” answered Ananias, “I have heard about that man from many, and I have heard of the great mischief he has done to Thy people in Jerusalem;</verse>
  <verse number="14">and here he is authorized by the High Priests to arrest all who call upon Thy name.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">“Go,” replied the Lord; “he is a chosen instrument of Mine to carry My name to the Gentiles and to kings and to the descendants of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For I will let him know the great sufferings which he must pass through for My sake.”</verse>
  <verse number="17">So Ananias went and entered the house; and, laying his two hands upon Saul, said, “Saul, brother, the Lord—even Jesus who appeared to you on your journey—has sent me, that you may recover your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”</verse>
  <verse number="18">Instantly there dropped from his eyes what seemed to be scales, and he could see once more. Upon this he rose and received baptism;</verse>
  <verse number="19">after which he took food and regained his strength. Then he remained some little time with the disciples in Damascus.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And in the synagogues he began at once to proclaim Jesus as the Son of God;</verse>
  <verse number="21">and his hearers were all amazed, and began to ask one another, “Is not this the man who in Jerusalem tried to exterminate those who called upon that Name, and came here on purpose to carry them off in chains to the High Priests?”</verse>
  <verse number="22">Saul, however, gained more and more influence, and as for the Jews living in Damascus, he bewildered them with his proofs that Jesus is the Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="23">At length the Jews plotted to kill Saul;</verse>
  <verse number="24">but information of their intention was given to him. They even watched the gates, day and night, in order to murder him;</verse>
  <verse number="25">but his disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a hamper.</verse>
  <verse number="26">So he came to Jerusalem and made several attempts to associate with the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, being in doubt as to whether he himself was a disciple.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Barnabas, however, came to his assistance. He brought Saul to the Apostles, and related to them how, on his journey, he had seen the Lord, and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had fearlessly taught in the name of Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Henceforth Saul was one of them, going in and out of the city,</verse>
  <verse number="29">and speaking fearlessly in the name of the Lord. And he often talked with the Hellenists and had discussions with them.</verse>
  <verse number="30">But they kept trying to take his life. On learning this, the brethren brought him down to Caesarea, and then sent him by sea to Tarsus.</verse>
  <verse number="31">The Church, however, throughout the whole of Judaea, Galilee and Samaria, had peace and was spiritually built up; and grew in numbers, living in the fear of the Lord and receiving encouragement from the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Now Peter, as he went to town after town, came down also to God’s people at Lud.</verse>
  <verse number="33">There he found a man of the name of Aeneas, who for eight years had kept his bed, through being paralysed.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ cures you. Rise and make your own bed.” He at once rose to his feet.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And all the people of Lud and Sharon saw him; and they turned to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Among the disciples at Jaffa was a woman called Tabitha, or, as the name may be translated, ‘Dorcas.’ Her life was wholly devoted to the good and charitable actions which she was constantly doing.</verse>
  <verse number="37">But, as it happened, just at that time she was taken ill and died. After washing her body they laid it out in a room upstairs.</verse>
  <verse number="38">Lud, however, being near Jaffa, the disciples, who had heard that Peter was at Lud, sent two men to him with an urgent request that he would come across to them without delay.</verse>
  <verse number="39">So Peter rose and went with them. On his arrival they took him upstairs, and the widow women all came and stood by his side, weeping and showing him the underclothing and cloaks and garments of all kinds which Dorcas used to make while she was still with them.</verse>
  <verse number="40">Peter, however, putting every one out of the room, knelt down and prayed, and then turning to the body, he said, “Tabitha, rise.” Dorcas at once opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, sat up.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Then, giving her his hand, he raised her to her feet and, calling to him God’s people and the widows, he gave her back to them alive.</verse>
  <verse number="42">This incident became known throughout Jaffa, and many believed in the Lord;</verse>
  <verse number="43">and Peter remained for a considerable time at Jaffa, staying at the house of a man called Simon, a tanner.</verse>
