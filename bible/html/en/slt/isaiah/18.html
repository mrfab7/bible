<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="18" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wo to the land of the whizzing of wings, which is from beyond the rivers of Cush:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Sending messengers upon the sea, and in vessels of the bulrush upon the face of the waters, Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation drawn out and sharpened, to a people to be feared from this, and farther off; a nation of might, of might, and of treading down, of which the rivers divided up its land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">All ye inhabiting the habitable globe, and dwelling in the earth, when lifting up a signal on the mountains, ye shall see; and when striking the trumpet, ye shall hear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For thus said Jehovah to me, I will cause rest, and I will behold in my dwelling place as the serene heat upon the light, and as a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For before the harvest, when the flower was completed, and the sour grape shall be ripening in the flower, and he cut off the shoots with pruning-hooks, and cutting off he took away the tendrils.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">They shall be left together to the ravenous bird of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: and the ravenous bird summered upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In that time shall a gift be brought to Jehovah of armies of a people drawn out, and sharpened, and from a people to be feared from this, and farther off; a nation of might, of might, and of treading down, of which the rivers divided up its lands, to the place of the name of Jehovah of armies, mount Zion.</p>
