  <verse number="1">After this, it came to pass, that two eunuchs, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, offended their lord.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Pharao being angry with them (now the one was chief butler, the other chief baker)</verse>
  <verse number="3">He sent them to the prison of the commander of the soldiers, in which Joseph also was prisoner,</verse>
  <verse number="4">But the keeper of the prison delivered them to Joseph, and he served them. Some little time passed, and they were kept in custody.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And they both dreamed a dream the same night, according to the interpretation agreeing to themselves:</verse>
  <verse number="6">And when Joseph was come in to them in the morning, and saw them sad,</verse>
  <verse number="7">He asked them, saying: Why is your oountenance sadder to day than usual?</verse>
  <verse number="8">They answered: We have dreamed a dream, and there is nobody to interpret it to us. And Joseph said to them: Both not interpretation belong to God? Tell me what you have dreamed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The chief butler first told his dream: I saw before me a vine,</verse>
  <verse number="10">On which were three branches, which by little and little sent out buds, and after the blossoms brought forth ripe grapes :</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the cup of Pharao was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into the cup which I held, and I gave the cup to Pharao.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three branches are yet three days:</verse>
  <verse number="13">After which Pharao will remember thy service, and will restore thee to thy former place: and thou shah present him the cup according to thy office, as before thou wast wont to do.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Only remember me, when it shall be well with thee, and do me this kindness: to put Pharao in mind to take me out of this prison:</verse>
  <verse number="15">For I was stolen away out of the land I of the Hebrews, and here without any fault was cast into the dungeon.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The chief baker seeing that he had wisely interpreted the dream, said: I also dreamed a dream, That I bed three baskets of meal upon my heed:</verse>
  <verse number="17">And that in one basket which was uppermost, I carried all meats that are made by the art of baking, and that the birds ate out of it.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three baskets are yet three days:</verse>
  <verse number="19">After which Pharao will take thy hand from thee, and hang thee on a cross, and the birds shall tear thy flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The third day after this was the birthday of Pharao: and he made a. great feast for his servants, and at the banquet remembered the chief butler, and the chief baker.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he restored the one to his place to present him the cup:</verse>
  <verse number="22">The other he hanged on a gibbet, that the truth of the interpreter might be shewn.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But the chief butler, when things prospered with him, forgot his interpreter.</verse>
