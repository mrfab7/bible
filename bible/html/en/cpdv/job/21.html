<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="21" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job responded by saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I beseech you to hear my words and to do penance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Permit me, and I will speak, and afterwards, if you see fit, you can laugh at my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Is my dispute against man, so that I would have no reason to be discouraged?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Listen to me and be astonished, and place a finger over your mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">As for me, when I think it over, I am afraid, and trembling convulses my body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Why then do the impious live, having been lifted up and strengthened with riches?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They see their offspring continue before them: a commotion of close relatives and of children’s children in their sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Their houses have been secure and peaceable, and there is no staff of God over them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Their cattle have conceived and have not miscarried; their cow has given birth and is not deprived of her newborn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Their little ones go out like a flock, and their children jump around playfully.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They take up the timbrel and the lyre, and they rejoice at the sound of the organ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Their days are prolonged in wealth, yet, in an instant, they descend into hell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Who has said to God, “Depart from us, for we do not want the knowledge of your ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Who is the Almighty that we should serve him? And how is it helpful to us if we pray to him?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">It is true that their good things are not in their power. May the counsel of the impious be far from me!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">How often will the lamp of the wicked be extinguished, and a deluge overtake them, and how often will he distribute the afflictions of his wrath?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">They will be like chaff before the face of the wind, and like ashes that the whirlwind scatters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">God will preserve the grief of the father for his sons, and, when he repays, then he will understand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">His eyes will see his own destruction, and he will drink from the wrath of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For what does he care what happens to his house after him, or if the number of its months are reduced by half?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Can anyone teach holy knowledge to God, who judges the exalted?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">This one dies strong and healthy, rich and happy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">His gut is full of fat and his bones are moistened with marrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">In truth, another dies in bitterness of soul, without any resources.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And yet they will sleep together in the dust, and worms will cover them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Surely, I know your thoughts and your sinful judgments against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For you say, “Where is the house of the ruler, and where are the tabernacles of the impious?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Ask any passerby whom you wish, and you will realize that he understands these same things:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">that the evil-doer is reserved for the day of destruction, and he will be led to the day of wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Who will reprove his way to his face, and who will repay him for what he has done?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He will be led to the tomb, and he will remain awake in the chaos of the dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">He has been found acceptable to the banks of the River of Lamentation, and he will draw any man towards him, and there are countless before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Therefore, how long will you console me in vain, when your answer is shown to be repugnant to truth?</p>
