<p class="verse" data-verse="1">In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will [God] appoint [for] walls and bulwarks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thou wilt keep [him] in perfect peace, [whose] mind [is] stayed [on thee]: because he trusteth in thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH [is] everlasting strength:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, [even] to the ground; he bringeth it [even] to the dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The foot shall tread it down, [even] the feet of the poor, [and] the steps of the needy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The way of the just [is] uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; the desire of [our] soul [is] to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments [are] in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Let favour be shewed to the wicked, [yet] will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">LORD, [when] thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: [but] they shall see, and be ashamed for [their] envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">O LORD our God, [other] lords beside thee have had dominion over us: [but] by thee only will we make mention of thy name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">[They are] dead, they shall not live; [they are] deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed [it] far [unto] all the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer [when] thy chastening [was] upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Like as a woman with child, [that] draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, [and] crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thy dead [men] shall live, [together with] my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew [is as] the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.</p>
