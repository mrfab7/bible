<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Saul was assenting to his murder. And in that day was a great expulsion upon the church in Jerusalem; and all were scattered up and down in the countries of Judea and Samaria, except the sent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And circumspect men interred Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Saul abused the church, going into houses, and drawing out men and women, delivered to prison.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Truly therefore the dispersed passed through announcing good news the word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Philip having come down to the city of Samaria, proclaimed Christ to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the crowds unanimously attended to things spoken by Philip, in their hearing and seeing the signs which he did.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For of many having unclean spirits, crying with a great voice, they came out: and many affected with palsy, and the lame, were healed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And great joy was in that city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And a certain man, Simon by name, was before in the city using magic, and astonishing the nation of Samaria, saying himself to be somebody great:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">To whom attended from little to great, saying, This is the great power of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And they attended to him, because for a sufficient time they were astonished by magics.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And when they believed Philip announcing the good news of the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were immersed, both men and women.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Simon also himself believed: and having been immersed, he was persevering with Philip, beholding the signs and great powers having been, they were astonished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And the sent in Jerusalem having heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent them Peter and John:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Who, having gone down, prayed for them, that they receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">(For not yet was it fallen upon any of them: only they were immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Then put they hands upon them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Simon having seen that by putting on of hands of the sent the Holy Spirit is given, he brought money to them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Saying, Give me also this power, that upon whomsoever I put hands, he might receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Peter said to him, May thy silver be for ruin with thee, for thou thoughtest the gift of God to be purchased for money.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">No portion is to thee, nor lot, in this word: for thy heart is not upright before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray to God, if perhaps the thought of thy heart be remitted to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For I see thee being in the bile of bitterness, and bond of iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Simon having answered, said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that nothing which ye have spoken come upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Truly therefore, they having testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and announced good news to many towns of the Samaritans.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And a messenger of the Lord spake to Philip, saying, Arise, and go at noon in the way going down from Jerusalem to Gaza, (this is desert.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And having risen, he went: and, behold, an Ethiopian man, an eunuch of great power of Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come going to worship in Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And he was returning, and sitting in his chariot he read the prophet Esaias.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And the Spirit said to Philip, Come near, and be joined to this chariot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And Philip running near, heard him reading the prophet Esaias, and he said, Truly knowest thou what thou readest?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And he said, How can I, except somebody guide me? And he called upon Philip coming up to sit with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And the passage of the writing which he read was this, As a sheep for slaughter was he brought; and as a lamb before him shearing it dumb, so he opened not his mouth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">In his humiliation was his judgment taken away: and his generation who shall recount? for his life is taken from the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And the eunuch having answered Philip, said, I pray thee, of whom speaks the prophet this of himself or of some other?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And Philip having opened his mouth, and begun from this writing, announced to him the good news, Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And as they went in the way, they came to some water: and the eunuch said, Behold water; what hinders me to be immersed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And Philip said, If thou believest from the whole heart, it is lawful. And having answered, he said, I believe the Son of God to be Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And he ordered the chariot to stand: and both went down into the Water, both Philip and the eunuch: and he immersed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no more: for he went his way rejoicing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he announced the good news to all of the cities, even till he came to Cesarea.</p>
