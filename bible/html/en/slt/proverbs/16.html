<p class="verse" data-verse="1">To man the dispositions of the heart, and the answer of the tongue from Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">All the ways of man are clean in his eyes, and Jehovah tried the spirits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Roll to Jehovah thy works, and thy purposes shall be established.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Jehovah made all to his purpose, and also the unjust for the day of evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Every one lifted up of heart an abomination to Jehovah: and hand to hand, shall not be unpunished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">By mercy and truth iniquity shall be expiated: and in the fear of Jehovah a departing from evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The ways of a man being accepted of Jehovah also he will make his enemies friends with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Good a little with justice above abundance of increase with no judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The heart of man will purpose his ways, and Jehovah will prepare his steps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Divining upon the lips of the king: his mouth will not transgress in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Weighing and balances of judgment are to Jehovah, and his work all the stones of the bag.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">An abomination of kings to do injustice: for in justice shall the throne be prepared.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Lips of justice the acceptance of kings; and he will love the word of the upright.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The king’s wrath, messengers of death: and a wise man shall expiate it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">In the light of the king’s face is life, and his acceptance as the cloud of the latter rain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The obtaining of wisdom how good above gold and the obtaining of understanding to be chosen above silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: to watch his ways the guarding of his soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Pride before a breaking, and a spirit lifted up before a fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Good the cast down of spirit with the humble more than to divide the spoil with the proud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He understanding in the word shall find good: and he trusting in Jehovah, he being happy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He understanding shall call to the wise of heart: and sweetness of lips shall add knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The understanding of him possessing it is a fountain of life: and the instruction of the foolish is folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The heart of the wise shall attend to his mouth, and he shall add knowledge to his lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Words of pleasantness an, honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and healing to the bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">There is a way straight before a man, and its latter state the ways of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The soul of him laboring, labored for himself; for his mouth urged upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">A man of Belial dug up evil, and upon his lips, as a burning fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A man of perverseness shall send forth strife: and a tale-bearer separates friends.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">A man of violence will seduce his neighbor, and he caused him to go in a way not good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Closing his eyes to purpose perverseness: biting his lips he completed evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Old age a crown of glorying, shall be found in the way of justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He slow to anger is, good above the strong; and, he ruling over his spirit above him taking a city,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">In the bosom he shall, cast the lot; and from Jehovah all his judgment.</p>
