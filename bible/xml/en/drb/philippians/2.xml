  <verse number="1">If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of charity, if any society of the spirit, if any bowels of commiseration:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Fulfil ye my joy, that you may be of one mind, having the same charity, being of one accord, agreeing in sentiment.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Let nothing be done through contention, neither by vain glory: but in humility, let each esteem others better than themselves:</verse>
  <verse number="4">Each one not considering the things that are his own, but those that are other men’s.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</verse>
  <verse number="6">Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</verse>
  <verse number="7">But emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and in habit found as a man.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For which cause God also hath exalted him, and hath given him a name which is above all names:</verse>
  <verse number="10">That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth:</verse>
  <verse number="11">And that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Wherefore, my dearly beloved, (as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but much more now in my absence,) with fear and trembling work out your salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For it is God who worketh in you, both to will and to accomplish, according to his good will.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And do ye all things without murmurings and hesitations;</verse>
  <verse number="15">That you may be blameless, and sincere children of God, without reproof, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation; among whom you shine as lights in the world.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Holding forth the word of life to my glory in the day of Christ, because I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Yea, and if I be made a victim upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and congratulate with you all.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And for the selfsame thing do you also rejoice, and congratulate with me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy unto you shortly, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know the things concerning you.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For I have no man so of the same mind, who with sincere affection is solicitous for you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For all seek the things that are their own; not the things that are Jesus Christ’s.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Now know ye the proof of him, that as a son with the father, so hath he served with me in the gospel.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Him therefore I hope to send unto you immediately, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And I trust in the Lord, that I myself also shall come to you shortly.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow labourer, and fellow soldier, but your apostle, and he that hath ministered to my wants.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For indeed he longed after you all: and was sad, for that you had heard that he was sick.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For indeed he was sick, nigh unto death; but God had mercy on him; and not only on him, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Therefore I sent him the more speedily: that seeing him again, you may rejoice, and I may be without sorrow.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Receive him therefore with all joy in the Lord; and treat with honour such as he is.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Because for the work of Christ he came to the point of death: delivering his life, that he might fulfil that which on your part was wanting towards my service.</verse>
