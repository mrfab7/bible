<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Better [is] the poor that walketh in his integrity, than [he that is] perverse in his lips, and is a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Also, [that] the soul [be] without knowledge, [it is] not good; and he that hasteth with [his] feet sinneth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A false witness shall not be unpunished, and [he that] speaketh lies shall not escape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man [is] a friend to him that giveth gifts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth [them with] words, [yet] they [are] wanting [to him].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A false witness shall not be unpunished, and [he that] speaketh lies shall perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and [it is] his glory to pass over a transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The king’s wrath [is] as the roaring of a lion; but his favour [is] as dew upon the grass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A foolish son [is] the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife [are] a continual dropping.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">House and riches [are] the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife [is] from the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; [but] he that despiseth his ways shall die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver [him], yet thou must do it again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">[There are] many devices in a man’s heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The desire of a man [is] his kindness: and a poor man [is] better than a liar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The fear of the LORD [tendeth] to life: and [he that hath it] shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">A slothful [man] hideth his hand in [his] bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, [and] he will understand knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He that wasteth [his] father, [and] chaseth away [his] mother, [is] a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Cease, my son, to hear the instruction [that causeth] to err from the words of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.</p>
