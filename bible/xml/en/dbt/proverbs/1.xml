<chapter book="Proverbs" number="1" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:</verse>
  <verse number="2">to know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;</verse>
  <verse number="3">to receive the instruction of wisdom, righteousness and judgment, and equity;</verse>
  <verse number="4">to give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He that is wise will hear, and will increase learning; and the intelligent will gain wise counsels:</verse>
  <verse number="6">to understand a proverb and an allegory, the words of the wise and their enigmas.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge: fools despise wisdom and instruction.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother;</verse>
  <verse number="9">for they shall be a garland of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</verse>
  <verse number="10">My son, if sinners entice thee, consent not.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;</verse>
  <verse number="12">let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, and whole, as those that go down into the pit;</verse>
  <verse number="13">we shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</verse>
  <verse number="14">cast in thy lot among us; we will all have one purse:</verse>
  <verse number="15">—my son, walk not in the way with them, keep back thy foot from their path;</verse>
  <verse number="16">for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For in vain the net is spread in the sight of anything which hath wings.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And these lay wait for their own blood; they lurk secretly for their own lives.</verse>
  <verse number="19">So are the paths of every one that is greedy of gain: it taketh away the life of its possessors.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Wisdom crieth without; she raiseth her voice in the broadways;</verse>
  <verse number="21">she calleth in the chief [place] of concourse, in the entry of the gates; in the city she uttereth her words:</verse>
  <verse number="22">How long, simple ones, will ye love simpleness, and scorners take pleasure in their scorning, and the foolish hate knowledge?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour forth my spirit unto you, I will make known to you my words.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one regarded;</verse>
  <verse number="25">and ye have rejected all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</verse>
  <verse number="26">I also will laugh in your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh;</verse>
  <verse number="27">when your fear cometh as sudden destruction, and your calamity cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come upon you:</verse>
  <verse number="28">—then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me early, and shall not find me.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Because they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of Jehovah;</verse>
  <verse number="30">they would none of my counsel, they despised all my reproof:</verse>
  <verse number="31">therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their way, and be filled with their own devices.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of the foolish shall cause them to perish.</verse>
  <verse number="33">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be at rest from fear of evil.</verse>
