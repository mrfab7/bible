  <verse number="1">Since many have undertaken to arrange the narration concerning things rendered perfectly certain among us,</verse>
  <verse number="2">As they delivered to us, who from the beginning being eyewitnesses, and servants of the word;</verse>
  <verse number="3">It seemed fitting to me also, having comprehended all things thoroughly from above, to write to thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
  <verse number="4">That thou mightest know the certainty of the words concerning which thou hast been instructed.</verse>
  <verse number="5">There was in the days of Herod, king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the daily order of Abia: and his wife the daughter of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And they were both just before God, going faultless in all the commands and precepts of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And no child was to them, as Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in their days.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it was in his being priest, in the arranging of the daily order before God,</verse>
  <verse number="9">According to the custom of the priesthood, he drew lots to burn incense, having entered into the temple of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And all the multitude of people were praying without at the hour of incense.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And a messenger of the Lord was seen to him, standing from the right of the altar of fumigation.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Zacharias having seen, was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the messenger said to him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy supplication has been heard; and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And joy shall be to thee, and gladness: and many shall rejoice at his birth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For he shall be great before the Lord, and wine and fermented liquor he should not drink; and with the Holy Spirit shall he be filled, even from his mother’s womb.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And many of the sons of Israel shall he turn back to the Lord their God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he shall come before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn back the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the intelligence of the just; to prepare a people having been put in order for the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Zacharias said to the messenger, By what shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife advanced in her days.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The messenger having answered, said to him, I am Gabriel, standing before God; and was sent to speak to thee, and announce these good news to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And, behold, thou shalt be silent, and not able to speak, till the day in which these things shall be, because thou didst not believe my words, which shall be completed in their time.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the people were expecting Zacharias, and wondered at his tarrying in the temple.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And having come out, he could not speak to them: and they knew that he had seen a vision in the temple: and he was nodding to them, and remained dumb.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And it was when the days of his service were filled, he departed to his house.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And after these days Elizabeth his wife conceived, and concealed herself five months, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="25">That so has the Lord done to me in days which he looked upon, to take away my reproach among men.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And in the sixth month the messenger Gabriel was sent by God into a city of Galilee, to which the name Nazareth,</verse>
  <verse number="27">To a virgin betrothed to a man to whom the name of Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name Mary.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the messenger, having come in to her said, Hail, thou made acceptable; the Lord with thee: praised thou among women.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And having seen him, she was troubled at his words, and turned in her thoughts of what country this greeting might be.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And the messenger said to her, Fear not, Mary: thou hast found grace with God.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And, behold, thou shalt conceive in the womb, and shalt bear a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS.</verse>
  <verse number="32">He shall be great, and he shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give him the throne of David his father:</verse>
  <verse number="33">And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Mary said to the messenger, How shall this be, since I know not man?</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the messenger having answered, said to her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: wherefore also the holy thing born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And, behold, Elizabeth thy kinsman, she also having conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month to her, called barren.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For nothing shall be impossible with God.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And Mary said Behold the servant of the Lord; may it be to me according to thy word. And the messenger departed from her.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And Mary having risen in those days, went into the mountainous country with haste, into a city of Judah;</verse>
  <verse number="40">And she entered into the house of Zacharias, and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And it was when Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit:</verse>
  <verse number="42">And she called out with a great voice, and said, Praised thou among women, and praised the fruit of thy womb.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And whence this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
  <verse number="44">For, behold, when the voice of thy greeting was in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And happy she having believed: for a completion of the things spoken shall be to her from the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And my Spirit rejoiced in God my Saviour.</verse>
  <verse number="48">For he looked upon the humiliation of his servant; for, behold, from now shall all generations deem me happy.</verse>
  <verse number="49">For the powerful one has done great things for me; and his name holy.</verse>
  <verse number="50">And his mercy to generations of generations to those fearing him.</verse>
  <verse number="51">He has done strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thought of their heart.</verse>
  <verse number="52">He has pulled down the powerful from thrones, and lifted up the.</verse>
  <verse number="53">He has filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he sent away empty.</verse>
  <verse number="54">He succored Israel his servant, remembering mercy;</verse>
  <verse number="55">As he spake to our fathers, to Abram, and his seed forever.</verse>
  <verse number="56">And Mary remained with her about three months, and returned to her house.</verse>
  <verse number="57">And the time was completed to Elizabeth, for her to bring forth; and she brought forth a son.</verse>
  <verse number="58">And they dwelling near and her kinsmen heard, for the Lord magnified his mercy with her; and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
  <verse number="59">And it was in the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him by the name of his father Zacharias.</verse>
  <verse number="60">And his mother, having answered said, Nay; but he shall be called John.</verse>
  <verse number="61">And they said to her, That there is none among thy kindred who is called by this name.</verse>
  <verse number="62">And they nodded to his father, what he may wish to have him called.</verse>
  <verse number="63">And having asked for a small writing tablet, he wrote, saying, John is his name. And they all wondered.</verse>
  <verse number="64">And his month was opened immediately, and his tongue, and he spake, praising God.</verse>
  <verse number="65">And fear was upon all dwelling round about them: and in all the mount of Judea all these words were discoursed about.</verse>
  <verse number="66">And all having heard, set in their heart, saying, What then shall this child be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
  <verse number="67">And Zacharias his father, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="68">Praised the Lord God of Israel; for he reviewed and he has made a redemption for his people,</verse>
  <verse number="69">And he raised up a horn of salvation to us in the house of David, his servant;</verse>
  <verse number="70">As he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets, from forever:</verse>
  <verse number="71">Salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all hating us;</verse>
  <verse number="72">To do mercy with our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant:</verse>
  <verse number="73">The oath which he sware to Abraham our father,</verse>
  <verse number="74">To give to us, fearlessly, delivered from the hands of our enemies,</verse>
  <verse number="75">To serve him in sanctity and justice before him all the days of our life.</verse>
  <verse number="76">And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;</verse>
  <verse number="77">To give knowledge of salvation to his people, in remission of their sins.</verse>
  <verse number="78">Through the bowels of mercy of our God; by which the rising of the sun of sublimity has reviewed us,</verse>
  <verse number="79">To shine forth to those in darkness and sitting in the shadow of death, to direct our feet in the way of peace.</verse>
  <verse number="80">And the child grew, and was strengthened in spirit, and he was in the deserts till the day of his shewing forth to Israel.</verse>
