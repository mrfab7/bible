  <verse number="1">Then Job answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">How long will ye vex my soul, And break me in pieces with words?</verse>
  <verse number="3">These ten times have ye reproached me: Ye are not ashamed that ye deal hardly with me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And be it indeed that I have erred, Mine error remaineth with myself.</verse>
  <verse number="5">If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, And plead against me my reproach;</verse>
  <verse number="6">Know now that God hath subverted me in my cause, And hath compassed me with his net.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry for help, but there is no justice.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He hath walled up my way that I cannot pass, And hath set darkness in my paths.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He hath stripped me of my glory, And taken the crown from my head.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He hath broken me down on every side, and I am gone; And my hope hath he plucked up like a tree.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He hath also kindled his wrath against me, And he counteth me unto him as one of his adversaries.</verse>
  <verse number="12">His troops come on together, And cast up their way against me, And encamp round about my tent.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He hath put my brethren far from me, And mine acquaintance are wholly estranged from me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">My kinsfolk have failed, And my familiar friends have forgotten me.</verse>
  <verse number="15">They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger; I am an alien in their sight.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I call unto my servant, and he giveth me no answer, Though I entreat him with my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">My breath is strange to my wife, And my supplication to the children of mine own mother.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Even young children despise me; If I arise, they speak against me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">All my familiar friends abhor me, And they whom I loved are turned against me.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, And I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; For the hand of God hath touched me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Why do ye persecute me as God, And are not satisfied with my flesh?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book!</verse>
  <verse number="24">That with an iron pen and lead They were graven in the rock for ever!</verse>
  <verse number="25">But as for me I know that my Redeemer liveth, And at last he will stand up upon the earth:</verse>
  <verse number="26">And after my skin, even this body, is destroyed, Then without my flesh shall I see God;</verse>
  <verse number="27">Whom I, even I, shall see, on my side, And mine eyes shall behold, and not as a stranger. My heart is consumed within me.</verse>
  <verse number="28">If ye say, How we will persecute him! And that the root of the matter is found in me;</verse>
  <verse number="29">Be ye afraid of the sword: For wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, That ye may know there is a judgment.</verse>
