<chapter book="Hebrews" number="5" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Every high priest is appointed from among men to represent them in matters relating to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and misguided, since he himself is subject to weakness.</verse>
  <verse number="3">That is why he is obligated to offer sacrifices for his own sins, as well as for the sins of the people.</verse>
  <verse number="4">No one takes this honor upon himself; he must be called by God, just as Aaron was.</verse>
  <verse number="5">So also Christ did not take upon Himself the glory of becoming a high priest, but He was called by the One who said to Him: “You are My Son; today I have become Your Father.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">And in another passage God says: “You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.”</verse>
  <verse number="7">During the days of Jesus’ earthly life, He offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the One who could save Him from death, and He was heard because of His reverence.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Although He was a Son, He learned obedience from what He suffered.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And having been made perfect, He became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey Him</verse>
  <verse number="10">and was designated by God as high priest in the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
  <verse number="11">We have much to say about this, but it is hard to explain, because you are dull of hearing.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Although by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to reteach you the basic principles of God’s word. You need milk, not solid food!</verse>
  <verse number="13">For everyone who lives on milk is still an infant, inexperienced in the message of righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained their senses to distinguish good from evil.</verse>
