<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="16" data-translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" data-translation-id="jps" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Send ye the lambs for the ruler of the land From the crags that are toward the wilderness, Unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For it shall be that, as wandering birds, As a scattered nest, So shall the daughters of Moab be At the fords of Arnon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Give counsel, execute justice; Make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; Hide the outcasts; betray not the fugitive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Let mine outcasts dwell with thee; As for Moab, be thou a covert to him from the face of the spoiler.’ For the extortion is at an end, spoiling ceaseth, They that trampled down are consumed out of the land;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And a throne is established through mercy, And there sitteth thereon in truth, in the tent of David, One that judgeth, and seeketh justice, and is ready in righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">We have heard of the pride of Moab; He is very proud; Even of his haughtiness, and his pride, and his arrogancy, His ill-founded boastings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Therefore shall Moab wail for Moab, Every one shall wail; for the sweet cakes of Kir-hareseth shall ye mourn, Sorely stricken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For the fields of Heshbon languish, And the vine of Sibmah, Whose choice plants did overcome The lords of nations; They reached even unto Jazer, They wandered into the wilderness; Her branches were spread abroad, They passed over the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Therefore I will weep with the weeping of Jazer For the vine of Sibmah; I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and Elealeh; For upon thy summer fruits and upon thy harvest The battle shout is fallen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And gladness and joy are taken away Out of the fruitful field; And in the vineyards there shall be no singing, Neither shall there be shouting; No treader shall tread out wine in the presses; I have made the vintage shout to cease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Wherefore my heart moaneth like a harp for Moab, And mine inward parts for Kir-heres.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab hath wearied himself upon the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray; but he shall not prevail</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">This is the word that the LORD spoke concerning Moab in time past.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But now the LORD hath spoken, saying: ‘Within three years, as the years of a hireling, and the glory of Moab shall wax contemptible for all his great multitude; and the remnant shall be very small and without strength.’</p>
