<chapter book="Daniel" number="10" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.</verse>
  <verse number="2">In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:</verse>
  <verse number="6">His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in color to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell on them, so that they fled to hide themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he said to me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright: for to you am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Then said he to me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that you did set your heart to understand, and to chasten yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I am come for your words.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, see, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Now I am come to make you understand what shall befall your people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And when he had spoken such words to me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said to him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned on me, and I have retained no strength.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,</verse>
  <verse number="19">And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be to you, be strong, yes, be strong. And when he had spoken to me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for you have strengthened me.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Then said he, Know you why I come to you? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, see, the prince of Grecia shall come.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But I will show you that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holds with me in these things, but Michael your prince.</verse>
