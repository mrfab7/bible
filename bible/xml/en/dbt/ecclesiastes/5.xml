<chapter book="Ecclesiastes" number="5" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and draw near to hear, rather than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they know not that they do evil.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter anything before God: for God is in the heavens, and thou upon earth; therefore let thy words be few.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For a dream cometh through the multitude of business, and a fool’s voice through a multitude of words.</verse>
  <verse number="4">When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an inadvertence. Wherefore should God be wroth at thy voice, and destroy the work of thy hands?</verse>
  <verse number="7">For in the multitude of dreams are vanities; so with many words: but fear God.</verse>
  <verse number="8">If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter; for a higher than the high is watching, and there are higher than they.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Moreover the earth is every way profitable: the king [himself] is dependent upon the field.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver, nor he that loveth abundance with increase. This also is vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="11">When goods increase, they are increased that eat them; and what profit is there to the owner thereof, except the beholding [of them] with his eyes?</verse>
  <verse number="12">The sleep of the labourer is sweet, whether he have eaten little or much; but the fulness of the rich doth not suffer him to sleep.</verse>
  <verse number="13">There is a grievous evil that I have seen under the sun: riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt;</verse>
  <verse number="14">or those riches perish by some evil circumstance, and if he have begotten a son, there is nothing in his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="15">As he came forth from his mother’s womb, naked shall he go away again as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And this also is a grievous evil, that in all points as he came so doth he go away, and what profit hath he, in having laboured for the wind?</verse>
  <verse number="17">All his days also he eateth in darkness, and hath much vexation, and sickness, and irritation.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Behold what I have seen good and comely: [it is] to eat and to drink, and to enjoy good in all his labour wherewith [man] laboureth under the sun, all the days of his life which God hath given him: for that is his portion.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and power to eat thereof, and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labour: that is a gift of God.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For he will not much remember the days of his life, because God answereth [him] with the joy of his heart.</verse>
