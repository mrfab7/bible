  <verse number="1">Then Job answered:</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Even today my complaint is bitter. His hand is heavy despite my groaning.</verse>
  <verse number="3">If only I knew where to find Him, so that I could go to His seat.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I would plead my case before Him and fill my mouth with arguments.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I would learn how He would answer, and consider what He would say.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Would He contend with me in His great power? No, He would certainly take note of me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then an upright man could reason with Him, and I would be delivered forever from my Judge.</verse>
  <verse number="8">If I go east, He is not there, and if I go west, I cannot find Him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">When He is at work in the north, I cannot behold Him; when He turns to the south, I cannot see Him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Yet He knows the way I have taken; when He has tested me, I will come forth as gold.</verse>
  <verse number="11">My feet have followed in His tracks; I have kept His way without turning aside.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I have not departed from the command of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my daily bread.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But He is unchangeable, and who can oppose Him? He does what He desires.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For He carries out His decree against me, and He has many such plans.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Therefore I am terrified in His presence; when I consider this, I fear Him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Yet I am not silenced by the darkness, by the thick darkness that covers my face.</verse>
