  <verse number="1">Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold which they refine;</verse>
  <verse number="2">Iron is taken out of the dust, and copper is molten out of the stone.</verse>
  <verse number="3">[Man] putteth an end to the darkness, and exploreth to the utmost limit, the stones of darkness and of the shadow of death.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He openeth a shaft far from the inhabitants [of the earth]: forgotten of the foot, they hang suspended; away below men they hover.</verse>
  <verse number="5">As for the earth, out of it cometh bread, and underneath it is turned up as by fire;</verse>
  <verse number="6">The stones of it are the place of sapphires, and it hath dust of gold.</verse>
  <verse number="7">It is a path no bird of prey knoweth, and the vulture’s eye hath not seen it;</verse>
  <verse number="8">The proud beasts have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed over it.</verse>
  <verse number="9">[Man] putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock, he overturneth the mountains by the root.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He cutteth out channels in the rocks, and his eye seeth every precious thing.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He bindeth the streams that they drip not, and what is hidden he bringeth forth to light.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But wisdom, where shall it be found? and where is the place of understanding?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Man knoweth not the value thereof; and it is not found in the land of the living.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The deep saith, It is not in me; and the sea saith, It is not with me.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Choice gold cannot be given for it, nor silver be weighed for its price.</verse>
  <verse number="16">It is not set in the balance with gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, and the sapphire.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Gold and glass cannot be compared to it, nor vessels of fine gold be its exchange.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Corals and crystal are no more remembered; yea, the acquisition of wisdom is above rubies.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The topaz of Ethiopia shall not be compared to it, neither shall it be set in the balance with pure gold.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?</verse>
  <verse number="21">For it is hidden from the eyes of all living, and concealed from the fowl of the heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Destruction and death say, We have heard its report with our ears.</verse>
  <verse number="23">God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth its place:</verse>
  <verse number="24">For he looketh to the ends of the earth, he seeth under the whole heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="25">In making a weight for the wind, and meting out the waters by measure,</verse>
  <verse number="26">In appointing a statute for the rain, and a way for the thunder’s flash:</verse>
  <verse number="27">Then did he see it, and declare it; he established it, yea, and searched it out;</verse>
  <verse number="28">And unto man he said, Lo, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.</verse>
