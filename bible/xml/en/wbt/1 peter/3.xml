<chapter book="1 Peter" number="3" translation="Webster Bible Translation" translationID="wbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the deportment of the wives;</verse>
  <verse number="2">While they behold your chaste manner of life coupled with fear.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing gold, or of putting on apparel;</verse>
  <verse number="4">But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For after this manner in former times the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands:</verse>
  <verse number="6">Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honor to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers be not hindered.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another; love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but on the contrary, blessing; knowing that ye are called to this, that ye should inherit a blessing.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For he that will love life, and see good days, let him restrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:</verse>
  <verse number="11">Let him shun evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and pursue it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And who is he that will harm you, if ye are followers of that which is good?</verse>
  <verse number="14">But if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;</verse>
  <verse number="15">But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evil-doers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good deportment in Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For it is better, if the will of God is so, that ye suffer for well-doing, than for evil-doing.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive by the Spirit:</verse>
  <verse number="19">By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;</verse>
  <verse number="20">Who formerly were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was preparing, in which few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The like figure to which, even baptism, doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="22">Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels, and authorities, and powers being made subject to him.</verse>
