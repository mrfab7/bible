  <verse number="1">My son! my law forget not, And my commands let thy heart keep,</verse>
  <verse number="2">For length of days and years, Life and peace they do add to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Let not kindness and truth forsake thee, Bind them on thy neck, Write them on the tablet of thy heart,</verse>
  <verse number="4">And find grace and good understanding In the eyes of God and man.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Trust unto Jehovah with all thy heart, And unto thine own understanding lean not.</verse>
  <verse number="6">In all thy ways know thou Him, And He doth make straight thy paths.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Be not wise in thine own eyes, Fear Jehovah, and turn aside from evil.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Healing it is to thy navel, And moistening to thy bones.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Honour Jehovah from thy substance, And from the beginning of all thine increase;</verse>
  <verse number="10">And filled are thy barns with plenty, And with new wine thy presses break forth.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Chastisement of Jehovah, my son, despise not, And be not vexed with His reproof,</verse>
  <verse number="12">For whom Jehovah loveth He reproveth, Even as a father the son He is pleased with.</verse>
  <verse number="13">O the happiness of a man who hath found wisdom, And of a man who bringeth forth understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For better is her merchandise Than the merchandise of silver, And than gold—her increase.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Precious she is above rubies, And all thy pleasures are not comparable to her.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Length of days is in her right hand, In her left are wealth and honour.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace.</verse>
  <verse number="18">A tree of life she is to those laying hold on her, And whoso is retaining her is happy.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Jehovah by wisdom did found the earth, He prepared the heavens by understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="20">By His knowledge depths have been rent, And clouds do drop dew.</verse>
  <verse number="21">My son! let them not turn from thine eyes, Keep thou wisdom and thoughtfulness,</verse>
  <verse number="22">And they are life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Then thou goest thy way confidently, And thy foot doth not stumble.</verse>
  <verse number="24">If thou liest down, thou art not afraid, Yea, thou hast lain down, And sweet hath been thy sleep.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Be not afraid of sudden fear, And of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For Jehovah is at thy side, And He hath kept thy foot from capture.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Withhold not good from its owners, When thy hand is toward God to do it.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Say not thou to thy friend, ‘Go, and return, and to-morrow I give,’ And substance with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Devise not against thy neighbour evil, And he sitting confidently with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Strive not with a man without cause, If he have not done thee evil.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Be not envious of a man of violence, Nor fix thou on any of his ways.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For an abomination to Jehovah is the perverted, And with the upright is His secret counsel.</verse>
  <verse number="33">The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked. And the habitation of the righteous He blesseth.</verse>
  <verse number="34">If the scorners He doth scorn, Yet to the humble He doth give grace.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Honour do the wise inherit, And fools are bearing away shame!</verse>
