  <verse number="1">For the law having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the things; by the selfsame sacrifices which they offer continually every year, can never make the comers thereunto perfect:</verse>
  <verse number="2">For then they would have ceased to be offered: because the worshippers once cleansed should have no conscience of sin any longer:</verse>
  <verse number="3">But in them there is made a commemoration of sins every year.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For it is impossible that with the blood of oxen and goats sin should be taken away.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith: Sacrifice and oblation thou wouldest not: but a body thou hast fitted to me:</verse>
  <verse number="6">Holocausts for sin did not please thee.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then said I: Behold I come: in the head of the book it is written of me: that I should do thy will, O God.</verse>
  <verse number="8">In saying before, Sacrifices, and oblations, and holocausts for sin thou wouldest not, neither are they pleasing to thee, which are offered according to the law.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then said I: Behold, I come to do thy will, O God: he taketh away the first, that he may establish that which followeth.</verse>
  <verse number="10">In the which will, we are sanctified by the oblation of the body of Jesus Christ once.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And every priest indeed standeth daily ministering, and often offering the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But this man offering one sacrifice for sins, for ever sitteth on the right hand of God,</verse>
  <verse number="13">From henceforth expecting, until his enemies be made his footstool.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For by one oblation he hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the Holy Ghost also doth testify this to us. For after that he said:</verse>
  <verse number="16">And this is the testament which I will make unto them after those days, saith the Lord. I will give my laws in their hearts, and on their minds will I write them:</verse>
  <verse number="17">And their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Now where there is a remission of these, there is no more an oblation for sin.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Having therefore, brethren, a confidence in the entering into the holies by the blood of Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="20">A new and living way which he hath dedicated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh,</verse>
  <verse number="21">And a high priest over the house of God:</verse>
  <verse number="22">Let us draw near with a true heart in fulness of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with clean water.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering (for he is faithful that hath promised),</verse>
  <verse number="24">And let us consider one another, to provoke unto charity and to good works:</verse>
  <verse number="25">Not forsaking our assembly, as some are accustomed; but comforting one another, and so much the more as you see the day approaching.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For if we sin wilfully after having the knowledge of the truth, there is now left no sacrifice for sins,</verse>
  <verse number="27">But a certain dreadful expectation of judgment, and the rage of a fire which shall consume the adversaries.</verse>
  <verse number="28">A man making void the law of Moses, dieth without any mercy under two or three witnesses:</verse>
  <verse number="29">How much more, do you think he deserveth worse punishments, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath esteemed the blood of the testament unclean, by which he was sanctified, and hath offered an affront to the Spirit of grace?</verse>
  <verse number="30">For we know him that hath said: Vengeance belongeth to me, and I will repay. And again: The Lord shall judge his people.</verse>
  <verse number="31">It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But call to mind the former days, wherein, being illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And on the one hand indeed, by reproaches and tribulations, were made a gazingstock; and on the other, became companions of them that were used in such sort.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For you both had compassion on them that were in bands, and took with joy the being stripped of your own goods, knowing that you have a better and a lasting substance.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Do not therefore lose your confidence, which hath a great reward.</verse>
  <verse number="36">For patience is necessary for you; that, doing the will of God, you may receive the promise.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For yet a little and a very little while, and he that is to come, will come, and will not delay.</verse>
  <verse number="38">But my just man liveth by faith; but if he withdraw himself, he shall not please my soul.</verse>
  <verse number="39">But we are not the children of withdrawing unto perdition, but of faith to the saving of the soul.</verse>
