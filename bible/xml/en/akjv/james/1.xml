  <verse number="1">James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</verse>
  <verse number="2">My brothers, count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations;</verse>
  <verse number="3">Knowing this, that the trying of your faith works patience.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But let patience have her perfect work, that you may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="5">If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that gives to all men liberally, and upbraides not; and it shall be given him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavers is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="8">A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</verse>
  <verse number="10">But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it wither the grass, and the flower thereof falls, and the grace of the fashion of it perishes: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Blessed is the man that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man:</verse>
  <verse number="14">But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Do not err, my beloved brothers.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no fickleness, neither shadow of turning.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Why, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</verse>
  <verse number="20">For the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Why lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But be you doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like to a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</verse>
  <verse number="24">For he beholds himself, and goes his way, and straightway forgets what manner of man he was.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</verse>
  <verse number="26">If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</verse>
