  <verse number="1">And Jonah prayed to the Lord, his God, from the belly of the fish.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he said: “I cried out to the Lord from my tribulation, and he heeded me. From the belly of hell, I cried out, and you heeded my voice.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And you have thrown me into the deep, in the heart of the sea, and a flood has encircled me. All your whirlpools and your waves have passed over me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And I said: I am expelled from the sight of your eyes. Yet, truly, I will see your holy temple again.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The waters surrounded me, even to the soul. The abyss has walled me in. The ocean has covered my head.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I descended to the base of the mountains. The bars of the earth have enclosed me forever. And you will raise up my life from corruption, Lord, my God.</verse>
  <verse number="7">When my soul was in anguish within me, I called to mind the Lord, so that my prayer might come to you, to your holy temple.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Those who in vain observe vanities, abandon their own mercy.</verse>

  <verse number="10">And the Lord spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.</verse>
