<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Be ye not many teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive the greater judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For in many things we all stumble. If any stumble not in word, this a perfect man, able to govern by a bridle also the whole body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Behold, we put bits in the horsesâ€™ mouths, that they should yield to us; and we lead their whole body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Behold also ships, being so great, and driven by hard winds, are led by the smallest rudder, wherever the desire of him steering should will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">So also the tongue is a small member, and vaunts itself. Behold, how great a wood a little fire inflames.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">(And the tongue a fire, a world of iniquity: so the tongue is placed in our members, defiling the whole body, and burning the wheel of creation; and burned by hell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For every nature of beasts, and also of birds, of creeping things, and also of things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by the nature of man:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the tongue none of men can tame; an ungovernable evil, full of deadly poison.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">With it we praise the God and Father; and with it we curse men, those made according to the similitude of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Out of the same month comes forth blessing and cursing. There is no need, my brethren, for these things so to be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Much less from the same aperture does a fountain bubble out sweet and bitter?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The fig tree, my brethren, cannot make olives, or the vine, figs: so no fountain can make salt and sweet water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who wise and knowing among you? let him show out of a good mode of life his works in meekness of wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And if ye have bitter envy and intrigue in your heart, boast not, and lie not against the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">This is wisdom coming not down from above, but earthly, natural, resembling an evil spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For where envy and intrigue, there confusion and every bad deed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the wisdom from above is truly first pure, then peaceful, decorous, docile, full of mercy and good fruits, not separated, and unfeigned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the fruit of justice is sown in peace by those making peace.</p>
