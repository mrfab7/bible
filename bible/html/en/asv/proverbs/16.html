<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="16" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The plans of the heart belong to man; But the answer of the tongue is from Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; But Jehovah weigheth the spirits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Commit thy works unto Jehovah, And thy purposes shall be established.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Jehovah hath made everything for its own end; Yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to Jehovah: Though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">By mercy and truth iniquity is atoned for; And by the fear of Jehovah men depart from evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When a man’s ways please Jehovah, He maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Better is a little, with righteousness, Than great revenues with injustice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A man’s heart deviseth his way; But Jehovah directeth his steps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A divine sentence is in the lips of the king; His mouth shall not transgress in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">A just balance and scales are Jehovah’s; All the weights of the bag are his work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness; For the throne is established by righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Righteous lips are the delight of kings; And they love him that speaketh right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The wrath of a king is as messengers of death; But a wise man will pacify it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">In the light of the king’s countenance is life; And his favor is as a cloud of the latter rain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! Yea, to get understanding is rather to be chosen than silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: He that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Pride goeth before destruction, And a haughty spirit before a fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Better it is to be of a lowly spirit with the poor, Than to divide the spoil with the proud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He that giveth heed unto the word shall find good; And whoso trusteth in Jehovah, happy is he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The wise in heart shall be called prudent; And the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Understanding is a well-spring of life unto him that hath it; But the correction of fools is their folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The heart of the wise instructeth his mouth, And addeth learning to his lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Pleasant words are as a honeycomb, Sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, But the end thereof are the ways of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The appetite of the laboring man laboreth for him; For his mouth urgeth him thereto.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">A worthless man deviseth mischief; And in his lips there is as a scorching fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A perverse man scattereth abroad strife; And a whisperer separateth chief friends.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">A man of violence enticeth his neighbor, And leadeth him in a way that is not good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He that shutteth his eyes, it is to devise perverse things: He that compresseth his lips bringeth evil to pass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The hoary head is a crown of glory; It shall be found in the way of righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; And he that ruleth his spirit, than he that taketh a city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The lot is cast into the lap; But the whole disposing thereof is of Jehovah.</p>
