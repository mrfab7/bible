<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="32" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">So these three men stopped answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">This kindled the anger of Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram. He burned with anger against Job for justifying himself rather than God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and he burned with anger against Job’s three friends because they had failed to refute Job, and yet had condemned him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because the others were older than he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But when he saw that the three men had no further reply, his anger was kindled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">So Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite declared: “I am young in years, while you are old; that is why I was timid and afraid to tell you what I know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I thought that age should speak, and many years should teach wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But there is a spirit in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">It is not only the old who are wise, or the elderly who understand justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore I say, ‘Listen to me; I too will declare what I know.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Indeed, I waited while you spoke; I listened to your reasoning; as you searched for words,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I paid you full attention. But no one proved Job wrong; not one of you rebutted his arguments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">So do not claim, ‘We have found wisdom; let God, not man, refute him.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But Job has not directed his words against me, and I will not answer him with your arguments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Job’s friends are dismayed, with no more to say; words have escaped them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Must I wait, now that they are silent, now that they stand and no longer reply?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I too will answer; yes, I will declare what I know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For I am full of words, and my spirit within me compels me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Behold, my belly is like unvented wine; it is about to burst like a new wineskin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I must speak and find relief; I must open my lips and respond.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">I will be partial to no one, nor will I flatter any man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For I do not know how to flatter, or my Maker would remove me in an instant.</p>
