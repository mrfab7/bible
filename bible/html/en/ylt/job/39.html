<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="39" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Hast thou known the time of The bearing of the wild goats of the rock? The bringing forth of hinds thou dost mark!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thou dost number the months they fulfil? And thou hast known the time of their bringing forth!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They bow down, Their young ones they bring forth safely, Their pangs they cast forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Safe are their young ones, They grow up in the field, they have gone out, And have not returned to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who hath sent forth the wild ass free? Yea, the bands of the wild ass who opened?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Whose house I have made the wilderness, And his dwellings the barren land,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He doth laugh at the multitude of a city, The cries of an exactor he heareth not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The range of mountains is his pasture, And after every green thing he seeketh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Is a Reem willing to serve thee? Doth he lodge by thy crib?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Dost thou bind a Reem in a furrow with his thick band? Doth he harrow valleys after thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Dost thou trust in him because great is his power? And dost thou leave unto him thy labour?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Dost thou trust in him That he doth bring back thy seed? And to thy threshing-floor doth gather it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The wing of the rattling ones exulteth, Whether the pinion of the ostrich or hawk.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For she leaveth on the earth her eggs, And on the dust she doth warm them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And she forgetteth that a foot may press it, And a beast of the field tread it down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Her young ones it hath hardened without her, In vain is her labour without fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For God hath caused her to forget wisdom, And He hath not given a portion To her in understanding:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">At the time on high she lifteth herself up, She laugheth at the horse and at his rider.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Dost thou give to the horse might? Dost thou clothe his neck with a mane?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Dost thou cause him to rush as a locust? The majesty of his snorting is terrible.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">They dig in a valley, and he rejoiceth in power, He goeth forth to meet the armour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He laugheth at fear, and is not affrighted, And he turneth not back from the face of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Against him rattle doth quiver, The flame of a spear, and a halbert.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">With trembling and rage he swalloweth the ground, And remaineth not stedfast Because of the sound of a trumpet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Among the trumpets he saith, Aha, And from afar he doth smell battle, Roaring of princes and shouting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">By thine understanding flieth a hawk? Spreadeth he his wings to the south?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">At thy command goeth an eagle up high? Or lifteth he up his nest?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A rock he doth inhabit, Yea, he lodgeth on the tooth of a rock, and fortress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">From thence he hath sought food, To a far off place his eyes look attentively,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And his brood gulp up blood, And where the pierced are—there is he!</p>
