<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And all the multitude of them having risen, brought him to Pilate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying himself to be Christ a King.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou King of the Jews? And he having answered, said to him, Thou sayest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowd, I find nothing blameworthy in this man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And they were strong, saying, That he stirs up the people, teaching through the whole of Judea, beginning from Galilee to here.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Pilate having heard of Galilee, asked if the man is a Galilean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And having known that he is from Herodâ€™s authority, he sent him to Herod, he being in Jerusalem in those days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Herod having seen Jesus, rejoiced greatly: for he was wishing a long while since to see him, for hearing many things of him: and he hoped to see some sign done by him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he asked him in fitting words: and he answered him nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the chief priests and scribes stood zealously accusing him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Herod having set him at nought with his troops, and having mocked, putting about him shining clothing, sent him out to Pilate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And also Pilate and Herod were friends in that day with one another: for they were before being in enmity with each other.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Pilate having called together the chief priests and rulers and people,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Said to them, Ye have brought to me this man, as perverting the people: and, behold, I having examined him before you, have found nothing blameworthy in this man, of what things ye bring an accusation against him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But neither Herod: for I sent you forth to him; and, behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Therefore, having chastised him, I will release.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">(And he had necessity to loose one at the festival.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And they cried out with the entire multitude, saying, Take this away, and loose to us Barabbas:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">(Who was for a certain sedition having been in the city, and slaughter, cast into prison.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Again Pilate called, wishing to loose Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And they exclaimed, saying, Crucify, crucify him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And he said to them the third time, For what evil has he done I have found no cause of death in him: therefore, having corrected him, I will loose.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And they were urgent with great voices, asking for him to be crucified. And their voices and the chief priests overcame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Pilate sanctioned their asking to be done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And he loosed to them him cast into prison for sedition, and slaughter, which they demanded; and delivered Jesus to their will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And as they led him away, seizing upon Simon, a certain Cyrenian, coming from the field, they laid the cross upon him, to carry after Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And a great multitude of people followed him, and of women, and who were lamenting bitterly, and bewailing him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And having turned towards them Jesus said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For, behold, the days are coming in which they shall say, Happy the barren, and the wombs which never brought forth, and the breasts which gave not suck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall upon us; and to the hills, Cover us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For if they do these in the moist tree, what should be in the dry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And two others who were led, evil doers, to be lifted up with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And when they came to the place called Kranium, there they crucified him, and the evil doers, truly one from the right, and one from the left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And Jesus said, Father, let them go; for they know not what they do. And having divided his garments, they cast lots.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also who with them were deriding, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he is Christ, the chosen of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And the soldiers also mocked him, approaching, and bringing him vinegar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And saying, If thou art king of the Jews, save thyself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And there was also an inscription written upon him, in letters Greek, Roman, and Hebrew; THIS IS KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And one of the evil doers hanged, blasphemed him, saying, If thou art Christ, save thyself and us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And the other having answered, censured him, saying, Shouldest thou not fear God, for thou art in the same judgment?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And truly we justly; for we receive things worthy of what we have done: and this has done nothing out of place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And he said to Jesus, Remember me, Lord, when thou shouldest come into thy kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And Jesus said to him, Truly I say to you, This day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And it was about the sixth hour, and darkness was upon all the earth till the ninth hour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">And the sun was darkened, and the covering of the temple was split in the middle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">And Jesus having cried with a great voice, said, Father, into thy hands will I commit my spirit: and having said these, he expired.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">And the centurion having seen that having been done, honoured God, saying, Surely this man was just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">And all the crowds having been to this viewing, seeing the things done, striking their breasts, returned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">And all his acquaintance stood afar off, and the women having followed him together from Galilee, seeing these.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">And, behold, a man Joseph by name, being a counsellor; good and just:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">(The same was not set together in the counsel and deed of them;) from Arimathea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">The same having come to Pilate, asked the body of Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">And having taken it down, he wrapped it in fine linen, and put it in a tomb cut in stone, where none was ever laid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">And the day was the preparation, and the sabbath shone forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">And the women having followed, which had come to him out of Galilee, saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">And having returned, they prepared spices and perfumed oils; and truly the sabbath were they at rest according to the command.</p>
