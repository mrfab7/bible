<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Azariah son of Oded, upon him was the spirit of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he will go forth before Asa, and say to him, Hear ye me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; Jehovah is with you in your being with him; and if ye will seek him he will be found to you; and if ye will forsake him, he will forsake you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And many days to Israel for not a God of truth, and for no priest teaching, and for no law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he will turn back in straits to him upon Jehovah God of Israel, and they will seek him and he will be found to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And in these times no peace to him going out, and to him coming in, for much consternation upon all inhabiting the lands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And they dashed themselves, nation upon nation, and city upon city: for God disturbed them with all straits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And ye, be ye strong, and your hands shall not be relaxed; for there is a reward to your work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he strengthened himself, and he will put away the abominations from all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and from the cities which he took from mount Ephraim, and he will renew the altar of Jehovah which was before the porch of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he will gather all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them from Ephraim and Manasseh and from Simeon: for they fell to him from Israel for multitude in their seeing that Jehovah his God was with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And they will gather together at Jerusalem in the third month, for the fifteenth year to the kingdom of Asa.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And they will sacrifice to Jehovah in that day from the spoil they brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And they will come into a covenant to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And every one who will not seek for Jehovah God of Israel shall be put to death, from small and even to great, from man and even to woman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And they will swear to Jehovah with a great voice, and with shouting and with trumpets and with horns.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And all Judah will rejoice at the oath: for with all their heart they sware, and with all their desire they sought him, and he will be found to them: and Jehovah will give rest to them from round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And also Maachah, Asaâ€™s mother, the king removed her from queen because she made terror for a statue: and Asa will cut off her terror, and beat small, and burn in the torrent Kidron.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the heights were not removed from Israel: but the heart of Asa was complete all his days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he will bring the holies of his father, and his holies, into the house of God, silver and gold and vessels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And war was not even to the thirty and fifth year to the kingdom of Asa.</p>
