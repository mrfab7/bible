  <verse number="2">And he struck Moab, and he measured them with a line, leveling them to the ground. Now he measured with two lines, one to kill, and one to keep alive. And Moab was made to serve David under tribute.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And David struck Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, the king of Zobah, when he set out to rule over the river Euphrates.</verse>

  <verse number="8">And from Betah and Beeroth, cities of Hadadezer, king David took an exceedingly great amount of brass.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then Toi, the king of Hamath, heard that David had struck down the entire strength of Hadadezer.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And so, Toi sent his son Joram to king David, so that he might greet him with congratulations, and give thanks, because he had fought against Hadadezer and had struck him down. For indeed, Toi was the enemy of Hadadezer. And in his hand were vessels of gold, and vessels of silver, and vessels of brass.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And king David also sanctified these things to the Lord, with the silver and gold that he had sanctified from all the peoples whom he had subdued:</verse>

  <verse number="15">And David reigned over all of Israel. And David accomplished judgment and justice with all his people.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Now Joab, the son Zeruiah, was over the army. And Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the keeper of records.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Zadok, the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar, were the priests. And Seraiah was the scribe.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was over the Cherethites and Pelethites. But the sons of David were priests.</verse>
