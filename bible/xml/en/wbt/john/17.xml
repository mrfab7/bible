  <verse number="1">These words spoke Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:</verse>
  <verse number="2">As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And this is life eternal, that they may know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thy ownself, with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I have manifested thy name to the men whom thou gavest to me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them to me; and they have kept thy word.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now they have known that all things whatever thou hast given me are from thee.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For I have given to them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them whom thou hast given to me; for they are thine.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thy own name those whom thou hast given to me, that they may be one, as we are.</verse>
  <verse number="12">While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest to me I have kept, and none of them is lost but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And now I come to thee, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I have given to them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I pray not that thou shouldst take them out of the world, but that thou shouldst keep them from the evil.</verse>
  <verse number="16">They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</verse>
  <verse number="18">As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified through the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Neither pray I for these alone; but for them also who shall believe on me through their word.</verse>
  <verse number="21">That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the glory which thou gavest to me, I have given to them; that they may be one, even as we are one.</verse>
  <verse number="23">I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them as thou hast loved me.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Father, I will that they also whom thou hast given to me be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory which thou hast given to me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="25">O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And I have declared to them thy name, and will declare it: that the love with which thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I in them.</verse>
