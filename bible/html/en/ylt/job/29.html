<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="29" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job addeth to lift up his simile, and saith:—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Who doth make me as in months past, As in the days of God’s preserving me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">In His causing His lamp to shine on my head, By His light I walk through darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">As I have been in days of my maturity, And the counsel of God upon my tent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">When yet the Mighty One is with me. Round about me—my young ones,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When washing my goings with butter, And the firm rock is with me rivulets of oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When I go out to the gate by the city, In a broad place I prepare my seat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Seen me have youths, and they, been hidden, And the aged have risen—they stood up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Princes have kept in words, And a hand they place on their mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The voice of leaders hath been hidden, And their tongue to the palate hath cleaved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the ear heard, and declareth me happy, And the eye hath seen, and testifieth to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For I deliver the afflicted who is crying, And the fatherless who hath no helper.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The blessing of the perishing cometh on me, And the heart of the widow I cause to sing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Righteousness I have put on, and it clotheth me, As a robe and a diadem my justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Eyes I have been to the blind, And feet to the lame am I.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A father I am to the needy, And the cause I have not known I search out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And I break the jaw-teeth of the perverse, And from his teeth I cast away prey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And I say, ‘With my nest I expire, And as the sand I multiply days.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">My root is open unto the waters, And dew doth lodge on my branch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My honour is fresh with me, And my bow in my hand is renewed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">To me they have hearkened, Yea, they wait, and are silent for my counsel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">After my word they change not, And on them doth my speech drop,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And they wait as for rain for me, And their mouth they have opened wide As for the latter rain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">I laugh unto them—they give no credence, And the light of my face cause not to fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">I choose their way, and sit head, And I dwell as a king in a troop, When mourners he doth comfort.</p>
