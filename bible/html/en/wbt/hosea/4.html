<div class="chapter" data-book="Hosea" data-chapter="4" data-translation="Webster Bible Translation" data-translation-id="wbt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth in it shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yes, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Yet let no man contend, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they that contend with the priest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall be guilty of lewdness, and shall not increase: because they have ceased to take heed to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Lewdness and wine and new wine take away the heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth to them: for the spirit of lewdness hath caused them to err, and they have gone astray from under their God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shade of them is agreeable: therefore your daughters shall be guilty of lewdness, and your spouses shall commit adultery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I will not punish your daughters when they are guilty of lewdness, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for they themselves are separated with prostitutes, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Though thou, Israel, playest the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye to Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Their drink is sour: they have been guilty of lewd deeds continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.</p>
