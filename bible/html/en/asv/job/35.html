<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover Elihu answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thinkest thou this to be thy right, Or sayest thou, My righteousness is more than Godâ€™s,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">That thou sayest, What advantage will it be unto thee? And, What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I will answer thee, And thy companions with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Look unto the heavens, and see; And behold the skies, which are higher than thou.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If thou hast sinned, what effectest thou against him? And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? Or what receiveth he of thy hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; And thy righteousness may profit a son of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But none saith, Where is God my Maker, Who giveth songs in the night,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, And maketh us wiser than the birds of the heavens?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">There they cry, but none giveth answer, Because of the pride of evil men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Surely God will not hear an empty cry, Neither will the Almighty regard it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">How much less when thou sayest thou beholdest him not, The cause is before him, and thou waitest for him!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But now, because he hath not visited in his anger, Neither doth he greatly regard arrogance;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vanity; He multiplieth words without knowledge.</p>
