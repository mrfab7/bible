<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the day will be and the sons of God will come to stand before Jehovah, and the adversary also will come in the midst of them to stand before Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Jehovah will say to the adversary, From whence wilt thou come? And the adversary will answer to Jehovah and say, From running to and fro in the earth, and from walking about in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Jehovah will say to the adversary, Didst thou set thy heart to my servant Job, that none like him in the earth, a man blameless and upright, fearing God and departing from evil? And yet he holding fast upon his integrity, and thou wilt stimulate me to destroy him without cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the adversary will answer Jehovah and say, Skin for skin, and all which is to a man he will give for his soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But send forth now thy hand and touch upon his bone and upon his flesh, if he will not bless thee to thy face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Jehovah will say to the adversary, Behold him in thy hand, but watch his soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the adversary will go forth from the face of Jehovah, and he will strike Job with an evil burning sore, from the sole of his foot even to his crown.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he will take to him a pot sherd to scrape himself with it, and he will sit in the midst of the ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And his wife will say to him, Yet thou art holding fast upon thine integrity: praise God and die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he will say to her, According to the word of one of the foolish women thou wilt speak. Shall we also receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this. Job sinned not with his lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the three friends of Job will hear all this evil coming upon him, and they will come, a man from his place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: and they will appoint to come together to deplore for him, and to comfort him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And they will lift up their eyes from far off, and they knew him not, and they will lift up their voice and weep; and they will rend each his covering, and they will sprinkle dust upon their heads to the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And they sat with him upon, the earth seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word to him: for they saw that grief was great exceedingly.</p>
