<chapter book="Job" number="9" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And Job will answer and say,</verse>
  <verse number="2">I knew that so the truth: and how shall man be just with God?</verse>
  <verse number="3">If he shall desire to contend with him, he shall not answer him one from a thousand.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Wise of heart and strong of power: who was hard before him and shall be requited?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Removing the mountains and they knew not: who overturned them in his anger;</verse>
  <verse number="6">Moving the earth from her place, and her pillars will tremble;</verse>
  <verse number="7">Saying to the sun, and it shall not rise; and for the stars he will seal them up.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He alone spread out the heavens and he trod upon the heights of the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He made Ash-Chesil and Cimah, and the chambers of the south;</verse>
  <verse number="10">He did great things even not searched out; and wonders even no number.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Behold, he will pass by me, and I shall not see: and he will glide on and I shall not understand for him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Behold, he will catch and who shall turn him? and who shall say to him, What wilt thou do?</verse>
  <verse number="13">God will not turn back his anger, the helpers of pride bowed down under him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">How much less shall I answer him, shall I choose my words with him?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Whom, if I was just, I shall not answer; I will make supplication to my judge.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If I called and he will answer me, I shall not believe that he will give ear to my voice.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Who will assail me with tempest, and he multiplied my wounds without cause.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He will not give me to draw in my spirit, for he will fill me with bitterness.</verse>
  <verse number="19">If for strength, behold him strong: if for judgment, who shall arraign me.</verse>
  <verse number="20">If I shall be just, my mouth shall condemn me: I am blameless, and he will declare me perverse.</verse>
  <verse number="21">I am blameless, I shall not know my soul: I shall despise my life.</verse>
  <verse number="22">It is one: for this, I said, The blameless one and the unjust one he finishes.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If the scourge shall fall suddenly, he will deride at the trial of the innocent.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The earth was given into the hand of the unjust one: he will cover the faces of her judges; if not now, who is it?</verse>
  <verse number="25">My days were swift above a runner: they fled, they saw not good.</verse>
  <verse number="26">They glided along with the ships of desire: as the eagle will pounce upon food.</verse>
  <verse number="27">If my saying, I will forget my complaint, I will let go my face, and I will be cheerful:</verse>
  <verse number="28">I was afraid of all my pains, I knew that thou wilt not acquit me.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Shall I do evil, wherefore this shall I labor in vain?</verse>
  <verse number="30">If I washed myself in snow-water, and cleansed my hands clean;</verse>
  <verse number="31">Then thou wilt immerse me in the ditch, and my garments abhorred me.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For not a man as I; I shall answer him, we shall come together in judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="33">There is not between us a reprover; he will put his hand upon us two.</verse>
  <verse number="34">He will take away his rod from me, and his truth shall not make me afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="35">I will speak, and I shall not fear him; but not so am I with myself.</verse>
