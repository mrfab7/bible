  <verse number="2">And the third, which was to the king leaning upon his hand, will answer the man of God, and say, Behold, Jehovah making lattices in the heavens, will this word be? and he will say, Behold thee seeing with thine eyes, and from thence thou shalt not eat.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And there were four men being leprous at the entrance of the gate, and they will say a man to his neighbor, What, shall we sit here till our death?</verse>
  <verse number="4">If we said, We will go into the city, and the famine in the city, and our death there: and if we sat here, and we died. And now come, and we will fall to the camp of Aram: if they will save us alive we shall live; and if they will kill us, and we died.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And they will rise in darkness to go to the camp of Aram: and they will come even to the end of the camp of Aram, and behold, not a man there.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Jehovah caused the camp of Aram to hear a voice of chariot and a voice of horse, a voice of great strength: and they will say a man to his brother, Behold, the king of Israel hired the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come upon us.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they will rise and flee in darkness, and leave their tents, and their horses and their asses, the camp as it was, and flee for their soul.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And these leprous will come even to the end of the camp, and go to one tent, and eat and drink and lift up from thence silver and gold, and garments, and they will go and hide and turn back, and come to another tent, and lift up from thence, and go and hide.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they will say a man to his neighbor, Not thus do we: this day, it is a day of glad tidings, and we being silent: and waiting till morning light and sin will find us: an now come and we will go and announce to the king’s house.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they will go and call to the gate of the city and announce to them, saying, We came to the camp of Aram, and behold, not a man there, and voice of man, but the horse made fast, and the ass made fast, and the tents as they are.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it will be called out at the gates, and they will announce to the king’s house within.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the king will rise by night and say to his servants, I will now announce to you what Aram did to us. They knew that we are hungry, and they went forth from the camp to hide in the field, saying, When they shall come forth from the city and we will seize them living, and we will go info the city.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And one of his servants will answer and say, They shall take five of the horses remaining which were left in it, (behold them as all the multitude of Israel which were left in it: behold them as all the multitude of Israel which were finished:) and we will send and see.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And they will take two chariot horses, and the king will send after the camp of Aram, saying, Go and see.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And they will go after them even to Jordan; and behold, all the way full of garments and vessels which Aram cast away in their being terrified. And the messengers will turn back and announce to the king.</verse>

  <verse number="17">And the king appointed the third who leaned upon his hand over the gate: and the people will tread upon him in the gate: and he will die according to the word of the man of God who spake in the king’s coming down to him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And it will be as the man of God spake to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel will be about the time tomorrow in the gate of Shomeron.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the third will answer the man of God and say, Behold, Jehovah making lattices in the heavens, will it be according to this word? and he will say, Behold thee seeing with thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat from thence.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And thus it will be to him and the people will tread upon him in the gate, and he will die.</verse>
