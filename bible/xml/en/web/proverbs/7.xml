<chapter book="Proverbs" number="7" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My son, keep my words. Lay up my commandments within you.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Keep my commandments and live! Guard my teaching as the apple of your eye.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Bind them on your fingers. Write them on the tablet of your heart.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Tell wisdom, “You are my sister.” Call understanding your relative,</verse>
  <verse number="5">that they may keep you from the strange woman, from the foreigner who flatters with her words.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For at the window of my house, I looked out through my lattice.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I saw among the simple ones. I discerned among the youths a young man void of understanding,</verse>
  <verse number="8">passing through the street near her corner, he went the way to her house,</verse>
  <verse number="9">in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the middle of the night and in the darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Behold, there a woman met him with the attire of a prostitute, and with crafty intent.</verse>
  <verse number="11">She is loud and defiant. Her feet don’t stay in her house.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now she is in the streets, now in the squares, and lurking at every corner.</verse>
  <verse number="13">So she caught him, and kissed him. With an impudent face she said to him:</verse>
  <verse number="14">“Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me. This day I have paid my vows.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Therefore I came out to meet you, to diligently seek your face, and I have found you.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Come, let’s take our fill of loving until the morning. Let’s solace ourselves with loving.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For my husband isn’t at home. He has gone on a long journey.</verse>
  <verse number="20">He has taken a bag of money with him. He will come home at the full moon.”</verse>
  <verse number="21">With persuasive words, she led him astray. With the flattering of her lips, she seduced him.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He followed her immediately, as an ox goes to the slaughter, as a fool stepping into a noose.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Until an arrow strikes through his liver, as a bird hurries to the snare, and doesn’t know that it will cost his life.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Now therefore, sons, listen to me. Pay attention to the words of my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Don’t let your heart turn to her ways. Don’t go astray in her paths,</verse>
  <verse number="26">for she has thrown down many wounded. Yes, all her slain are a mighty army.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the rooms of death.</verse>
