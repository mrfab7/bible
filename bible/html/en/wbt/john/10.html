<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Verily, verily, I say to you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheep-fold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">But he that entereth by the door, is the shepherd of the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">This parable spoke Jesus to them: but they understood not what things they were which he spoke to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Then said Jesus to them again, Verily, verily, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I am the door: by me if any man shall enter he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The thief cometh not, but to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But he that is a hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth, and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The hireling fleeth, because he is a hireling, and careth not for the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known by mine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">As the Father knoweth me, even so I know the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And other sheep I have which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received from my Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And many of them said, He hath a demon, and is insane; why hear ye him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Then came the Jews around him, and said to him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I did in my Father’s name, they testify concerning me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And I give to them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of my hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">My Father, who gave them to me, is greater than all; and none is able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">I and my Father are one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shown you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy, and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Therefore they sought again to take him; but he escaped from their hand,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And went again beyond Jordan, into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And many resorted to him, and said, John performed no miracle; but all things that John spoke of this man were true.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And many believed on him there.</p>
