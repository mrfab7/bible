<chapter book="3 John" number="1" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The elder unto Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Beloved, I pray that in all things thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For I rejoiced greatly, when brethren came and bare witness unto thy truth, even as thou walkest in truth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Greater joy have I none than this, to hear of my children walking in the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Beloved, thou doest a faithful work in whatsoever thou doest toward them that are brethren and strangers withal;</verse>
  <verse number="6">who bare witness to thy love before the church: whom thou wilt do well to set forward on their journey worthily of God:</verse>
  <verse number="7">because that for the sake of the Name they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</verse>
  <verse number="8">We therefore ought to welcome such, that we may be fellow-workers with the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I wrote somewhat unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore, if I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he doeth, prating against us with wicked words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and them that would he forbiddeth, and casteth them out of the church.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Beloved, imitate not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that doeth good is of God: he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Demetrius hath the witness of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, we also bear witness; and thou knowest that our witness is true.</verse>
  <verse number="13">I had many things to write unto thee, but I am unwilling to write them to thee with ink and pen:</verse>
  <verse number="14">but I hope shortly to see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be unto thee. The friends salute thee. Salute the friends by name.</verse>
