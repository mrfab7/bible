  <verse number="1">Then Job answered, and said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Whose helper art thou? is it of him that is weak? and dost thou hold up the arm of him that has no strength?</verse>
  <verse number="3">To whom hast thou given counsel? perhaps to him that hath no wisdom, and thou hast shewn thy very great prudence.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Whom hast thou desired to teach? was it not him that made life?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Behold the giants groan under the waters, and they that dwell with them.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Hell is naked before him, and there is no covering for destruction.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He stretched out the north over the empty space, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He bindeth up the waters in his clouds, so that they break not out and fall down together.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He withholdeth the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud over it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He hath set bounds about the waters, till light and darkness come to an end.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The pillars of heaven tremble, and dread at his beck.</verse>
  <verse number="12">By his power the seas are suddenly gathered together, and his wisdom has struck the proud one.</verse>
  <verse number="13">His spirit hath adorned the heavens, and his obstetric hand brought forth the winding serpent.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Lo, these things are said in part of his ways: and seeing we have heard scarce a little drop of his word, who shall be able to behold the thunder of his greatness?</verse>
