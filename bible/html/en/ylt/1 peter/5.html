<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Elders who are among you, I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of the Christ, and of the glory about to be revealed a partaker,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">feed the flock of God that is among you, overseeing not constrainedly, but willingly, neither for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">neither as exercising lordship over the heritages, but patterns becoming of the flock,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and at the manifestation of the chief Shepherd, ye shall receive the unfading crown of glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">In like manner, ye younger, be subject to elders, and all to one another subjecting yourselves; with humble-mindedness clothe yourselves, because God the proud doth resist, but to the humble He doth give grace;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">be humbled, then, under the powerful hand of God, that you He may exalt in good time,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">all your care having cast upon Him, because He careth for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Be sober, vigilant, because your opponent the devil, as a roaring lion, doth walk about, seeking whom he may swallow up,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">whom resist, stedfast in the faith, having known the same sufferings to your brotherhood in the world to be accomplished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the God of all grace, who did call you to His age-during glory in Christ Jesus, having suffered a little, Himself make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">to Him is the glory, and the powerâ€”to the ages and the ages! Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Through Silvanus, to you the faithful brother, as I reckon, through few words I did write, exhorting and testifying this to be the true grace of God in which ye have stood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Salute you doth the assembly in Babylon jointly elected, and Markus my son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Salute ye one another in a kiss of love; peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus! Amen.</p>
