<chapter book="Hosea" number="7" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">When I would heal Israel, then is the iniquity of Ephraim discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria; for they commit falsehood: and the thief entereth in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now have their own doings beset them about; they are before my face.</verse>
  <verse number="3">They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</verse>
  <verse number="4">They are all adulterers; they are as an oven heated by the baker; he ceaseth to stir the fire, from the kneading of the dough until it be leavened.</verse>
  <verse number="5">On the day of our king the princes made themselves sick with the heat of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They are all hot as an oven, and devour their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Ephraim, he mixeth himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and he knoweth it not.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: yet they have not returned unto the LORD their God, nor sought him, for all this.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Ephraim is like a silly dove, without understanding: they call unto Egypt, they go to Assyria.</verse>
  <verse number="12">When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven: I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Woe unto them! for they have wandered from me; destruction unto them! for they have trespassed against me: though I would redeem them, yet they have spoken lies against me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And they have not cried unto me with their heart, but they howl upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, they rebel against me.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Though I have taught and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.</verse>
  <verse number="16">They return, but not to him that is on high; they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</verse>
