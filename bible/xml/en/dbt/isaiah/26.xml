<chapter book="Isaiah" number="26" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah: We have a strong city; salvation doth he appoint for walls and bulwarks.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Open ye the gates, and the righteous nation which keepeth faithfulness shall enter in.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thou wilt keep in perfect peace the mind stayed [on thee], for he confideth in thee.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Confide ye in Jehovah for ever; for in Jah, Jehovah, is the rock of ages.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low, he layeth it low to the ground, he bringeth it even to the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The foot shall tread it down,—the feet of the afflicted, the steps of the poor.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The way of the just is uprightness: thou, the Upright, dost make the path of the just even.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O Jehovah, have we waited for thee; the desire of [our] soul is to thy name, and to thy memorial.</verse>
  <verse number="9">With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If favour be shewn to the wicked, he doth not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness he dealeth unjustly, and beholdeth not the majesty of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Jehovah, thy hand is lifted up, but they do not see: [yet] they shall see [thy] jealousy [for] the people, and be ashamed; yea, the fire which is for thine adversaries shall devour them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Jehovah, thou wilt ordain peace for us; for thou also hast wrought all our works for us.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Jehovah our God, other lords than thee have had dominion over us; by thee only will we make mention of thy name.</verse>
  <verse number="14">[They are] dead, they shall not live; deceased, they shall not rise: for thou hast visited and destroyed them, and made all memory of them to perish.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thou hast increased the nation, Jehovah, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified. Thou hadst removed [it] far [unto] all the ends of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Jehovah, in trouble they sought thee; they poured out [their] whispered prayer when thy chastening was upon them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">As a woman with child, that draweth near her delivery, is in travail, [and] crieth out in her pangs; so have we been before thee, Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="18">We have been with child, we have been in travail, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought the deliverance of the land, neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Thy dead shall live, my dead bodies shall arise. Awake and sing in triumph, ye that dwell in dust; for thy dew is the dew of the morning, and the earth shall cast forth the dead.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Come, my people, enter into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee; hide thyself just for a little moment, until the indignation be past.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For behold, Jehovah cometh out of his place to visit the iniquity of the inhabitants of the earth upon them; and the earth shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.</verse>
