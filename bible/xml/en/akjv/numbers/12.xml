  <verse number="7">My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.</verse>
  <verse number="8">With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?</verse>
