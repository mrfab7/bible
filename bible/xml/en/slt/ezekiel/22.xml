  <verse number="1">And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the city of bloods, and make her to know all her abominations?</verse>
  <verse number="3">And say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: The city poured out blood in the midst of her, for her time to come; and she made blocks for herself to be defiled.</verse>
  <verse number="4">In thy blood which thou didst pour out thou went guilty; and by thy blocks which thou didst make thou wert defiled; and thou wilt cause thy days to draw near, and thou wilt come even to thy years: for this, I gave thee a reproach to the nations, and a derision to all the lands.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Those being near and those being far off from thee will scoff at thee; thou wert defiled of name and much in consternation.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Behold, the princes of Israel they were a man to his arm to pour out blood in thee.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They made light of father and mother in thee: they did with violence to the stranger in the midst of thee: they oppressed the orphan and the widow in thee.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thou didst despise my holy place, and thou didst profane my Sabbaths.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Men of slander were in thee to pour forth blood: and they ate upon the mountains in thee: they did wickedness in the midst of thee.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Thy father’s nakedness was uncovered in thee: they humbled her set apart for uncleanness in thee.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And a man did abomination with his neighbor’s wife; and a man defiled his daughter-in-law in wickedness; and a man humbled his sister, his father’s daughter, in thee.</verse>
  <verse number="12">They took a gift in thee to pour out blood; thou tookest usury and interest, and thou wilt plunder thy neighbors by violence, and thou didst forget me, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And behold, I struck my hand at thy plunder which thou madest, and at thy blood which was in the midst of thee.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Will thy heart stand, or will thine hands be strong for the day which I do with thee? I Jehovah spoke, and I did.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And I scattered thee in the nations, and I dispersed thee in the lands, and I consumed thy uncleanness out of thee.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And thou didst inherit in thee before the eyes of the nations, and thou knewest that I am Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="18">Son of man, the house of Israel became to me for dross: all they brass and alloy, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they were drosses of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: because all of them were for drosses, for this, behold me gathering you into the midst of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The gathering silver and brass and iron and lead and alloy to the midst of the furnace to blow the fire upon it, to melt; so will I gather in mine anger and in my wrath, and I put down and melted you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And I gathered you and blew upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye were melted in her midst.</verse>
  <verse number="22">As silver being melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in her midst; And ye knew that I Jehovah poured out my wrath upon you.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="24">Son of man, say to her, Thou a land not being cleansed; it was not rained upon in the day of anger.</verse>
  <verse number="25">A conspiracy of her prophets in her midst as a roaring lion rending the prey; they consumed the soul; they will take the wealth and the precious thing; they multiplied her widows in her midst.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Her priests did violence to my law, and they will profane my holy place: between the holy to the profane they separated not, and they did not make known between the unclean to the clean, and from my Sabbath they hid their eyes, and I shall be profaned in the midst of them.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Her chiefs in her midst as wolves rending the prey, to pour out blood, to destroy souls, for the sake of plundering plunder.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And her prophets plastered plaster upon them, seeing vanity, and divining to them falsehood, saying Thus said the Lord Jehovah; and Jehovah spoke not.</verse>
  <verse number="29">The people of the land oppressed with violence and stripped off robbery, and oppressed the poor and needy, and did violence to the stranger without judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And I sought from them a man to wall in the wall, and to stand in the breach before my face for the land, not to destroy it: and I found not.</verse>
  <verse number="31">I will pour out my wrath upon them; I consumed them in the fire of mine anger: I gave their way upon their head, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
