<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Beth-el, and dwell there: and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and let us arise, and go up to Beth-el; and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And they journeyed: and a great terror was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan (the same is Beth-el), he and all the people that were with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he built there an altar, and called the place El-beth-el: because there God was revealed unto him, when he fled from the face of his brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried below Beth-el under the oak: and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his name Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">and the land which I gave unto Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And God went up from him in the place where he spake with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spake with him, a pillar of stone: and he poured out a drink offering thereon, and poured oil thereon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth-el.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And they journeyed from Beth-el; and there was still some way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; for now thou shalt have another son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing (for she died), that she called his name Ben-oni: but his father called him Benjamin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath (the same is Beth-lehem).</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave: the same is the Pillar of Rachel’s grave unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And it came to pass, while Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine: and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">the sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">the sons of Rachel; Joseph and Benjamin:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid; Dan and Naphtali:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid; Gad and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Paddan-aram.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And Jacob came unto Isaac his father to Mamre, to Kiriath-arba (the same is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people, old and full of days: and Esau and Jacob his sons buried him.</p>
