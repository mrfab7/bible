<div class="chapter" data-book="2 Timothy" data-chapter="3" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Without natural affection, truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Traitors, heady, high minded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest to all men, as theirs also was.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But you have fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, long-suffering, charity, patience,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Persecutions, afflictions, which came to me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Yes, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But continue you in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing of whom you have learned them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And that from a child you have known the holy scriptures, which are able to make you wise to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished to all good works.</p>
