<p class="verse" data-verse="1">For behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall turn again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I will also gather all the nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and I will enter into judgment with them there on account of my people and mine inheritance, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations: and they have parted my land;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and they have cast lots for my people, and have given a boy for a harlot, and sold a girl for wine, and have drunk [it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Yea also, what have ye to do with me, O Tyre and Zidon, and all the districts of Philistia? Will ye render me a recompence? But if ye recompense me, swiftly [and] speedily will I bring your recompence upon your own head;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried into your temples my beautiful pleasant things,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the children of the Greeks, that ye might remove them far from their border.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, I will raise them up out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will bring your recompence upon your own head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a nation far off: for Jehovah hath spoken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Proclaim this among the nations: prepare war, arouse the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near, let them come up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Beat your ploughshares into swords, and your pruning-knives into spears; let the weak say, I am strong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Haste ye and come, all ye nations round about, and gather yourselves together. Thither cause thy mighty ones to come down, O Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let the nations rouse themselves, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the nations round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Put in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down, for the press is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness is great.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of Jehovah is at hand in the valley of decision.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Jehovah will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: and Jehovah will be a shelter for his people, and the refuge of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And ye shall know that I, Jehovah, [am] your God, dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain; and Jerusalem shall be holy, and no strangers shall pass through her any more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the water-courses of Judah shall flow with waters; and a fountain shall come forth from the house of Jehovah, and shall water the valley of Shittim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, in that they have shed innocent blood in their land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But Judah shall abide for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And I will purge them from the blood from which I had not purged them: for Jehovah dwelleth in Zion.</p>
