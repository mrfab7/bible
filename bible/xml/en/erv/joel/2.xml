<chapter book="Joel" number="2" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand;</verse>
  <verse number="2">a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness, as the dawn spread upon the mountains; a great people and a strong, there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more after them, even to the years of many generations.</verse>
  <verse number="3">A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and none hath escaped them.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so do they run.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.</verse>
  <verse number="6">At their presence the peoples are in anguish: all faces are waxed pale.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They run like mighty men; they climb the wall like men of war; and they march every one on his ways, and they break not their ranks.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Neither doth one thrust another; they march every one in his path: and they burst through the weapons, and break not off their course.</verse>
  <verse number="9">They leap upon the city; they run upon the wall; they climb up into the houses; they enter in at the windows like a thief.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The earth quaketh before them; the heavens tremble: the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining:</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the LORD uttereth his voice before his army; for his camp is very great; for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Yet even now, saith the LORD, turn ye unto me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:</verse>
  <verse number="13">and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the LORD your God, for he is gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy, and repenteth him of the evil.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Who knoweth whether he will not turn and repent, and leave a blessing behind him, even a meal offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your God?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:</verse>
  <verse number="16">gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the old men, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the nations should rule over them: wherefore should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Then was the LORD jealous for his land, and had pity on his people.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the LORD answered and said unto his people, Behold, I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations:</verse>
  <verse number="20">but I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive him into a land barren and desolate, his forepart into the eastern sea, and his hinder part into the western sea; and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great things.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice; for the LORD hath done great things.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he giveth you the former rain in just measure, and he causeth to come down for you the rain, the former rain and the latter rain, in the first month.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am the LORD your God, and there is none else: and my people shall never be ashamed.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:</verse>
  <verse number="29">and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.</verse>
  <verse number="31">The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem there shall be those that escape, as the LORD hath said, and among the remnant those whom the LORD doth call.</verse>
