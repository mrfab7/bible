  <verse number="1">Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead.</verse>
  <verse number="2">So they made him a supper there: and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of spikenard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, which should betray him, saith,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now this he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put therein.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he was there: and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death;</verse>
  <verse number="11">because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="12">On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</verse>
  <verse number="13">took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</verse>
  <verse number="15">Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.</verse>
  <verse number="16">These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare witness.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For this cause also the multitude went and met him, for that they heard that he had done this sign.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Behold how ye prevail nothing: lo, the world is gone after him.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast:</verse>
  <verse number="21">these therefore came to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: Andrew cometh, and Philip, and they tell Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Jesus answereth them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="25">He that loveth his life loseth it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</verse>
  <verse number="26">If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will the Father honour.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</verse>
  <verse number="29">The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Jesus answered and said, This voice hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto myself.</verse>
  <verse number="33">But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die.</verse>
  <verse number="34">The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</verse>
  <verse number="35">Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</verse>
  <verse number="36">While ye have the light, believe on the light, that ye may become sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and he departed and hid himself from them.</verse>
  <verse number="37">But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they believed not on him:</verse>
  <verse number="38">that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</verse>
  <verse number="39">For this cause they could not believe, for that Isaiah said again,</verse>
  <verse number="40">He hath blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart; Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, And should turn, And I should heal them.</verse>
  <verse number="41">These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory; and he spake of him.</verse>
  <verse number="42">Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</verse>
  <verse number="43">for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="46">I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And if any man hear my sayings, and keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</verse>
  <verse number="48">He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall judge him in the last day.</verse>
  <verse number="49">For I spake not from myself; but the Father which sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</verse>
  <verse number="50">And I know that his commandment is life eternal: the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I speak.</verse>
