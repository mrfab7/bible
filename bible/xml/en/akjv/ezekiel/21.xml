  <verse number="1">And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and drop your word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,</verse>
  <verse number="3">And say to the land of Israel, Thus said the LORD; Behold, I am against you, and will draw forth my sword out of his sheath, and will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Seeing then that I will cut off from you the righteous and the wicked, therefore shall my sword go forth out of his sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:</verse>
  <verse number="5">That all flesh may know that I the LORD have drawn forth my sword out of his sheath: it shall not return any more.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Sigh therefore, you son of man, with the breaking of your loins; and with bitterness sigh before their eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And it shall be, when they say to you, Why sigh you? that you shall answer, For the tidings; because it comes: and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it comes, and shall be brought to pass, said the Lord GOD.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="9">Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus said the LORD; Say, A sword, a sword is sharpened, and also furbished:</verse>
  <verse number="10">It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter; it is furbished that it may glitter: should we then make mirth? it scorns the rod of my son, as every tree.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he has given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Cry and howl, son of man: for it shall be on my people, it shall be on all the princes of Israel: terrors by reason of the sword shall be on my people: smite therefore on your thigh.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Because it is a trial, and what if the sword scorn even the rod? it shall be no more, said the Lord GOD.</verse>
  <verse number="14">You therefore, son of man, prophesy, and smite your hands together. and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain: it is the sword of the great men that are slain, which enters into their privy chambers.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I have set the point of the sword against all their gates, that their heart may faint, and their ruins be multiplied: ah! it is made bright, it is wrapped up for the slaughter.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Go you one way or other, either on the right hand, or on the left, wherever your face is set.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest: I the LORD have said it.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The word of the LORD came to me again, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="19">Also, you son of man, appoint you two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may come: both two shall come forth out of one land: and choose you a place, choose it at the head of the way to the city.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbath of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the defended.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination: he made his arrows bright, he consulted with images, he looked in the liver.</verse>
  <verse number="22">At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth in the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And it shall be to them as a false divination in their sight, to them that have sworn oaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity, that they may be taken.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Because you have made your iniquity to be remembered, in that your transgressions are discovered, so that in all your doings your sins do appear; because, I say, that you are come to remembrance, you shall be taken with the hand.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And you, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come, when iniquity shall have an end,</verse>
  <verse number="26">Thus said the Lord GOD; Remove the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall not be the same: exalt him that is low, and abase him that is high.</verse>
  <verse number="27">I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it: and it shall be no more, until he come whose right it is; and I will give it him.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And you, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus said the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites, and concerning their reproach; even say you, The sword, the sword is drawn: for the slaughter it is furbished, to consume because of the glittering:</verse>
  <verse number="29">Whiles they see vanity to you, whiles they divine a lie to you, to bring you on the necks of them that are slain, of the wicked, whose day is come, when their iniquity shall have an end.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge you in the place where you were created, in the land of your nativity.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And I will pour out my indignation on you, I will blow against you in the fire of my wrath, and deliver you into the hand of brutish men, and skillful to destroy.</verse>
  <verse number="32">You shall be for fuel to the fire; your blood shall be in the middle of the land; you shall be no more remembered: for I the LORD have spoken it.</verse>
