  <verse number="1">There were present at that season some that told him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Jesus answering said to them, Suppose you that these Galilaeans were sinners above all the Galilaeans, because they suffered such things?</verse>
  <verse number="3">I tell you, No: but, except you repent, you shall all likewise perish.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Or those eighteen, on whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think you that they were sinners above all men that dwelled in Jerusalem?</verse>
  <verse number="5">I tell you, No: but, except you repent, you shall all likewise perish.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He spoke also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then said he to the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why encumbers it the ground?</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he answering said to him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it:</verse>
  <verse number="9">And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that you shall cut it down.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said to her, Woman, you are loosed from your infirmity.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said to the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The Lord then answered him, and said, You hypocrite, does not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering?</verse>
  <verse number="16">And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, see, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?</verse>
  <verse number="17">And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Then said he, To what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it?</verse>
  <verse number="19">It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God?</verse>
  <verse number="21">It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Then said one to him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said to them,</verse>
  <verse number="24">Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say to you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</verse>
  <verse number="25">When once the master of the house is risen up, and has shut to the door, and you begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us; and he shall answer and say to you, I know you not from where you are:</verse>
  <verse number="26">Then shall you begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in your presence, and you have taught in our streets.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not from where you are; depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="28">There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.</verse>
  <verse number="31">The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying to him, Get you out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill you.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And he said to them, Go you, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="34">O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which kill the prophets, and stone them that are sent to you; how often would I have gathered your children together, as a hen does gather her brood under her wings, and you would not!</verse>
  <verse number="35">Behold, your house is left to you desolate: and truly I say to you, You shall not see me, until the time come when you shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.</verse>
