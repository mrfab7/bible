<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my chosen, in whom my soul delighteth: I have put my spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment in truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth; and the isles shall wait for his law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them forth; he that spread abroad the earth and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">to open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I am the LORD; that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise unto graven images.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth; ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein, the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit; let the inhabitants of Sela sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man; he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, he shall shout aloud; he shall do mightily against his enemies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will I cry out like a travailing woman; I will gasp and pant together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and will dry up the pools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And I will bring the blind by a way that they know not; in paths that they know not will I lead them: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked places straight. These things will I do, and I will not forsake them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say unto molten images, Ye are our gods.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I send? who is blind as he that is at peace with me, and blind as the LORD’S servant?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Thou seest many things, but thou observest not; his ears are open, but he heareth not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">It pleased the LORD, for his righteousness’ sake, to magnify the law, and make it honourable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Who is there among you that will give ear to this? that will hearken and hear for the time to come?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD? he against whom we have sinned, and in whose ways they would not walk, neither were they obedient unto his law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Therefore he poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.</p>
