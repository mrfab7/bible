1	The word of Jehovah which was to Jeremiah the prophet, against the rovers, before Pharaoh will smite Gaza.
2	Thus said Jehovah, Behold, waters coming up from the north, and they were for an overflowing torrent, and they shall overflow the land, and its fulness; the city and those dwelling in it: and the men cried out, and all inhabiting the land wailed.
3	From the voice of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones, from the bounding of his chariot, the noise of his wheels, the fathers turned not back to the sons from slackness of hands;
4	For the day came to lay waste all the rovers, to cut off from Tyre and Zidon every one left of help: for Jehovah laid waste the rovers, the remnant of the island of Caphtor.
5	Baldness came upon Gaza; Ashkelon was destroyed, the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?
6	Alas, thou sword of Jehovah, till when wilt thou rest? be gathered to thy sheath; be quiet and be still.
7	How shalt thou rest, and Jehovah commanded to it against Ashkelon, and against the sea-shore? there he confirmed it.
