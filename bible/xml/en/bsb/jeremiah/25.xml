<chapter book="Jeremiah" number="25" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">This is the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.</verse>
  <verse number="2">So the prophet Jeremiah spoke to all the people of Judah and all the residents of Jerusalem as follows:</verse>
  <verse number="3">“From the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon king of Judah until this very day—twenty-three years—the word of the LORD has come to me, and I have spoken to you again and again, but you have not listened.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the LORD has sent all His servants the prophets to you again and again, but you have not listened or inclined your ear to hear.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The prophets told you, ‘Turn now, each of you, from your evil ways and deeds, and you can dwell in the land that the LORD has given to you and your fathers forever and ever.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Do not follow other gods to serve and worship them, and do not provoke Me to anger with the works of your hands. Then I will do you no harm.’</verse>
  <verse number="7">‘But to your own harm, you have not listened to Me,’ declares the LORD, ‘so you have provoked Me to anger with the works of your hands.’</verse>
  <verse number="8">Therefore this is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘Because you have not obeyed My words,</verse>
  <verse number="9">behold, I will summon all the families of the north, declares the LORD, and I will send for My servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, whom I will bring against this land, against its residents, and against all the surrounding nations. So I will devote them to destruction and make them an object of horror and contempt, an everlasting desolation.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Moreover, I will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness, the voices of the bride and bridegroom, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And this whole land will become a desolate wasteland, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But when seventy years are complete, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their guilt, declares the LORD, and I will make it an everlasting desolation.</verse>
  <verse number="13">I will bring upon that land all the words I have pronounced against it, all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah has prophesied against all the nations.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For many nations and great kings will enslave them, and I will repay them according to their deeds and according to the work of their hands.’”</verse>
  <verse number="15">This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, said to me: “Take from My hand this cup of the wine of wrath, and make all the nations to whom I send you drink from it.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they will drink and stagger and go out of their minds, because of the sword that I will send among them.”</verse>
  <verse number="17">So I took the cup from the LORD’s hand and made all the nations drink from it, each one to whom the LORD had sent me,</verse>
  <verse number="18">to make them a ruin, an object of horror and contempt and cursing, as they are to this day—Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, its kings and officials;</verse>
  <verse number="19">Pharaoh king of Egypt, his officials, his leaders, and all his people;</verse>
  <verse number="20">all the mixed tribes; all the kings of Uz; all the kings of the Philistines: Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;</verse>
  <verse number="21">Edom, Moab, and the Ammonites;</verse>
  <verse number="22">all the kings of Tyre and Sidon; the kings of the coastlands across the sea;</verse>
  <verse number="23">Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all who cut the corners of their hair;</verse>
  <verse number="24">all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the mixed tribes who dwell in the desert;</verse>
  <verse number="25">all the kings of Zimri, Elam, and Media;</verse>
  <verse number="26">all the kings of the north, both near and far, one after another—all the kingdoms on the face of the earth. And after all of them, the king of Sheshach will drink it too.</verse>
  <verse number="27">“Then you are to tell them that this is what the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel, says: ‘Drink, get drunk, and vomit. Fall down and never get up again, because of the sword I will send among you.’</verse>
  <verse number="28">If they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink it, you are to tell them that this is what the LORD of Hosts says: ‘You most certainly must drink it!</verse>
  <verse number="29">For behold, I am beginning to bring disaster on the city that bears My Name, so how could you possibly go unpunished? You will not go unpunished, for I am calling down a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, declares the LORD of Hosts.’</verse>
  <verse number="30">So you are to prophesy all these words against them and say to them: ‘The LORD will roar from on high; He will raise His voice from His holy habitation. He will roar loudly over His pasture; like those who tread the grapes, He will call out with a shout against all the inhabitants of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="31">The tumult will resound to the ends of the earth because the LORD brings a charge against the nations. He brings judgment on all mankind and puts the wicked to the sword,’” declares the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="32">This is what the LORD of Hosts says: “Behold! Disaster is spreading from nation to nation; a mighty storm is rising from the ends of the earth.”</verse>
  <verse number="33">Those slain by the LORD on that day will be spread from one end of the earth to the other. They will not be mourned, gathered, or buried. They will be like dung lying on the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Wail, you shepherds, and cry out; roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock. For the days of your slaughter have come; you will fall and be shattered like fine pottery.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Flight will evade the shepherds, and escape will elude the leaders of the flock.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Hear the cry of the shepherds, the wailing of the leaders of the flock, for the LORD is destroying their pasture.</verse>
  <verse number="37">The peaceful meadows have been silenced because of the LORD’s burning anger.</verse>
  <verse number="38">He has left His den like a lion, for their land has been made a desolation by the sword of the oppressor, and because of the fierce anger of the LORD.</verse>
