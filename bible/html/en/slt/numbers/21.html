<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the Canaanite, King Arad, dwelling to the south, will hear that Israel came the way of the places, and he will fight against Israel, and he will carry off from him a captivity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Israel will vow a vow to Jehovah, and will say, If giving, thou wilt give this people into my hand, and I exterminated their cities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Jehovah will hear to the voice of Israel, and he will give the Canaanite, and he will exterminate them and their cities: and he will call the name of the place Hormah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they will remove from mount Hor, the way of the sea of sedge, to encompass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people will be shortened in the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the people will speak against God, and against Moses, For what brought ye us up from Egypt to die in the desert? for no bread, and no water; and our soul loathed upon this light bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Jehovah will send upon the people deadly serpents, and they will bite the people; and much people will die from Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the people will come to Moses, and they will say, We sinned, for we spake against Jehovah and against thee; wilt thou pray to Jehovah and he will remove the serpent from us? And Moses will pray for the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Jehovah will say to Moses, Make to thee a burning, and put it up for a signal: and it was every one being bitten, and he saw it and lived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Moses will make a brass serpent, and will set it up for a signal, and it was if the serpent bit a man and he looked upon the brass serpent, and he lived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the sons of Israel will remove, and will encamp in Oboth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And they will remove from Oboth and will encamp in Ije-Abarim, in the desert which is upon the face of Moab, from the rising of the sun.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">From thence they removed, and they will encamp in the valley of Zared.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">From thence they removed, and they will encamp from the other side of Amon, which is in the desert coming forth from the boundary of the Amorites: for Arnon is the boundary of Moab, between Moab and between the Amorites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For this it will be said in the book of the wars of Jehovah, Giving in the whirlwind, and the torrents of Arnon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the outpouring of the torrents which extended to the rest at Ar, and reclined to the boundary of Moab.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And from thence the well; it is the well of which Jehovah said to Moses, Gather the people together and I will give to them water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The Israel will sing this song: Ascend thou well! answer ye to it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The leaders dug it, the nobles of the people dug it, by cutting in by their props. And from the desert to Mattanah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And from Mattanah to the Valley of God; and from the Valley of God to Bamoth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And from Bamoth, the valley which is in the field of Moab, the head of Pisgah, and looking upon the face of Jeshimon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Israel will send messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">I will pass over in thy land: we will not turn into the field and into the vineyard; we will not drink water of the well; in the way of the king we will go till we shall pass over thy boundary.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Sihon gave not to Israel to pass over by his boundary; and Sihon will gather all his people, and will come forth to meet Israel to the desert: and he will come to Jahaz, and he will fight against Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Israel will smite him with the mouth of the sword, and he will possess his land from Arnon to Jabbok, even to the sons of Ammon: for the boundary of the sons of Ammon was strong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Israel will take all these cities: and Israel will dwell in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all her daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For Heshbon this the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites; and he fought against the king of Moab, and he will take all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For this they will say, using parables, Come ye to Heshbon; the city of Sihon shall be built and prepared.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For a fire shall come forth from Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it consumed Ar of Moab, the lords of the heights of Arnon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Wo to thee, Moab! thou wert destroyed, O people of Chemosh: he gave his sons escaping, and his daughters, into captivity to the king of the Amorites, Sihon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And we shall shoot them; Heshbon was destroyed, even to Dibon, and the women even to Nophah, which is to Medeba.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And Israel will dwell in the land of the Amorites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And Moses will send to search Jazer, and they will take her daughters, and will drive out the Amorite who is there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And they will turn and go up the way of Bashan: and Og, king of Bashan, will come forth to their meeting, he and all his people, to the war at Edrei.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And Jehovah will say to Moses, Thou shalt not be afraid of him; for into thy hand I gave him, and all his people and his land; and do to him as thou didst to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who will dwell in Heshbon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And they will strike him, and his sons, and all his people, until a survivor was not left to him: and they will possess his land.</p>
