<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And a woman when she shall vow a vow to Jehovah, and bind a binding in the house of her father, in her youth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And her father heard her vow and her binding which she bound upon her soul, and her father was silent to her; and all her vows stood, and all the binding which she bound upon her soul shall stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And if her father refused her in the day of his hearing, all her vows and all her bindings which she bound upon her soul, it shall not stand; and Jehovah will forgive her, for her father refused her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And if being she shall be to a husband, and her vows upon her, or the babbling of her lips which she bound upon her soul:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And her husband heard in the day of his hearing, and was silent to her: and her vows stood, and the binding which she bound upon her soul shall stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And if in the day her husband heard he shall refuse her, and he annulled her vows which were upon her, and the babbling of her lips which she bound upon her soul, and Jehovah will forgive her.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And if her husband being silent, shall be silent to her from day to day; and he caused to stand all her vows, or, all her bindings which were upon her: he caused them to stand, for he was silent to her in the day of his hearing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And if annulling, he annulled them after his hearing; and he bore the iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">These the laws which Jehovah commanded Moses between a man to his wife, between a father to his daughter, in her youth in her fatherâ€™s house.</p>
