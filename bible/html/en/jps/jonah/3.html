<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and make unto it the proclamation that I bid thee.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city, of three days’ journey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he proclaimed, and said: ‘Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the people of Nineveh believed God; and they proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the tidings reached the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying: ‘Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing; let them not feed, nor drink water;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">but let them be covered with sackcloth, both man and beast, and let them cry mightily unto God; yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who knoweth whether God will not turn and repent, and turn away from His fierce anger, that we perish not?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, which He said He would do unto them; and He did it not.</p>
