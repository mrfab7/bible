<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And on the third day a marriage took place in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Jesus also, and his disciples, were invited to the marriage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And wine being deficient, the mother of Jesus says to him, They have no wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Jesus says to her, What have I to do with thee, woman? mine hour has not yet come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">His mother says to the servants, Whatever he may say to you, do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Now there were standing there six stone water-vessels, according to the purification of the Jews, holding two or three measures each.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Jesus says to them, Fill the water-vessels with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he says to them, Draw out now, and carry [it] to the feast-master. And they carried [it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But when the feast-master had tasted the water which had been made wine (and knew not whence it was, but the servants knew who drew the water), the feast-master calls the bridegroom,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and says to him, Every man sets on first the good wine, and when [men] have well drunk, then the inferior; thou hast kept the good wine till now.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">This beginning of signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">After this he descended to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples; and there they abode not many days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he found in the temple the sellers of oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and, having made a scourge of cords, he cast [them] all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the change of the money-changers, and overturned the tables,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">and said to the sellers of doves, Take these things hence; make not my Fatherâ€™s house a house of merchandise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">[And] his disciples remembered that it is written, The zeal of thy house devours me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The Jews therefore answered and said to him, What sign shewest thou to us, that thou doest these things?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple building, and thou wilt raise it up in three days?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But he spoke of the temple of his body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">When therefore he was raised from among [the] dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And when he was in Jerusalem, at the passover, at the feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he wrought.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them, because he knew all [men],</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">and that he had not need that any should testify of man, for himself knew what was in man.</p>
