<div class="chapter" data-book="James" data-chapter="2" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, of glory, with distinction of faces.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For if there come into your synagogue a man wearing gold rings on is fingers, in brilliant clothing, and there come in also a beggar in filthy clothing;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And ye look toward him bearing the brilliant clothing, and ye say to him, Sit thou well here; and to the beggar ye say, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Were ye not separated among yourselves, and become judges of evil reflections?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Hear, my dearly beloved brethren, Has not God chosen the beggars of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them loving him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And ye have despised the beggar. Do not the rich bring you into subjection, and draw you before tribunals?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And do they not defame the good name called upon you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">If yet ye complete the royal law according to the writing, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And if ye make distinction of faces, ye work sin, being convicted under the law as transgressors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For whoever shall keep the whole law, and stumble in one, has become bound of all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For he having said, Thou shouldest not commit adultery, said also, Thou shouldest not kill: and if thou commit not adultery, and dost kill, thou hast become a transgressor of the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">So speak ye, and so do, as about to be judged by the law of liberty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For unpropitiated judgment to him not doing mercy; and mercy boasteth against judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And what profit, my brethren, if any say he has faith, and should not have works? can faith save him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And if a brother or sister be naked, and be failing of daily food,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And any of you say to them, Retire in peace, be ye warmed and be ye fed; and ye give them not things fitting the body; what profit?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">So also faith, if it have not works, is dead by itself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But certain will say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith from my works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: and the evil spirits believe, and shudder.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And wilt thou know, O empty man, that faith without works is dead?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Was not Abraham our father justified by works, having brought up Isaac his son upon the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Thou seest that faith cooperated with his works, and from works was faith perfected.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And the writing was completed, saying, And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for justice: and he was called the Friend of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Therefore ye see that man is justified from works, and not from faith alone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And likewise also was not Rehab the harlot justified by works, having received the messengers, and cast out by another way?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.</p>
