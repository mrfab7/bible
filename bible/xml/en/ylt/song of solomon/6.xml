<chapter book="Song of Solomon" number="6" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Whither hath thy beloved gone, O fair among women? Whither hath thy beloved turned, And we seek him with thee?</verse>
  <verse number="2">My beloved went down to his garden, To the beds of the spice, To delight himself in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine, Who is delighting himself among the lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Fair art thou, my friend, as Tirzah, Comely as Jerusalem, Awe-inspiring as bannered hosts.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Turn round thine eyes from before me, Because they have made me proud. Thy hair is as a row of the goats, That have shone from Gilead,</verse>
  <verse number="6">Thy teeth as a row of the lambs, That have come up from the washing, Because all of them are forming twins, And a bereaved one is not among them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">As the work of the pomegranate is thy temple behind thy veil.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Sixty are queens, and eighty concubines, And virgins without number.</verse>
  <verse number="9">One is my dove, my perfect one, One she is of her mother, The choice one she is of her that bare her, Daughters saw, and pronounce her happy, Queens and concubines, and they praise her.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Who is this that is looking forth as morning, Fair as the moon—clear as the sun, Awe-inspiring as bannered hosts?’</verse>
  <verse number="11">Unto a garden of nuts I went down, To look on the buds of the valley, To see whither the vine had flourished, The pomegranates had blossomed—</verse>
  <verse number="12">I knew not my soul, It made me—chariots of my people Nadib.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Return, return, O Shulammith! Return, return, and we look upon thee. What do ye see in Shulammith?</verse>
