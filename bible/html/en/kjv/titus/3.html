<div class="chapter" data-book="Titus" data-chapter="3" data-translation="King James Bible" data-translation-id="kjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, [but] gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, [and] hating one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">[This is] a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace [be] with you all. Amen.</p>
