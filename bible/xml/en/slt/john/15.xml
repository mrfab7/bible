<chapter book="John" number="15" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Every branch in me not bearing fruit he takes away: and every one bearing fruit, he cleanses it, that it might bear more fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Already are ye clean, through the word which I have spoken to you.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Remain in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, if it remain not in the vine; so neither ye, if ye remain not in me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I am the vine, ye the branches: he remaining in me, and I in him, he bears much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="6">If any remain not in me, he was cast forth as the branch, and was dried up; and they gather them together, and cast into the fire, and they are burned.</verse>
  <verse number="7">If ye remain in me, and my words remain in you, ye shall ask whatever ye wish, and it shall be to you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">In this was my Father honoured, that ye should bear much fruit: and ye shall be disciples to me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">As the Father loved me, I also loved you: remain in my love.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If ye keep my commands, ye shall remain in my love; as I have kept my Father’s commands, and remain in his love.</verse>
  <verse number="11">These things have I spoken to you, that my joy might remain in you, and your joy might be completed.</verse>
  <verse number="12">This is my command, That ye love one another, as I loved you.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Greater love than this has none, that any lay down his life for his friends.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Ye are my friends, if ye do whatever I command you.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I no more call you servants; for the servant knows not what his lord does: and I have called you friends; for all which I heard of my Father I made known to you.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Ye chose not me, but I chose you, and I have set you, that ye might retire and bear fruit, and your fruit remain: that whatever ye ask the Father in my name, he might give you.</verse>
  <verse number="17">These things I command you, that ye love one another.</verse>
  <verse number="18">If the world hate you, know that it has hated me the first of you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">If ye were of the world, the world had loved its own: and because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Remember the word which I said to you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they expelled me, they will also expel you; if they kept my word, they will keep yours also.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But all these will they do to you for my name, for they know not him having sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not sin and now they have no pretext for their sin.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He hating me hates my Father also.</verse>
  <verse number="24">If I did not the works in them which none other has done, they had not sin: and now have they also seen and hated also me and my Father.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But that the word written in their law might be completed, That they hated me gratuitously.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And when the Intercessor should come, which I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, which comes from the Father, he shall testify of me:</verse>
  <verse number="27">And ye also testify, for ye are with me from the beginning.</verse>
