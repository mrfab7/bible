<chapter book="Revelation" number="17" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven vials, and talked with me, saying to me, Come here; I will show to you the judgment of the great whore that sits on many waters:</verse>
  <verse number="2">With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.</verse>
  <verse number="3">So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit on a scarlet colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornication:</verse>
  <verse number="5">And on her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the angel said to me, Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The beast that you saw was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And here is the mind which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and is of the seven, and goes into perdition.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one hour with the beast.</verse>
  <verse number="13">These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength to the beast.</verse>
  <verse number="14">These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he said to me, The waters which you saw, where the whore sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the ten horns which you saw on the beast, these shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For God has put in their hearts to fulfill his will, and to agree, and give their kingdom to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the woman which you saw is that great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth.</verse>
