<p class="verse" data-verse="1">If therefore ye have been raised with the Christ, seek the things [which are] above, where the Christ is, sitting at [the] right hand of God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">have your mind on the things [that are] above, not on the things [that are] on the earth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">for ye have died, and your life is hid with the Christ in God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">When the Christ is manifested who [is] our life, then shall ye also be manifested with him in glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Put to death therefore your members which [are] upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, vile passions, evil lust, and unbridled desire, which is idolatry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">On account of which things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In which ye also once walked when ye lived in these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But now, put off, ye also, all [these] things, wrath, anger, malice, blasphemy, vile language out of your mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Do not lie to one another, having put off the old man with his deeds,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and having put on the new, renewed into full knowledge according to [the] image of him that has created him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">wherein there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondman, freeman; but Christ [is] everything, and in all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Put on therefore, as [the] elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, longsuffering;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any should have a complaint against any; even as the Christ has forgiven you, so also [do] ye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And to all these [add] love, which is the bond of perfectness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And let the peace of Christ preside in your hearts, to which also ye have been called in one body, and be thankful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let the word of the Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another, in psalms, hymns, spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And everything, whatever ye may do in word or in deed, [do] all things in [the] name of [the] Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father by him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Wives, be subject to [your] husbands, as is fitting in [the] Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in [the] Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Fathers, do not vex your children, to the end that they be not disheartened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Bondmen, obey in all things your masters according to flesh; not with eye-services, as men-pleasers, but in simplicity of heart, fearing the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Whatsoever ye do, labour at it heartily, as [doing it] to the Lord, and not to men;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">knowing that of [the] Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance; ye serve the Lord Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For he that does a wrong shall receive the wrong he has done, and there is no respect of persons.</p>
