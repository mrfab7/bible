<div class="chapter" data-book="Hosea" data-chapter="6" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Go ye and we will turn back to Jehovah: for he rent and he will heal us; he will strike, and he will bind us up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">He will revive us after two days: in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And we shall know, we shall pursue to know Jehovah: as the morning his going forth was prepared; and he shall come as the rain to us, as the latter rain, the early rain of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">What shall I do to thee, O Ephraim? What shall I do to thee, O Judah? and your kindness as the cloud of the morning, and as the dew being early went away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For this I cut off by the prophets; I slew them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments the light going forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For I delighted in mercy and not sacrifice; the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And they as man passed by the covenant: there they acted faithlessly against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Gilead a city working vanity, defrauding from blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">As troops waiting for a man, the company of priests will break in pieces the way with the shoulder: for they did wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">In the house of Israel I saw something horrible: there the fornications to Ephraim, Israel was defiled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Also, O Judah, he set a harvest for thee in my turning back the captivity of my people.</p>
