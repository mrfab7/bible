<chapter book="Ephesians" number="6" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Children, obey your parents in [the] Lord, for this is just.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first commandment with a promise,</verse>
  <verse number="3">that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest be long-lived on the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And [ye] fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in [the] discipline and admonition of [the] Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Bondmen, obey masters according to flesh, with fear and trembling, in simplicity of your heart as to the Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="6">not with eye-service as men-pleasers; but as bondmen of Christ, doing the will of God from [the] soul,</verse>
  <verse number="7">serving with good will as to the Lord, and not to men;</verse>
  <verse number="8">knowing that whatever good each shall do, this he shall receive of [the] Lord, whether bond or free.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And, masters, do the same things towards them, giving up threatening, knowing that both their and your Master is in heaven, and there is no acceptance of persons with him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For the rest, brethren, be strong in [the] Lord, and in the might of his strength.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Put on the panoply of God, that ye may be able to stand against the artifices of the devil:</verse>
  <verse number="12">because our struggle is not against blood and flesh, but against principalities, against authorities, against the universal lords of this darkness, against spiritual [power] of wickedness in the heavenlies.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For this reason take [to you] the panoply of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and, having accomplished all things, to stand.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Stand therefore, having girt about your loins with truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,</verse>
  <verse number="15">and shod your feet with [the] preparation of the glad tidings of peace:</verse>
  <verse number="16">besides all [these], having taken the shield of faith with which ye will be able to quench all the inflamed darts of the wicked one.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Have also the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is God’s word;</verse>
  <verse number="18">praying at all seasons, with all prayer and supplication in [the] Spirit, and watching unto this very thing with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints;</verse>
  <verse number="19">and for me in order that utterance may be given to me in [the] opening of my mouth to make known with boldness the mystery of the glad tidings,</verse>
  <verse number="20">for which I am an ambassador [bound] with a chain, that I may be bold in it as I ought to speak.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But in order that ye also may know what concerns me, how I am getting on, Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister in [the] Lord, shall make all things known to you;</verse>
  <verse number="22">whom I have sent to you for this very thing, that ye may know of our affairs and that he may encourage your hearts.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Peace to the brethren, and love with faith, from God [the] Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Grace with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption.</verse>
