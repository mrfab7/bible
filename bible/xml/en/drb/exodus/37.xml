  <verse number="1">And Beseleel made also the ark of setim wood: it was two cubits and a half in length, and a cubit and a half in breadth, and the height was of one cubit and a half: and he overlaid it with the purest gold within and without.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he made to it a crown of gold round about,</verse>
  <verse number="3">Casting four rings of gold at the four corners thereof: two rings in one side, and two in the other.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he made bars of setim wood, which he overlaid with gold,</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he put them into the rings that were at the sides of the ark to carry it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He made also the propitiatory, that is, the oracle, of the purest gold, two cubits and a half in length, and a cubit and a half in breadth.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Two cherubims also of beaten gold, which he set on the two sides of the propitiatory:</verse>
  <verse number="8">One cherub in the top of one side, and the other cherub in the top of the other side: two cherubims at the two ends of the propitiatory,</verse>
  <verse number="9">Spreading their wings, and covering the propitiatory, and looking one towards the other, and towards it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He made also the table of setim wood, in length two cubits, and in breadth one cubit, and in height it was a cubit and a half.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he overlaid it with the finest gold, and he made to it a golden ledge round about.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And to the ledge itself he made a polished crown of gold, of four fingers’ breadth, and upon the same another golden crown.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he cast four rings of gold, which he put in the four corners at each foot of the table,</verse>
  <verse number="14">Over against the crown: and he put the bars into them, that the table might be carried.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the bars also themselves he made of setim wood, and overlaid them with gold,</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the vessels for the divers uses of the table, dishes, bowls, and cups, and censers of pure gold, wherein the libations are to be offered.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He made also the candlestick of beaten work of the finest gold. From the shaft whereof its branches, its cups, and bowls, and lilies came out:</verse>
  <verse number="18">Six on the two sides: three branches on one side, and three on the other.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Three cups in manner of a nut on each branch, and bowls withal and lilies; and three cups of the fashion of a nut in another branch, and bowls withal and lilies. The work of the six branches that went out from the shaft of the candlestick was equal.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And in the shaft itself were four cups after the manner of a nut, and bowls withal at every one, and lilies:</verse>
  <verse number="21">And bowls under two branches in three places, which together make six branches going out from one shaft.</verse>
  <verse number="22">So both the bowls, and the branches were of the same, all beaten work of the purest gold.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He made also the seven lamps with their snuffers, and the vessels where the snuffings were to be put out, of the purest gold.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The candlestick with all the vessels thereof weighed a talent of gold.</verse>
  <verse number="25">He made also the altar of incense of setim wood, being a cubit on every side foursquare, and in height two cubits: from the corners of which went out horns.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And he overlaid it with the purest gold, with its grate and the sides, and the horns.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he made to it a crown of gold round about, and two golden rings under the crown at each side, that the bars might be put into them, and the altar be carried.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the bars themselves he made also of setim wood, and overlaid them with plates of gold.</verse>
  <verse number="29">He compounded also the oil for the ointment of sanctification, and incense of the purest spices, according to the work of a perfumer.</verse>
