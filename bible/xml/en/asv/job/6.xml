<chapter book="Job" number="6" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Then Job answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Oh that my vexation were but weighed, And all my calamity laid in the balances!</verse>
  <verse number="3">For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas: Therefore have my words been rash.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, The poison whereof my spirit drinketh up: The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? Or loweth the ox over his fodder?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Can that which hath no savor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</verse>
  <verse number="7">My soul refuseth to touch them; They are as loathsome food to me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Oh that I might have my request; And that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</verse>
  <verse number="9">Even that it would please God to crush me; That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</verse>
  <verse number="10">And be it still my consolation, Yea, let me exult in pain that spareth not, That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</verse>
  <verse number="11">What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is mine end, that I should be patient?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of brass?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Is it not that I have no help in me, And that wisdom is driven quite from me?</verse>
  <verse number="14">To him that is ready to faint kindness should be showed from his friend; Even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
  <verse number="15">My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, As the channel of brooks that pass away;</verse>
  <verse number="16">Which are black by reason of the ice, And wherein the snow hideth itself:</verse>
  <verse number="17">What time they wax warm, they vanish; When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The caravans that travel by the way of them turn aside; They go up into the waste, and perish.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The caravans of Tema looked, The companies of Sheba waited for them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">They were put to shame because they had hoped; They came thither, and were confounded.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For now ye are nothing; Ye see a terror, and are afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Did I say, Give unto me? Or, Offer a present for me of your substance?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Or, Deliver me from the adversary’s hand? Or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Teach me, and I will hold my peace; And cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</verse>
  <verse number="25">How forcible are words of uprightness! But your reproof, what doth it reprove?</verse>
  <verse number="26">Do ye think to reprove words, Seeing that the speeches of one that is desperate are as wind?</verse>
  <verse number="27">Yea, ye would cast lots upon the fatherless, And make merchandise of your friend.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Now therefore be pleased to look upon me; For surely I shall not lie to your face.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice; Yea, return again, my cause is righteous.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern mischievous things?</verse>
