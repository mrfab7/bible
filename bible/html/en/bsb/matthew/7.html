<div class="chapter" data-book="Matthew" data-chapter="7" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“Do not judge, or you will be judged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For with the same judgment you pronounce, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye but fail to notice the beam in your own eye?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ while there is still a beam in your own eye?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">You hypocrite! First take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Do not give dogs what is holy; do not throw your pearls before swine. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and then turn and tear you to pieces.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">In everything, then, do to others as you would have them do to you. For this is the essence of the Law and the Prophets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many enter through it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But small is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life, and only a few find it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Beware of false prophets. They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">By their fruit you will recognize them. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">So then, by their fruit you will recognize them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of My Father in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Many will say to Me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you; depart from Me, you workers of lawlessness!’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The rain fell, the torrents raged, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because its foundation was on the rock.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The rain fell, the torrents raged, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell—and great was its collapse!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were astonished at His teaching,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">because He taught as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.</p>
