<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="8" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now concerning things sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</verse>
  <verse number="2">But if anyone thinks that he knows anything, he doesn’t yet know as he ought to know.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But if anyone loves God, the same is known by him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Therefore concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that no idol is anything in the world, and that there is no other God but one.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For though there are things that are called “gods,” whether in the heavens or on earth; as there are many “gods” and many “lords;”</verse>
  <verse number="6">yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we live through him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">However, that knowledge isn’t in all men. But some, with consciousness of the idol until now, eat as of a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But food will not commend us to God. For neither, if we don’t eat, are we the worse; nor, if we eat, are we the better.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But be careful that by no means does this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For if a man sees you who have knowledge sitting in an idol’s temple, won’t his conscience, if he is weak, be emboldened to eat things sacrificed to idols?</verse>
  <verse number="11">And through your knowledge, he who is weak perishes, the brother for whose sake Christ died.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Thus, sinning against the brothers, and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will eat no meat forevermore, that I don’t cause my brother to stumble.</verse>
