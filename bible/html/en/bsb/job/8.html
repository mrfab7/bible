<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“How long will you go on saying such things? The words of your mouth are a blustering wind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what is right?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">When your children sinned against Him, He gave them over to their rebellion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But if you would earnestly seek God and ask the Almighty for mercy,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">if you are pure and upright, even now He will rouse Himself on your behalf and restore your righteous estate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Though your beginnings were modest, your latter days will flourish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Please inquire of past generations and consider the discoveries of their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For we were born yesterday and know nothing; our days on earth are but a shadow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Will they not teach you and tell you, and speak from their understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Does papyrus grow where there is no marsh? Do reeds flourish without water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">While the shoots are still uncut, they dry up more quickly than grass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Such is the destiny of all who forget God; so the hope of the godless will perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">His confidence is fragile; his security is in a spider’s web.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He leans on his web, but it gives way; he holds fast, but it does not endure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He is a well-watered plant in the sunshine, spreading its shoots over the garden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">His roots wrap around the rock heap; he looks for a home among the stones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If he is uprooted from his place, it will disown him, saying, ‘I never saw you.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Surely this is the joy of his way; yet others will spring from the dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Behold, God does not reject the blameless, nor will He strengthen the hand of evildoers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with a shout of joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Your enemies will be clothed in shame, and the tent of the wicked will be no more.”</p>
