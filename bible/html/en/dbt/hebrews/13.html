<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Let brotherly love abide.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Be not forgetful of hospitality; for by it some have unawares entertained angels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Remember prisoners, as bound with [them]; those that are evil-treated, as being yourselves also in [the] body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">[Let] marriage [be held] every way in honour, and the bed [be] undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers will God judge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">[Let your] conversation [be] without love of money, satisfied with [your] present circumstances; for he has said, I will not leave thee, neither will I forsake thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">So that, taking courage, we may say, The Lord [is] my helper, and I will not be afraid: what will man do unto me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Remember your leaders who have spoken to you the word of God; and considering the issue of their conversation, imitate their faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Jesus Christ [is] the same yesterday, and to-day, and to the ages [to come].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Be not carried away with various and strange doctrines; for [it is] good that the heart be confirmed with grace, not meats; those who have walked in which have not been profited by [them].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">We have an altar of which they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">for of those beasts whose blood is carried [as sacrifices for sin] into the [holy of] holies by the high priest, of these the bodies are burned outside the camp.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Wherefore also Jesus, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">therefore let us go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">for we have not here an abiding city, but we seek the coming one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">By him therefore let us offer [the] sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, [the] fruit of [the] lips confessing his name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But of doing good and communicating [of your substance] be not forgetful, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Obey your leaders, and be submissive; for they watch over your souls as those that shall give account; that they may do this with joy, and not groaning, for this [would be] unprofitable for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Pray for us: for we persuade ourselves that we have a good conscience, in all things desirous to walk rightly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But I much more beseech [you] to do this, that I may the more quickly be restored to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But the God of peace, who brought again from among [the] dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, in [the power of the] blood of [the] eternal covenant,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">perfect you in every good work to the doing of his will, doing in you what is pleasing before him through Jesus Christ; to whom [be] glory for the ages of ages. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But I beseech you, brethren, bear the word of exhortation, for it is but in few words that I have written to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Know that our brother Timotheus is set at liberty; with whom, if he should come soon, I will see you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Salute all your leaders, and all the saints. They from Italy salute you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Grace [be] with you all. Amen.</p>
