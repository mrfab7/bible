<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The wicked flee when no man pursueth; But the righteous are secure as a young lion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof; But by a man of understanding and knowledge established order shall long continue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A poor man that oppresseth the weak Is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They that forsake the law praise the wicked; But such as keep the law contend with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Evil men understand not justice; But they that seek the LORD understand all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, Than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">A wise son observeth the teaching; but he that is a companion of gluttonous men shameth his father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that augmenteth his substance by interest and increase, Gathereth it for him that is gracious to the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer is an abomination.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Whoso causeth the upright to go astray in an evil way, He shall fall himself into his own pit; But the whole-hearted shall inherit good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The rich man is wise in his own eyes; But the poor that hath understanding searcheth him through.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When the righteous exult, there is great glory; But when the wicked rise, men must be sought for.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He that covereth his transgressions shall not prosper; But whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall obtain mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Happy is the man that feareth alway; But he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">As a roaring lion, and a ravenous bear; So is a wicked ruler over a poor people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The prince that lacketh understanding is also a great oppressor; But he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A man that is laden with the blood of any person Shall hasten his steps unto the pit; none will support him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved; But he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He that tilleth his ground shall have plenty of bread; But he that followeth after vain things shall have poverty enough.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A faithful man shall abound with blessings; But he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be unpunished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">To have respect of persons is not good; For a man will transgress for a piece of bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He that hath an evil eye hasteneth after riches, And knoweth not that want shall come upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He that rebuketh a man shall in the end find more favour Than he that flattereth with the tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith: ‘It is no transgression’, The same is the companion of a destroyer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He that is of a greedy spirit stirreth up strife; But he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be abundantly gratified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool; But whoso walketh wisely, he shall escape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack; But he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; But when they perish, the righteous increase.</p>
