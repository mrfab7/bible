  <verse number="13">And he shall take a wife in her virginity.</verse>

  <verse number="19">Or a man to whom there shall be in him a broken foot or a broken hand,</verse>
  <verse number="20">Or curved, or withered, or stained in his eye, or scurvy, or scabby, or a bruised testicle:</verse>

  <verse number="22">The bread of his God the holy of holies, and from the holies shall he eat.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But he shall not come in to the vail, and to the altar he shall not come near, for a blemish is in him; and he shall not profane my holy place: for I Jehovah consecrating them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Moses will speak to Aaron and to his sons and to all the sons of Israel.</verse>
