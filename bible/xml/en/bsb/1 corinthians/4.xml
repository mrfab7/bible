<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="4" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">So then, men ought to regard us as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Now it is required of stewards that they be found faithful.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I care very little, however, if I am judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself.</verse>
  <verse number="4">My conscience is clear, but that does not vindicate me. It is the Lord who judges me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Therefore judge nothing before the appointed time; wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of men’s hearts. At that time each will receive his praise from God.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Brothers, I have applied these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, so that you may learn from us not to go beyond what is written. Then you will not take pride in one man over another.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For who makes you so superior? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Already you have all you want. Already you have become rich. Without us, you have become kings. How I wish you really were kings, so that we might be kings with you!</verse>
  <verse number="9">For it seems to me that God has displayed us apostles at the end of the procession, like prisoners appointed for death. We have become a spectacle to the whole world, to angels as well as to men.</verse>
  <verse number="10">We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we are dishonored.</verse>
  <verse number="11">To this very hour we are hungry and thirsty, we are poorly clothed, we are brutally treated, we are homeless.</verse>
  <verse number="12">We work hard with our own hands. When we are vilified, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it;</verse>
  <verse number="13">when we are slandered, we answer gently. Up to this moment we have become the scum of the earth, the refuse of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I am not writing this to shame you, but to warn you as my beloved children.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Even if you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore I urge you to imitate me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">That is why I have sent you Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of my way of life in Christ Jesus, which is exactly what I teach everywhere in every church.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Some of you have become arrogant, as if I were not coming to you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord is willing, and then I will find out not only what these arrogant people are saying, but what power they have.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Which do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and with a gentle spirit?</verse>
