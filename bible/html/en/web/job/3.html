<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed the day of his birth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Job answered:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">“Let the day perish in which I was born, the night which said, ‘There is a boy conceived.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Let that day be darkness. Don’t let God from above seek for it, neither let the light shine on it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own. Let a cloud dwell on it. Let all that makes black the day terrify it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">As for that night, let thick darkness seize on it. Let it not rejoice among the days of the year. Let it not come into the number of the months.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, let that night be barren. Let no joyful voice come therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Let them curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Let the stars of its twilight be dark. Let it look for light, but have none, neither let it see the eyelids of the morning,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">because it didn’t shut up the doors of my mother’s womb, nor did it hide trouble from my eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">“Why didn’t I die from the womb? Why didn’t I give up the spirit when my mother bore me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should nurse?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For now should I have lain down and been quiet. I should have slept, then I would have been at rest,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">with kings and counselors of the earth, who built up waste places for themselves;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, as infants who never saw light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">There the wicked cease from troubling. There the weary are at rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">There the prisoners are at ease together. They don’t hear the voice of the taskmaster.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The small and the great are there. The servant is free from his master.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">“Why is light given to him who is in misery, life to the bitter in soul,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Who long for death, but it doesn’t come; and dig for it more than for hidden treasures,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For my sighing comes before I eat. My groanings are poured out like water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For the thing which I fear comes on me, That which I am afraid of comes to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; but trouble comes.”</p>
