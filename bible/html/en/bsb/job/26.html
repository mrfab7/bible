<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“How you have helped the powerless and saved the arm that is feeble!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">How you have counseled the unwise and provided fully sound insight!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To whom have you uttered these words? And whose spirit spoke through you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The dead tremble—those beneath the waters and those who dwell in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He stretches out the north over empty space; He hangs the earth upon nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He wraps up the waters in His clouds, yet the clouds do not burst under their own weight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He covers the face of the full moon, spreading over it His cloud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He has inscribed a horizon on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The foundations of heaven quake, astounded at His rebuke.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">By His power He stirred the sea; by His understanding He shattered Rahab.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">By His breath the skies were cleared; His hand pierced the fleeing serpent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Indeed, these are but the fringes of His ways; how faint is the whisper we hear of Him! Who then can understand the thunder of His power?”</p>
