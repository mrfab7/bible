<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="12" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job answereth and saith:—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Truly—ye are the people, And with you doth wisdom die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I also have a heart like you, I am not fallen more than you, And with whom is there not like these?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A laughter to his friend I am: ‘He calleth to God, and He answereth him,’ A laughter is the perfect righteous one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A torch—despised in the thoughts of the secure Is prepared for those sliding with the feet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">At peace are the tents of spoilers, And those provoking God have confidence, He into whose hand God hath brought.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And yet, ask, I pray thee, One of the beasts, and it doth shew thee, And a fowl of the heavens, And it doth declare to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Or talk to the earth, and it sheweth thee, And fishes of the sea recount to thee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">‘Who hath not known in all these, That the hand of Jehovah hath done this?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">In whose hand is the breath of every living thing, And the spirit of all flesh of man.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Doth not the ear try words? And the palate taste food for itself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">With the very aged is wisdom, And with length of days understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">With Him are wisdom and might, To him are counsel and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Lo, He breaketh down, and it is not built up, He shutteth against a man, And it is not opened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Lo, He keepeth in the waters, and they are dried up, And he sendeth them forth, And they overturn the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">With Him are strength and wisdom, His the deceived and deceiver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Causing counsellors to go away a spoil, And judges He maketh foolish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The bands of kings He hath opened, And He bindeth a girdle on their loins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Causing ministers to go away a spoil And strong ones He overthroweth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Turning aside the lip of the stedfast, And the reason of the aged He taketh away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Pouring contempt upon princes, And the girdle of the mighty He made feeble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Removing deep things out of darkness, And He bringeth out to light death-shade.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Magnifying the nations, and He destroyeth them, Spreading out the nations, and He quieteth them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Turning aside the heart Of the heads of the people of the land, And he causeth them to wander In vacancy—no way!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">They feel darkness, and not light, He causeth them to wander as a drunkard.</p>
