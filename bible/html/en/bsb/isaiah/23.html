<p class="verse" data-verse="1">This is the burden against Tyre: Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is laid waste, without house or harbor. Word has reached them from the land of Cyprus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Be silent, O dwellers of the coastland, you merchants of Sidon, whose traders have crossed the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">On the great waters came the grain of Shihor; the harvest of the Nile was the revenue of Tyre; she was the merchant of the nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Be ashamed, O Sidon, the stronghold of the sea, for the sea has spoken: “I have not been in labor or given birth. I have not raised young men or brought up young women.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">When the report reaches Egypt, they will writhe in agony over the news of Tyre.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Cross over to Tarshish; wail, O inhabitants of the coastland!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Is this your jubilant city, whose origin is from antiquity, whose feet have taken her to settle far away?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Who planned this against Tyre, the bestower of crowns, whose traders are princes, whose merchants are renowned on the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The LORD of Hosts planned it, to defile all its glorious beauty, to disgrace all the renowned of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Cultivate your land like the Nile, O Daughter of Tarshish; there is no longer a harbor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The LORD has stretched out His hand over the sea; He has made kingdoms tremble. He has given a command that the strongholds of Canaan be destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He said, “You shall rejoice no more, O oppressed Virgin Daughter of Sidon. Get up and cross over to Cyprus—even there you will find no rest.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Look at the land of the Chaldeans—a people now of no account. The Assyrians destined it for the desert creatures; they set up their siege towers and stripped its palaces. They brought it to ruin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for your harbor has been destroyed!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">At that time Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years—the span of a king’s life. But at the end of seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the harlot:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">“Take up your harp, stroll through the city, O forgotten harlot. Make sweet melody, sing many a song, so you will be remembered.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And at the end of seventy years, the LORD will restore Tyre. Then she will return to hire as a prostitute and sell herself to all the kingdoms on the face of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Yet her profits and wages will be set apart to the LORD; they will not be stored or saved, for her profit will go to those who live before the LORD, for abundant food and fine clothing.</p>
