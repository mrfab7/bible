  <verse number="1">NOW concerning spiritual things, my brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</verse>
  <verse number="2">You know that when you were heathens, you went to dumb idols, according as you were led.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man, speaking by the Spirit of God, saith Anathema to Jesus. And no man can say the Lord Jesus, but by the Holy Ghost.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Now there are diversities of graces, but the same Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="5">And there are diversities of ministries, but the same Lord;</verse>
  <verse number="6">And there are diversities of operations, but the same God, who worketh all in all.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man unto profit.</verse>
  <verse number="8">To one indeed, by the Spirit, is given the word of wisdom: and to another, the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="9">To another, faith in the same spirit; to another, the grace of healing in one Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="10">To another, the working of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, the discerning of spirits; to another, diverse kinds of tongues; to another, interpretation of speeches.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But all these things one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to every one according as he will.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For as the body is one, and hath many members; and all the members of the body, whereas they are many, yet are one body, so also is Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free; and in one Spirit we have all been made to drink.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For the body also is not one member, but many.</verse>
  <verse number="15">If the foot should say, because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body ?</verse>
  <verse number="16">And if the ear should say, because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body ?</verse>
  <verse number="17">If the whole body were the eye, where would be the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where would be the smelling?</verse>
  <verse number="18">But now God hath set the members every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And if they all were one member, where would be the body?</verse>
  <verse number="20">But now there are many members indeed, yet one body.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the eye cannot say to the hand: I need not thy help; nor again the head to the feet: I have no need of you.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Yea, much more those that seem to be the more feeble members of the body, are more necessary.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And such as we think to be the less honourable members of the body, about these we put more abundant honour; and those that are our uncomely parts, have more abundant comeliness.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, giving to that which wanted the more abundant honour,</verse>
  <verse number="25">That there might be no schism in the body; but the members might be mutually careful one for another.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And if one member suffer any thing, all the members suffer with it; or if one member glory, all the members rejoice with it.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Now you are the body of Christ, and members of member.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And God indeed hath set some in the church; first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly doctors; after that miracles; then the graces of healing, helps, governments, kinds of tongues, interpretations of speeches.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all doctors?</verse>
  <verse number="30">Are all workers of miracles? Have all the grace of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</verse>
  <verse number="31">But be zealous for the better gifts. And I shew unto you yet a more excellent way.</verse>
