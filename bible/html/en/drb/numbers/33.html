<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And departing from Hesmona, they came to Moseroth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And removing from Moseroth, they camped in Benejaacan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And departing from Benejaacan, they came to mount Gadgad.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">From thence they went and camped in Jetebatha.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the Lord: and there he died in the fortieth year of the coming forth of the children of Israel out of Egypt, W the fifth month, the first day of the month,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">When he was a hundred and twenty-three years old.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="48">And departing from the mountains of Abarim, they passed to the plains of Moab, by the Jordan, over against Jericho.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">And there they camped from Bethsi moth even to Ablesatim in the plains of the Moabites,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">Where the Lord said to Moses:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">Command the children of Israel, and say to them: When you shall have passed over the Jordan, entering into the land of Chanaan,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">Destroy all the inhabitants of that land: beat down their pillars, and break in pieces their statues, and waste all their high places,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">Cleansing the land, and dwelling in it. For I have given it you for a possession.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">And you shall divide it among you by lot. To the more you shall give a larger part, and to the fewer a lesser. To every one as the lot shall fall, so shall the inheritance be given. The possession shall be divided by the tribes and the families.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">But if you will not kill the inhabitants of the land: they that remain, shall be unto you as nails in your eyes, and spears in your sides, and they shall be your adversaries in the land of your habitation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">And whatsoever I had thought to do to them, I will do to you.</p>
