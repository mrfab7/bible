<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Man knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have acquired a man with Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And she further bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a shepherd, but Cain was a husbandman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of their fat. And Jehovah looked upon Abel, and on his offering;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and upon Cain, and on his offering, he did not look. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Jehovah said to Cain, Why art thou angry, and why is thy countenance fallen?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If thou doest well, will not [thy countenance] look up [with confidence]? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door; and unto thee [shall be] his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Cain spoke to Abel his brother, and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Jehovah said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: am I my brother’s keeper?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood is crying to me from the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And now be thou cursed from the ground, which hath opened its mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield thee its strength; a wanderer and fugitive shalt thou be on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Cain said to Jehovah, My punishment is too great to be borne.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Behold, thou hast driven me this day from the face of the ground, and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a wanderer and fugitive on the earth; and it will come to pass, [that] every one who finds me will slay me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Jehovah said to him, Therefore, whoever slayeth Cain, it shall be revenged sevenfold. And Jehovah set a mark on Cain, lest any finding him should smite him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Cain went out from the presence of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, toward the east of Eden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he built a city; and he called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And to Enoch was born Irad; and Irad begot Mehujael; and Mehujael begot Methushael; and Methushael begot Lemech.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Lemech took two wives: the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the second, Zillah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Adah bore Jabal: he was the father of those who dwell in tents, and [breed] cattle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And his brother’s name was Jubal: he was the father of those who handle the harp and pipe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-Cain, the forger of every kind of tool of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Lemech said to his wives: Adah and Zillah, hear my voice, Ye wives of Lemech, listen to my speech. For I have slain a man for my wound, and a youth for my bruise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold; Lemech seventy and seven fold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth:... For God has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, because Cain has slain him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And to Seth, to him also was born a son; and he called his name Enosh. Then people began to call on the name of Jehovah.</p>
