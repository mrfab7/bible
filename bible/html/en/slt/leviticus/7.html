<p class="verse" data-verse="1">This the law of the trespass: it is holy of holies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">In the place where they shall slaughter the burnt-offering they shall slaughter the trespass: and he shall sprinkle its blood upon the altar round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he shall bring from it all its fat; the fat tail, and the fat covering the bowels,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the two kidneys, and the fat which is upon them, which is upon the loins, and the lobe upon the liver, with the kidneys, he shall take it away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the priest burnt them upon the altar, a sacrifice to Jehovah: it is a trespass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Every male among the priests shall eat it: in the holy place it shall be eaten: it is holy of holies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">As the sin, so the trespass: one law for them: the priest who shall expiate upon it, to him it shall be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the priest bringing near a manâ€™s burnt-offering, the skin of the burnt-offering which was brought near for the priest, to him it shall be.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And this the law of the sacrifice of peace which he shall bring to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If for praise he shall bring it, and he brought with the sacrifice of praise, unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and thin unleavened cakes anointed with oil, and fine flour dipped, cakes mixed in oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">With the cakes, leavened bread he shall bring, an offering upon the sacrifice of praise of his peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he brought from it one from all the offering an oblation to Jehovah, for the priest sprinkling the blood of peace, to him it shall be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the flesh of the sacrifice of praise of his peace, in the day of his offering shall be eaten; he shall not leave from it till morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And if a vow or a voluntary gift, the sacrifice of his offering in the day he brought it, his sacrifice it shall be eaten; and from the morrow that remaining from it shall be eaten.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the remainder from the flesh of the sacrifice in the third day shall be burnt in fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And if eating, he shall eat from the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace in the third day, it shall not be accepted; he bringing it near, it shall not be imputed to him: it shall be an abomination, and the soul eating from it shall bear its iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the flesh which shall touch upon any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt in fire: and of all clean flesh, the flesh shall be eaten.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And when a soul shall touch upon anything unclean, upon the uncleanness of man, or upon unclean cattle, or upon any abominable unclean thing, and eat from the flesh of the sacrifice of peace, which is to Jehovah, that soul was cut off from its people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, Any fat of ox, and lamb, and goat, ye shall not eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And the fat of a carcass, and the fat of the torn in pieces shall be worked for all work; and eating, ye shall not eat it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For every one eating the fat from the cattle that will be brought from it, a sacrifice to Jehovah, and the soul eating was cut off from its people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And any blood ye shall not eat in any of your dwellings, of fowl, and of cattle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Every soul which shall eat any blood, and that soul was cut off from its people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, He bringing near the sacrifice of his peace to Jehovah, shall brine his offering to Jehovah from the sacrifice of his peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">His hands shall bring the sacrifices of Jehovah: the fat upon the breast he shall bring it, the breast to lift it up a waving before Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And the priest burnt the fat upon the altar: and the breast was to Aaron and to his sons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And the right leg ye shall give an oblation to the priest from the sacrifices of your peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And he bringing near the blood of the peace, and the fat, from the sons of Aaron, to him shall be the right leg for a portion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For the breast of the waving and the leg of the oblation, I took from the sons of Israel from the sacrifices of peace, and I will give them to Aaron the priest, and to his sons for a law forever, from the sons of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">This the anointing of Aaron and of his sons from the sacrifices of Jehovah, in the day of bringing them to be priests to Jehovah;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Which Jehovah commanded to give to them in the day of his anointing them from the sons of Israel, a law forever to their generations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">This the law of the burnt-offering, for the gift, and for the sin, and for the trespass, and for the fulness, and for the sacrifice of the peace;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">Which Jehovah commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day of his commanding the sons of Israel to bring near their offerings to Jehovah, in the desert of Sinai.</p>
