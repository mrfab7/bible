<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="8" data-translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" data-translation-id="jps" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Doth not wisdom call, And understanding put forth her voice?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">In the top of high places by the way, Where the paths meet, she standeth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, At the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Unto you, O men, I call, And my voice is to the sons of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">O ye thoughtless, understand prudence, And, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Hear, for I will speak excellent things, And the opening of my lips shall be right things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For my mouth shall utter truth, And wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">All the words of my mouth are in righteousness, There is nothing perverse or crooked in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They are all plain to him that understandeth, And right to them that find knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Receive my instruction, and not silver, And knowledge rather than choice gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For wisdom is better than rubies, And all things desirable are not to be compared unto her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I wisdom dwell with prudence, And find out knowledge of devices.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The fear of the LORD is to hate evil; Pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, And the froward mouth, do I hate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom; I am understanding, power is mine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">By me kings reign, And princes decree justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">By me princes rule, And nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I love them that love me, And those that seek me earnestly shall find me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Riches and honour are with me; Yea, enduring riches and righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; And my produce than choice silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I walk in the way of righteousness, In the midst of the paths of justice;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, And that I may fill their treasuries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The LORD made me as the beginning of His way, The first of His works of old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, Or ever the earth was.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">When there were no depths, I was brought forth; When there were no fountains abounding with water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Before the mountains were settled, Before the hills was I brought forth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">While as yet He had not made the earth, nor the fields, Nor the beginning of the dust of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">When He established the heavens, I was there; When He set a circle upon the face of the deep,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">When He made firm the skies above, When the fountains of the deep showed their might,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">When He gave to the sea His decree, That the waters should not transgress His commandment, When He appointed the foundations of the earth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Then I was by Him, as a nursling; And I was daily all delight, Playing always before Him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Playing in His habitable earth, And my delights are with the sons of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Now therefore, ye children, hearken unto me; For happy are they that keep my ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Hear instruction, and be wise, And refuse it not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Happy is the man that hearkeneth to me, Watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">For whoso findeth me findeth life, And obtaineth favour of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">But he that misseth me wrongeth his own soul; All they that hate me love death.â€™</p>
