<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jonas prayed to the Lord his God out of the belly of the fish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he said: I cried out of my affliction to the Lord, and he heard me: I cried out of the belly of hell, and thou hast heard my voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And thou hast cast me forth into the deep in the heart of the sea, and a flood hath compassed me: all thy billows, and thy waves have passed over me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I said: I am cast away out of the sight of thy eyes: but yet I shall see thy holy temple again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The waters compassed me about even to the soul: the deep hath closed me round about, the sea hath covered my head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I went down to the lowest parts of the mountains: the bars of the earth have shut me up for ever: and thou wilt bring up my life from corruption, O Lord my God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When my soul was in distress within me, I remembered the Lord: that my prayer may come to thee, unto thy holy temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They that are vain observe vanities, forsake their own mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But I with the voice of praise will sacrifice to thee: I will pay whatsoever I have vowed for my salvation to the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the Lord spoke to the fish: and it vomited out Jonas upon the dry land.</p>
