<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="2" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For if I make you sorry, who is he then that makes me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I wrote this same to you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly to you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But if any have caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.</verse>
  <verse number="7">So that contrariwise you ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Why I beseech you that you would confirm your love toward him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether you be obedient in all things.</verse>
  <verse number="10">To whom you forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="11">Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ’s gospel, and a door was opened to me of the Lord,</verse>
  <verse number="13">I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Now thanks be to God, which always causes us to triumph in Christ, and makes manifest the aroma of his knowledge by us in every place.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For we are to God a sweet smell of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</verse>
  <verse number="16">To the one we are the smell of death to death; and to the other the smell of life to life. And who is sufficient for these things?</verse>
  <verse number="17">For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</verse>
