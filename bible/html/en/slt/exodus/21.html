<p class="verse" data-verse="2">If thou shalt buy a Hebrew servant, six years shall he serve: and in the seventh he shall go forth free gratuitously.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If he shall come in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he possessed a wife, and his wife shall go forth with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If his lord shall give to hint a wife, and she brought to him sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall be to her lord, and he shall go forth by himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And if saying, the servant shall say, I loved my lord, my wife and my sons; I will not go forth free:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And his lord brought him near to God, and he brought him near to the door, or to the door-post, and his lord pierced his ear with an awl; and he served him forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And if a man shall sell his daughter for a maid, she shall not go forth as the servants went forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">If evil in the eyes of her lord, he did not betroth her and he ransomed her: to a strange people he shall not have power to sell her, in his acting deceitfully by her.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If he shall rise and go forth without upon his support, and he smiting being innocent, only he shall give his resting, and healing, he shall be healed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And if a man shall strike his servant or his maid with a rod, and he died under his hand, avenging, he shall be avenged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But if a day or two days he shall stand, he shall not be avenged, for he is his silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And if men shall quarrel and strike a woman pregnant, and her child shall go forth, and there shall not be harm, punishing, he shall be punished, as the husband of the woman shall put upon him; and he giving in justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And if there shall be harm, and he gave soul for soul,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="31">If he shall push (with his horns) a son, or shall push a daughter, according to this judgment it shall be done to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">If the ox shall push a servant, or a maid, he shall give thirty shekels of silver to his lord, and the ox shall be stoned.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="34">The lord of the pit shall recompense; he shall turn back silver to his lord and the dead shall be to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And if a manâ€™s ox shall strike the ox of his friend and he died, and they shall sell the living ox and divide the silver, and also the dead ox they shall divide.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Or if this ox was known to push from yesterday, the third day, and his lord guarded him not; recompensing, he shall recompense, ox for ox, and the dead shall be to him.</p>
