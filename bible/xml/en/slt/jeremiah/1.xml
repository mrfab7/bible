  <verse number="1">The words of Jeremiah son of Hillkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:</verse>
  <verse number="2">When the word of Jehovah was to him in the days of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year to his reigning.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And it will be in the days of Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, even to the fulness of the eleventh year to Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah, even to the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Before I shall form thee in the belly, I knew thee; and before thou shalt go forth from the womb I consecrated thee; I gave thee a prophet to the nations.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And saying, Ah, Lord Jehovah, behold I knew not to speak: for I a boy.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Jehovah will say to me, Thou shalt not say, I a boy; for thou shalt go to all to whom I shall send thee, and all which I shall command thee thou shalt speak.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thou shalt not be afraid of their faces, for I am with thee to deliver thee, says Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Jehovah will stretch forth his hand and touch upon my mouth: and Jehovah will say to me, Behold, I gave my words into thy mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="10">See, I appointed thee this day over the nations and over the kingdoms to pluck up and to tear down, and to destroy, and to overthrow, to build and to plant.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying, What seem thou, Jeremiah? and saying, I see the shoot of an almond tree.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Jehovah will say to me, Thou didst well to see; for I watch upon my word to do it.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the word of Jehovah will be to me the second time, saying, What seest thou? and saying, I see a pot blown under, and its face from the face of the north.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Jehovah will say to me, From the north shall evil be opened upon all the inhabitants of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For behold me calling to all the families of the kingdoms of the north, says Jehovah; and they came, and gave a man his throne at the opening of the gates of Jerusalem, and upon all her walls round about and upon all the cities of Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And I spake my judgment with them concerning all their evil, who forsook me, and they will burn incense to other gods, and they will worship to the works of their hands.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And thou shalt gird thy loins and rise and speak to them all that I shall command thee: thou shalt not be terrified from their face lest I shall break thee before them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Behold, I gave thee this day for a fortified city and for a pillar of iron and for a wall of brass upon all the land to the kings of Judah, to her chiefs, to her priests, and to the people of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And they warred against thee; and they shall not prevail against thee, for I am with thee, says Jehovah, to deliver thee.</verse>
