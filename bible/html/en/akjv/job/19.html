<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="19" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How long will you vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">These ten times have you reproached me: you are not ashamed that you make yourselves strange to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And be it indeed that I have erred, my error remains with myself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Know now that God has overthrown me, and has compassed me with his net.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He has fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he has set darkness in my paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He has stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He has destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and my hope has he removed like a tree.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He has also kindled his wrath against me, and he counts me to him as one of his enemies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He has put my brothers far from me, and my acquaintance are truly estranged from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I entreated him with my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">My breath is strange to my wife, though I entreated for the childrenâ€™s sake of my own body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Yes, young children despised me; I arose, and they spoke against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My bone sticks to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Have pity on me, have pity on me, O you my friends; for the hand of God has touched me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Why do you persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For I know that my redeemer lives, and that he shall stand at the latter day on the earth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">But you should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Be you afraid of the sword: for wrath brings the punishments of the sword, that you may know there is a judgment.</p>
