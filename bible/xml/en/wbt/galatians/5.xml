  <verse number="1">Stand fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Behold, I Paul say to you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Christ is become of no effect to you, whoever of you are justified by the law; ye have fallen from grace.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Ye did run well, who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth?</verse>
  <verse number="8">This persuasion cometh not from him that calleth you.</verse>
  <verse number="9">A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be no otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whoever he may be.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then hath the offense of the cross ceased.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I would they were even cut off who trouble you.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For, brethren, ye have been called to liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one by another.</verse>
  <verse number="16">This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye will not fulfill the lust of the flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other; so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these, Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</verse>
  <verse number="20">Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,</verse>
  <verse number="21">Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And they that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts.</verse>
  <verse number="25">If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Let us not be desirous of vain-glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</verse>
