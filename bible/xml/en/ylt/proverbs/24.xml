<chapter book="Proverbs" number="24" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Be not envious of evil men, And desire not to be with them.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For destruction doth their heart meditate, And perverseness do their lips speak.</verse>
  <verse number="3">By wisdom is a house builded, And by understanding it establisheth itself.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And by knowledge the inner parts are filled, With all precious and pleasant wealth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Mighty is the wise in strength, And a man of knowledge is strengthening power,</verse>
  <verse number="6">For by plans thou makest for thyself war, And deliverance is in a multitude of counsellors.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Wisdom is high for a fool, In the gate he openeth not his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Whoso is devising to do evil, Him they call a master of wicked thoughts.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The thought of folly is sin, And an abomination to man is a scorner.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Thou hast shewed thyself weak in a day of adversity, Straitened is thy power,</verse>
  <verse number="11">If from delivering those taken to death, And those slipping to the slaughter—thou keepest back.</verse>
  <verse number="12">When thou sayest, ‘Lo, we knew not this.’ Is not the Ponderer of hearts He who understandeth? And the Keeper of thy soul He who knoweth? And He hath rendered to man according to his work.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Eat my son, honey that is good, And the honeycomb—sweet to thy palate.</verse>
  <verse number="14">So is the knowledge of wisdom to thy soul, If thou hast found that there is a posterity And thy hope is not cut off.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Lay not wait, O wicked one, At the habitation of the righteous. Do not spoil his resting-place.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For seven times doth the righteous fall and rise, And the wicked stumble in evil.</verse>
  <verse number="17">In the falling of thine enemy rejoice not, And in his stumbling let not thy heart be joyful,</verse>
  <verse number="18">Lest Jehovah see, and it be evil in His eyes, And He hath turned from off him His anger.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Fret not thyself at evil doers, Be not envious at the wicked,</verse>
  <verse number="20">For there is not a posterity to the evil, The lamp of the wicked is extinguished.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Fear Jehovah, my son, and the king, With changers mix not up thyself,</verse>
  <verse number="22">For suddenly doth their calamity rise, And the ruin of them both—who knoweth!</verse>
  <verse number="23">These also are for the wise:—To discern faces in judgment is not good.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Whoso is saying to the wicked, ‘Thou art righteous,’ Peoples execrate him—nations abhor him.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And to those reproving it is pleasant, And on them cometh a good blessing.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Lips he kisseth who is returning straightforward words.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Prepare in an out-place thy work, And make it ready in the field—go afterwards, Then thou hast built thy house.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Be not a witness for nought against thy neighbour, Or thou hast enticed with thy lips.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Say not, ‘As he did to me, so I do to him, I render to each according to his work.’</verse>
  <verse number="30">Near the field of a slothful man I passed by, And near the vineyard of a man lacking heart.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And lo, it hath gone up—all of it—thorns! Covered its face have nettles, And its stone wall hath been broken down.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And I see—I—I do set my heart, I have seen—I have received instruction,</verse>
  <verse number="33">A little sleep—a little slumber—A little folding of the hands to lie down.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And thy poverty hath come as a traveller, And thy want as an armed man!</verse>
