<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear diligently my speech; And let this be your consolations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Suffer me, that I may speak; And after that I have spoken, mock on.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">As for me, is my complaint to man? Or why should I not be impatient?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Turn unto me, and be astonished, And lay your hand upon your mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Even when I remember I am affrighted, And horror hath taketh hold on my flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wherefore do the wicked live, Become old, yea, wax mighty in power?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Their seed is established in their sight with them, And their offspring before their eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Their houses are safe, without fear, Neither is the rod of God upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They send forth their little ones like a flock, And their children dance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They sing to the timbrel and harp, And rejoice at the sound of the pipe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They spend their days in prosperity, And peacefully they go down to the grave.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Yet they said unto God: ‘Depart from us; For we desire not the knowledge of Thy ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto Him?’—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand; The counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity cometh upon them? That He distributeth pains in His anger?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">That they are as stubble before the wind, And as chaff that the storm stealeth away?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">God layeth up his iniquity for his children!’—Let Him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Let his own eyes see his destruction, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For what pleasure hath he in his house after him? Seeing the number of his months is determined.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Shall any teach God knowledge? Seeing it is He that judgeth those that are high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">One dieth in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and quiet;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">His pails are full of milk, And the marrow of his bones is moistened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And another dieth in bitterness of soul, And hath never tasted of good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">They lie down alike in the dust, And the worm covereth them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Behold, I know your thoughts, And the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For ye say: ‘Where is the house of the prince? And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Have ye not asked them that go by the way; And will ye misdeem their tokens,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity, That they are led forth to the day of wrath?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But who shall declare his way to his face? And who shall repay him what he hath done?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For he is borne to the grave, And watch is kept over his tomb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The clods of the valley are sweet unto him, And all men draw after him, As there were innumerable before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">How then comfort ye me in vain? And as for your answers, there remaineth only faithlessness?</p>
