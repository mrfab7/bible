<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who can say: ‘I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin’?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Divers weights, and divers measures, Both of them alike are abomination to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Even a child is known by his doings, Whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="15">There is gold, and a multitude of rubies; But the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Take his garment that is surety for a stranger; And hold him in pledge that is surety for an alien woman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Bread of falsehood is sweet to a man; But afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Every purpose is established by counsel; And with good advice carry on war.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Whoso curseth his father or his mother, His lamp shall be put out in the blackest darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">An estate may be gotten hastily at the beginning; But the end thereof shall not be blessed.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="25">It is a snare to a man rashly to say: ‘Holy’, And after vows to make inquiry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">A wise king sifteth the wicked, And turneth the wheel over them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The spirit of man is the lamp of the LORD, Searching all the inward parts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Mercy and truth preserve the king; And his throne is upheld by mercy.</p>
