  <verse number="1">But Eliphaz the Themanite, answering, said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Will a wise man answer as if he were speaking wind, and will he fill his stomach with fire?</verse>
  <verse number="3">You rebuke with words he who is not equal to you, and you speak what is not expedient for you,</verse>
  <verse number="4">to such an extent that, within yourself, you have expelled reverence and have taken away prayers from the presence of God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For your iniquity has mislead your mouth, and you imitate the tongue of blasphemers.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Your own mouth will condemn you, not I; and your own lips will answer you.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Are you the first man who was born, or were you formed before the hills?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Have you heard the intentions of God, and will his wisdom be inferior to you?</verse>
  <verse number="9">What do you know, about which we are ignorant? What do you understand that we do not know?</verse>
  <verse number="10">There are with us both aged and ancient men, even more senior than your fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Is it so important that God should console you? But your own depraved words prevent this.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Why does your heart exalt you, and why do you gaze with your eyes, as if thinking great things?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Why does your spirit stir against God, so as to utter such speeches from your mouth?</verse>
  <verse number="14">What is man that he should be immaculate, and that he should appear just, having been born of woman?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Behold, among his holy ones not one is immutable, and even the heavens are not pure in his sight.</verse>
  <verse number="16">How much more abominable and useless is the man who drinks as if from the water of iniquity?</verse>
  <verse number="17">I will reveal to you, so listen to me; and I will explain to you what I have seen.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The wise acknowledge, and they do not leave behind, their fathers,</verse>
  <verse number="19">to whom alone the earth has been given, and no stranger passed among them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The impious is arrogant for all his days, and the number of the years of his tyranny is uncertain.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The sound of terror is always in his ears; and when there is peace, he always suspects treason.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He does not believe that it is possible for him to be turned from darkness into the light, for he sees around him the sword on every side.</verse>
  <verse number="23">When he moves himself to seek bread, he knows that the day of darkness has been prepared for his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Tribulation will terrify him, and anguish will prevail over him, like a king who is being prepared to go to battle.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For he has extended his hand against God, and he has strengthened himself against the Almighty.</verse>
  <verse number="26">He has rushed against him with his throat exposed, and he has been armed with a fat neck.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Thickness has covered his face, and lard hangs down from his sides.</verse>
  <verse number="28">He has lived in desolate cities and deserted houses, which have been turned into tombs.</verse>
  <verse number="29">He will not be enriched, nor will his basic necessities endure, nor will he establish his root in the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="30">He will not withdraw from the darkness; the flame will burn up his branches, and he will be defeated by the breath of his own mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="31">He will not believe, being vainly deceived by error, that he could be redeemed at any price.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Before his time is completed, he will pass into ruin and his hands will wither away.</verse>
  <verse number="33">He will be wounded like a grapevine, when its cluster is in first flower, and like an olive tree that casts off its flower.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For the congregation of the hypocrites is fruitless, and fire will devour the tabernacles of those who love to accept money.</verse>
  <verse number="35">He has conceived sorrow, and he has brought forth iniquity, and his womb prepares deceit.</verse>
