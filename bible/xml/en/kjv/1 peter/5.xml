<chapter book="1 Peter" number="5" translation="King James Bible" translationID="kjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight [thereof], not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;</verse>
  <verse number="3">Neither as being lords over [God’s] heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all [of you] be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</verse>
  <verse number="7">Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle [you].</verse>
  <verse number="11">To him [be] glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="12">By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The [church that is] at Babylon, elected together with [you], saluteth you; and [so doth] Marcus my son.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace [be] with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</verse>
