<chapter book="Ezekiel" number="23" translation="Webster Bible Translation" translationID="wbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And they committed lewd deeds in Egypt; they committed lewd deeds in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they were first corrupted.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bore sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Who were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thus she committed her lewd deeds with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Neither left she her lewd deeds brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they first corrupted her, and poured their impurities upon her.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Wherefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.</verse>
  <verse number="10">These uncovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment upon her.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her prostitutions more than her sister in her prostitutions.</verse>
  <verse number="12">She doted upon the Assyrians her neighbors, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And that she increased her prostitutions: for when she saw men pourtrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans pourtrayed with vermilion.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Girded with girdles upon their loins, exceeding in dyed attire upon their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:</verse>
  <verse number="16">And as soon as she saw them with her eyes she doted upon them, and sent messengers to them into Chaldea.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their lewdness, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">So she disclosed her lewd deeds, and exposed her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, as my mind was alienated from her sister.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Yet she multiplied her prostitutions, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, in which she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Thus thou calledst to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, by being corrupted by the Egyptians in thy youth.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Therefore, O Aholibah, thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy mind is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side;</verse>
  <verse number="23">The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding upon horses.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet on every side: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their judgments.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal furiously with thee: they shall take away thy nose and thy ears; and thy remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy residue shall be devoured by the fire.</verse>
  <verse number="26">They shall also strip thee of thy clothes, and take away thy fair jewels.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee, and thy adultery brought from the land of Egypt: so that thou shalt not lift up thy eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.</verse>
  <verse number="28">For thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver thee into the hand of them whom thou hatest, into the hand of them from whom thy mind is alienated:</verse>
  <verse number="29">And they shall treat thee with hatred, and shall take away all thy labor, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy prostitutions shall be disclosed, both thy lewdness and thy prostitutions.</verse>
  <verse number="30">I will do these things to thee, because thou hast gone astray after the heathen, and because thou art polluted with their idols.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore will I give her cup into thy hand.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup deep and large: thou shalt be treated with scorn and had in derision; it containeth much.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Thou shalt even drink it, and empty it to the dregs, and thou shalt break its pieces, and pluck off thy own breasts: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy prostitutions.</verse>
  <verse number="36">The LORD said moreover to me; Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah? yes, declare to them their abominations;</verse>
  <verse number="37">That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.</verse>
  <verse number="38">Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.</verse>
  <verse number="39">For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and lo, thus have they done in the midst of my house.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, to whom a messenger was sent; and lo, they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, paint thy eyes, and deck thyself with ornaments,</verse>
  <verse number="41">And sattest upon a stately bed and a table prepared before it, upon which thou hast set my incense and my oil.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, who put bracelets upon their hands, and beautiful crowns upon their heads.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Then said I to her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit lewd deeds with her, and she with them?</verse>
  <verse number="44">Yet they went in to her, as they go in to a woman that playeth the harlot: so they went in to Aholah and to Aholibah, the lewd women.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.</verse>
  <verse number="46">For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company upon them, and will give them to be removed and plundered.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn their houses with fire.</verse>
  <verse number="48">Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.</verse>
  <verse number="49">And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols: and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.</verse>
