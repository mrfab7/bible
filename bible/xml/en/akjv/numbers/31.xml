  <verse number="1">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward shall you be gathered to your people.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves to the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel, shall you send to the war.</verse>
  <verse number="5">So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded Moses; and they slew all the males.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelled, and all their goodly castles, with fire.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, to Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation of the children of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Moses said to them, Have you saved all the women alive?</verse>
  <verse number="16">Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that has known man by lying with him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And do you abide without the camp seven days: whoever has killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats’ hair, and all things made of wood.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Eleazar the priest said to the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses;</verse>
  <verse number="22">Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Every thing that may abide the fire, you shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that stays not the fire you shall make go through the water.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall be clean, and afterward you shall come into the camp.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="26">Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, you, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation:</verse>
  <verse number="27">And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war on them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation:</verse>
  <verse number="28">And levy a tribute to the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:</verse>
  <verse number="29">Take it of their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And of the children of Israel’s half, you shall take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them to the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,</verse>
  <verse number="33">And three score and twelve thousand beeves,</verse>
  <verse number="34">And three score and one thousand asses,</verse>
  <verse number="35">And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep:</verse>
  <verse number="37">And the LORD’s tribute of the sheep was six hundred and three score and fifteen.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD’s tribute was three score and twelve.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD’s tribute was three score and one.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD’s tribute was thirty and two persons.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD’s heave offering, to Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And of the children of Israel’s half, which Moses divided from the men that warred,</verse>
  <verse number="43">(Now the half that pertained to the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep,</verse>
  <verse number="44">And thirty and six thousand beeves,</verse>
  <verse number="45">And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,</verse>
  <verse number="46">And sixteen thousand persons;)</verse>
  <verse number="47">Even of the children of Israel’s half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them to the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near to Moses:</verse>
  <verse number="49">And they said to Moses, Your servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacks not one man of us.</verse>
  <verse number="50">We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man has gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="51">And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all worked jewels.</verse>
  <verse number="52">And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.</verse>
  <verse number="53">(For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)</verse>
  <verse number="54">And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD.</verse>
