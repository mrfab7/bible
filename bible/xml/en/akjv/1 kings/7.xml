  <verse number="1">But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the length thereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And it was covered with cedar above on the beams, that lay on forty five pillars, fifteen in a row.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And there were windows in three rows, and light was against light in three ranks.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: and light was against light in three ranks.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch was before them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were before them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And his house where he dwelled had another court within the porch, which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like to this porch.</verse>
  <verse number="9">All these were of costly stones, according to the measures of hewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside toward the great court.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones, and cedars.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the great court round about was with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of the house of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He was a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, and understanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came to king Solomon, and worked all his work.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece: and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he made two capitals of molten brass, to set on the tops of the pillars: the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits:</verse>
  <verse number="17">And nets of checker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital, and seven for the other capital.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he made the pillars, and two rows round about on the one network, to cover the capitals that were on the top, with pomegranates: and so did he for the other capital.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the capitals that were on the top of the pillars were of lily work in the porch, four cubits.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the capitals on the two pillars had pomegranates also above, over against the belly which was by the network: and the pomegranates were two hundred in rows round about on the other capital.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And on the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work of the pillars finished.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops were cast in two rows, when it was cast.</verse>
  <verse number="25">It stood on twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above on them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof was worked like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of one base, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the height of it.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders, and the borders were between the ledges:</verse>
  <verse number="29">And on the borders that were between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubim: and on the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of thin work.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners thereof had supports: under the laver were supports molten, at the side of every addition.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the mouth of it within the capital and above was a cubit: but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubit and an half: and also on the mouth of it were engravings with their borders, foursquare, not round.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of the wheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubit and half a cubit.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel: their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes, were all molten.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And there were four supports to the four corners of one base: and the supports were of the very base itself.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half a cubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and the borders thereof were of the same.</verse>
  <verse number="36">For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof, he graved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the proportion of every one, and additions round about.</verse>
  <verse number="37">After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had one casting, one measure, and one size.</verse>
  <verse number="38">Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained forty baths: and every laver was four cubits: and on every one of the ten bases one laver.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side of the house eastward over against the south.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon for the house of the LORD:</verse>
  <verse number="41">The two pillars, and the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the two pillars; and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the capitals which were on the top of the pillars;</verse>
  <verse number="42">And four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars;</verse>
  <verse number="43">And the ten bases, and ten lavers on the bases;</verse>
  <verse number="44">And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;</verse>
  <verse number="45">And the pots, and the shovels, and the basins: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the LORD, were of bright brass.</verse>
  <verse number="46">In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they were exceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained to the house of the LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon the show bread was,</verse>
  <verse number="49">And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on the right side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold,</verse>
  <verse number="50">And the bowls, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the spoons, and the censers of pure gold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of the temple.</verse>
  <verse number="51">So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he put among the treasures of the house of the LORD.</verse>
