<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="17" data-translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" data-translation-id="jps" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct, The grave is ready for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Surely there are mockers with me, And mine eye abideth in their provocation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Give now a pledge, be surety for me with Thyself; Who else is there that will strike hands with me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For Thou hast hid their heart from understanding; Therefore shalt Thou not exalt them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He that denounceth his friends for the sake of flattery, Even the eyes of his children shall fail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He hath made me also a byword of the people; And I am become one in whose face they spit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Mine eye also is dimmed by reason of vexation, And all my members are as a shadow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Upright men are astonished at this, And the innocent stirreth up himself against the godless.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Yet the righteous holdeth on his way, And he that hath clean hands waxeth stronger and stronger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But as for you all, do ye return, and come now; And I shall not find a wise man among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My days are past, my purposes are broken off, Even the thoughts of my heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They change the night into day; The light is short because of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I look for the nether-world as my house; If I have spread my couch in the darkness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If I have said to corruption: ‘Thou art my father’, To the worm: ‘Thou art my mother, and my sister’;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Where then is my hope? And as for my hope, who shall see it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">They shall go down to the bars of the nether-world, When we are at rest together in the dust.</p>
