<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Baldad the Suhite answered, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How long will you throw out words? understand first, and so let us speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Why are we reputed as beasts, and counted vile before you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thou that destroyest thy soul in thy fury, shall the earth be forsaken for thee, and shall rocks be removed out of their place?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Shall not the light of the wicked be extinguished, and the flame of his fire not shine?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and the lamp that is over him, shall be put out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The step of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down headlong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For he hath thrust his feet into a net, and walketh in its meshes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The sole of his foot shall be held in a snare, and thirst shall burn against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A gin is hidden for him in the earth, and his trap upon the path.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Fears shall terrify him on every side, and shall entangle his feet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let his strength be wasted with famine, and let hunger invade his ribs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Let it devour the beauty of his skin, let the firstborn death consume his arms.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Let his confidence be rooted out of his tabernacle, and let destruction tread upon him like a king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Let the companions of him that is not, dwell in his tabernacle, let brimstone be sprinkled in his tent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let his roots be dried up beneath, and his harvest destroyed above.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Let the memory of him perish from the earth and let not his name be renowned in the streets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He shall drive him out of light into darkness, and shall remove him out of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">His seed shall not subsist, nor his offspring among his people, nor any remnants in his country.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">They that come after him shall be astonished at his day, and horror shall fall upon them that went before.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">These men are the tabernacles of the wicked, and this the place of him that knoweth not God.</p>
