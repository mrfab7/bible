  <verse number="1">“Come down, and sit in the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground without a throne, daughter of the Chaldeans: for you shall no more be called tender and delicate.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Take the millstones, and grind meal; remove your veil, strip off the train, uncover the leg, pass through the rivers.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Your nakedness shall be uncovered, yes, your shame shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and will spare no man.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">Our Redeemer, Yahweh of Armies is his name, the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="5">“Sit in silence, and go into darkness, daughter of the Chaldeans; for you shall no more be called the mistress of kingdoms.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I was angry with my people, I profaned my inheritance, and gave them into your hand: you showed them no mercy; on the aged you have very heavily laid your yoke.</verse>
  <verse number="7">You said, ‘I shall be a mistress forever;’ so that you did not lay these things to your heart, nor did you remember the latter end of it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">“Now therefore hear this, you who are given to pleasures, who sit securely, who say in your heart, ‘I am, and there is none else besides me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children:’</verse>
  <verse number="9">but these two things shall come to you in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood; in their full measure shall they come on you, in the multitude of your sorceries, and the great abundance of your enchantments.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For you have trusted in your wickedness; you have said, No one sees me; your wisdom and your knowledge, it has perverted you, and you have said in your heart, I am, and there is none else besides me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Therefore evil will come on you; you won’t know when it dawns: and mischief will fall on you; you will not be able to put it away: and desolation shall come on you suddenly, which you don’t know.</verse>
  <verse number="12">“Stand now with your enchantments, and with the multitude of your sorceries, in which you have labored from your youth; if so be you shall be able to profit, if so be you may prevail.</verse>
  <verse number="13">You are wearied in the multitude of your counsels: let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save you from the things that shall come on you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame: it shall not be a coal to warm at, nor a fire to sit before.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thus shall the things be to you in which you have labored: those who have trafficked with you from your youth shall wander everyone to his quarter; there shall be none to save you.</verse>
