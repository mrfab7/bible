<p class="verse" data-verse="1">‘And thou hast made the altar of shittim wood, five cubits the length, and five cubits the breadth—the altar is square—and three cubits its height.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And thou hast made its horns on its four corners, its horns are of the same, and thou hast overlaid it with brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And thou hast made its pots to remove its ashes, and its shovels, and its bowls, and its forks, and its fire-pans, even all its vessels thou dost make of brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">‘And thou hast made for it a grate of net-work of brass, and hast made on the net four rings of brass on its four extremities,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and hast put it under the compass of the altar beneath, and the net hath been unto the middle of the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And thou hast made staves for the altar, staves of shittim wood, and hast overlaid them with brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the staves have been brought into the rings, and the staves have been on the two sides of the altar in bearing it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Hollow with boards thou dost make it, as it hath been shewed thee in the mount, so do they make it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And thou hast made the court of the tabernacle: for the south side southward, hangings for the court of twined linen, a hundred by the cubit is the length for the one side,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets are of brass, the pegs of the pillars and their fillets are of silver;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and so for the north side in length, hangings of a hundred cubits in length, and its twenty pillars and their twenty sockets are of brass, the pegs of the pillars and their fillets are of silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And for the breadth of the court at the west side are hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten, and their sockets ten.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And for the breadth of the court at the east side, eastward, are fifty cubits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And the hangings at the side are fifteen cubits, their pillars three, and their sockets three.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And at the second side are hangings fifteen cubits, their pillars three, and their sockets three.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">‘And for the gate of the court a covering of twenty cubits, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen, work of an embroiderer; their pillars four, their sockets four.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">All the pillars of the court round about are filleted with silver, their pegs are silver, and their sockets brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The length of the court is a hundred by the cubit, and the breadth fifty by fifty, and the height five cubits, of twined linen, and their sockets are brass,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">even all the vessels of the tabernacle, in all its service, and all its pins, and all the pins of the court, are brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">‘And thou—thou dost command the sons of Israel, and they bring unto thee pure beaten olive oil for the light, to cause the lamp to go up continually;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">in the tent of meeting, at the outside of the vail, which is over the testimony, doth Aaron—his sons also—arrange it from evening till morning before Jehovah—a statute age-during to their generations, from the sons of Israel.</p>
