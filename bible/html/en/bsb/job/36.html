<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Elihu continued:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Bear with me a little longer, and I will show you that there is more to be said on God’s behalf.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I get my knowledge from afar, and I will ascribe justice to my Maker.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For truly my words are free of falsehood; one perfect in knowledge is with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Indeed, God is mighty, but He despises no one; He is mighty in strength of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He does not keep the wicked alive, but He grants justice to the afflicted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He does not take His eyes off the righteous, but He enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And if men are bound with chains, caught in cords of affliction,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">then He tells them their deeds and how arrogantly they have transgressed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He opens their ears to correction and commands that they turn from iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If they obey and serve Him, then they end their days in prosperity and their years in happiness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But if they do not obey, then they perish by the sword and die without knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when He binds them, they do not cry for help.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">They die in their youth, among the male shrine prostitutes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">God rescues the afflicted by their affliction and opens their ears in oppression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Indeed, He drew you from the jaws of distress to a spacious and broad place, to a table full of richness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have seized you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Be careful that no one lures you with riches; do not let a large bribe lead you astray.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Can your wealth or all your mighty effort keep you from distress?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Do not long for the night, when people vanish from their homes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Be careful not to turn to iniquity, for this you have preferred to affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Behold, God is exalted in His power. Who is a teacher like Him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Who has appointed His way for Him, or told Him, ‘You have done wrong’?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Remember to magnify His work, which men have praised in song.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">All mankind has seen it; men behold it from afar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Indeed, God is great—beyond our knowledge; the number of His years is unsearchable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For He draws up drops of water which distill the rain from the mist,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">which the clouds pour out and shower abundantly on mankind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Furthermore, who can understand how the clouds spread out, how the thunder roars from His pavilion?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">See how He scatters His lightning around Him and covers the depths of the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For by these He judges the nations and provides food in abundance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He fills His hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The thunder declares His presence; even the cattle regard the rising storm.</p>
