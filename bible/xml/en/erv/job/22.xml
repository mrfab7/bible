  <verse number="1">Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Can a man be profitable unto God? surely he that is wise is profitable unto himself.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Is it for thy fear of him that he reproveth thee, that he entereth with thee into judgment?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Is not thy wickedness great? neither is there any end to thine iniquities.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For thou hast taken pledges of thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man, he dwelt in it.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee,</verse>
  <verse number="11">Or darkness, that thou canst not see, and abundance of waters cover thee.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!</verse>
  <verse number="13">And thou sayest, What doth God know? can he judge through the thick darkness?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Wilt thou keep the old way which wicked men have trodden?</verse>
  <verse number="16">Who were snatched away before their time, whose foundation was poured out as a stream:</verse>
  <verse number="17">Who said unto God, Depart from us; and, What can the Almighty do for us?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Yet he fired their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The righteous see it, and are glad; and the innocent laugh them to scorn:</verse>
  <verse number="20">Saying, Surely they that did rise up against us are cut off, and the remnant of them the fire hath consumed.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up; if thou put away unrighteousness far from thy tents.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And lay thou thy treasure in the dust, and the gold of Ophir among the stones of the brooks;</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the Almighty shall be thy treasure, and precious silver unto thee.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For then shalt thou delight thyself in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee; and thou shalt pay thy vows.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee; and light shall shine upon thy ways.</verse>
  <verse number="29">When they cast thee down, thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and the humble person he shall save.</verse>
  <verse number="30">He shall deliver even him that is not innocent: yea, he shall be delivered through the cleanness of thine hands.</verse>
