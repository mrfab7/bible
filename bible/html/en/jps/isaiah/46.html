<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="46" data-translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" data-translation-id="jps" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth; Their idols are upon the beasts, and upon the cattle; The things that ye carried about are made a load, A burden to the weary beast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">They stoop, they bow down together, They could not deliver the burden; And themselves are gone into captivity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Hearken unto Me, O house of Jacob, And all the remnant of the house of Israel, That are borne [by Me] from the birth, That are carried from the womb:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Even to old age I am the same, And even to hoar hairs will I carry you; I have made, and I will bear; Yea, I will carry, and will deliver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">To whom will ye liken Me, and make Me equal, And compare Me, that we may be like?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Ye that lavish gold out of the bag, And weigh silver in the balance; Ye that hire a goldsmith, that he make it a god, To fall down thereto, yea, to worship.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He is borne upon the shoulder, he is carried, And set in his place, and he standeth, From his place he doth not remove; Yea, though one cry unto him, he cannot answer, Nor save him out of his trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Remember this, and stand fast; Bring it to mind, O ye transgressors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Remember the former things of old: That I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like Me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Declaring the end from the beginning, And from ancient times things that are not yet done; Saying: ‘My counsel shall stand, And all My pleasure will I do’;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Calling a bird of prey from the east, The man of My counsel from a far country; Yea, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass, I have purposed, I will also do it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Hearken unto Me, ye stout-hearted, That are far from righteousness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">I bring near My righteousness, it shall not be far off, And My salvation shall not tarry; And I will place salvation in Zion For Israel My glory.</p>
