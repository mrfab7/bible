<div class="chapter" data-book="Hosea" data-chapter="7" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When I heal Israel, the iniquity of Ephraim will be exposed, as well as the crimes of Samaria. For they practice deceit and thieves break in; bandits raid in the streets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">But they fail to consider in their hearts that I remember all their evil. Now their deeds are all around them; they are before My face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They delight the king with their evil, and the princes with their lies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They are all adulterers, like an oven heated by a baker who needs not stoke the fire from the kneading to the rising of the dough.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The princes are inflamed with wine on the day of our king; so he joins hands with those who mock him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For they prepare their heart like an oven while they lie in wait; all night their anger smolders; in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All of them are hot as an oven, and they devour their rulers. All their kings fall; not one of them calls upon Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Ephraim mixes with the nations; Ephraim is an unturned cake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Foreigners consume his strength, but he does not notice. Even his hair is streaked with gray, but he does not know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Israel’s arrogance testifies against them, yet they do not return to the LORD their God; despite all this, they do not seek Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">So Ephraim has become like a silly, senseless dove—calling out to Egypt, then turning to Assyria.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">As they go, I will spread My net over them; I will bring them down like birds of the air. I will chastise them when I hear them flocking together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Woe to them, for they have strayed from Me! Destruction to them, for they have rebelled against Me! Though I would redeem them, they speak lies against Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">They do not cry out to Me from their hearts when they wail upon their beds. They slash themselves for grain and new wine, but turn away from Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Although I trained and strengthened their arms, they plot evil against Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">They turn, but not to the Most High; they are like a faulty bow. Their leaders will fall by the sword for the cursing of their tongue; for this they will be ridiculed in the land of Egypt.</p>
