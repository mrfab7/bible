<chapter book="Job" number="17" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct, the grave is ready for me.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Surely there are mockers with me, and mine eye abideth in their provocation.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Give now a pledge, be surety for me with thyself; who is there that will strike hands with me?</verse>
  <verse number="4">For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He that denounceth his friends for a prey, even the eyes of his children shall fail.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He hath made me also a byword of the people; and I am become an open abhorring.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Yet shall the righteous hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But return ye, all of you, and come now: and I shall not find a wise man among you.</verse>
  <verse number="11">My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the droughts of my heart.</verse>
  <verse number="12">They change the night into a day: the fight, say they, is near unto the darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If I look for Sheol as mine house; if I have spread my couch in the darkness;</verse>
  <verse number="14">If I have said to corruption, Thou art my father; to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister;</verse>
  <verse number="15">Where then is my hope? and as for my hope, who shall see it?</verse>
  <verse number="16">It shall go down to the bars of Sheol, when once there is rest in the dust.</verse>
