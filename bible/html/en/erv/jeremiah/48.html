<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Of Moab. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Woe unto Nebo! for it is laid waste; Kiriathaim is put to shame, it is taken: Misgab is put to shame and broken down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The praise of Moab is no more; in Heshbon they have devised evil against her, Come, and let us cut her off from being a nation. Thou also, O Madmen, shalt be brought to silence; the sword shall pursue thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The sound of a cry from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be heard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For by the ascent of Luhith with continual weeping shall they go up; for in the going down of Horonaim they have heard the distress of the cry of destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For, because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou also shalt be taken: and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity, his priests and his princes together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape; the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed; as the LORD hath spoken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Give wings unto Moab, that she may fly and get her away: and her cities shall become a desolation, without any to dwell therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Cursed be he that doeth the work of the LORD negligently, and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remaineth in him, and his scent is not changed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will send unto him them that pour off, and they shall pour him off; and they shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles in pieces.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Beth-el their confidence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">How say ye, We are mighty men, and valiant men for the war?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Moab is laid waste, and they are gone up into her cities; and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hasteth fast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">All ye that are round about him, bemoan him, and all ye that know his name; say, How is the strong staff broken, the beautiful rod!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">O thou daughter that dwellest in Dibon, come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab is come up against thee, he hath destroyed thy strong holds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way, and espy: ask him that fleeth, and her that escapeth; say, What hath been done?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Moab is put to shame; for it is broken down: howl and cry; tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahzah, and upon Mephaath;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">and upon Kiriathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon Beth-meon;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, far or near.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Make ye him drunken; for he magnified himself against the LORD: and Moab shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For was not Israel a derision unto thee? was he found among thieves? for as often as thou speakest of him, thou waggest the head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">O ye inhabitants of Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock; and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the holes mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">We have heard of the pride of Moab, that he is very proud; his loftiness, and his pride, and his arrogancy, and the haughtiness of his heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">I know his wrath, saith the LORD, that it is nought; his boastings have wrought nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Therefore will I howl for Moab; yea, I will cry out for all Moab: for the men of Kir-heres shall they mourn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">With more than the weeping of Jazer will I weep for thee, O vine of Sibmah: thy branches passed over the sea, they reached even to the sea of Jazer: upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage the spoiler is fallen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And gladness and joy is taken away, from the fruitful field and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to cease from the winepresses: none shall tread with shouting; the shouting shall be no shouting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">From the cry of Heshbon even unto Elealeh, even unto Jahaz have they uttered their voice, from Zoar even unto Horonaim, to Eglath-shelishiyah: for the waters of Nimrim also shall become desolate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the LORD, him that offereth in the high place, and him that burneth incense to his gods.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Therefore mine heart soundeth for Moab like pipes, and mine heart soundeth like pipes for the men of Kir-heres: therefore the abundance that he hath gotten is perished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">For every head is bald, and every beard clipped: upon all the hands are cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">On all the housetops of Moab and in the streets thereof there is lamentation every where: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">How is it broken down! how do they howl! how hath Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab become a derision and a dismaying to all that are round about him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">For thus saith the LORD: Behold, he shall fly as an eagle, and shall spread out his wings against Moab.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Kerioth is taken, and the strong holds are surprised, and the heart of the mighty men of Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath magnified himself against the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon her, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">They that fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon: for a fire is gone forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and hath devoured the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">Woe unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh is undone: for thy sons are taken away captive, and thy daughters into captivity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.</p>
