<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, forget not my law; but let your heart keep my commandments:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Let not mercy and truth forsake you: bind them about your neck; write them on the table of your heart:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">So shall you find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Trust in the LORD with all your heart; and lean not to your own understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In all your ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct your paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Be not wise in your own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">It shall be health to your navel, and marrow to your bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Honor the LORD with your substance, and with the first fruits of all your increase:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">So shall your barns be filled with plenty, and your presses shall burst out with new wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For whom the LORD loves he corrects; even as a father the son in whom he delights.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Happy is the man that finds wisdom, and the man that gets understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">She is more precious than rubies: and all the things you can desire are not to be compared to her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her: and happy is every one that retains her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The LORD by wisdom has founded the earth; by understanding has he established the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">My son, let not them depart from your eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">So shall they be life to your soul, and grace to your neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Then shall you walk in your way safely, and your foot shall not stumble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">When you lie down, you shall not be afraid: yes, you shall lie down, and your sleep shall be sweet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it comes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For the LORD shall be your confidence, and shall keep your foot from being taken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of your hand to do it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Say not to your neighbor, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when you have it by you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Devise not evil against your neighbor, seeing he dwells securely by you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done you no harm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Envy you not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For the fraudulent is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesses the habitation of the just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Surely he scorns the scorners: but he gives grace to the lowly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.</p>
