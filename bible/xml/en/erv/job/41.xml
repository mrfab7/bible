<chapter book="Job" number="41" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fish hook? or press down his tongue with a cord?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Canst thou put a rope into his nose? or pierce his jaw through with a hook?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Will he make many supplications unto thee? or will he speak soft words unto thee?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Will he make a covenant with thee, that thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Shall the bands of fishermen make traffic of him? shall they part him among the merchants?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons, or his head with fish spears?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Lay thine hand upon him; remember the battle, and do so no more.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?</verse>
  <verse number="10">None is so fierce that he dare stir him up: who then is he that can stand before me?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, nor his mighty strength, nor his comely proportion.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who can strip off his outer garment? who shall come within his double bridle?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Who can open the doors of his face? round about his teeth is terror.</verse>
  <verse number="15">His strong scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.</verse>
  <verse number="16">One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They are joined one to another; they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.</verse>
  <verse number="18">His neesings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Out of his mouth go burning torches, and sparks of fire leap forth.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Out of his nostrils a smoke goeth, as of a seething pot and burning rushes.</verse>
  <verse number="21">His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth forth from his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="22">In his neck abideth strength, and terror danceth before him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm upon him; they cannot be moved.</verse>
  <verse number="24">His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, firm as the nether millstone.</verse>
  <verse number="25">When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: by reason of consternation they are beside themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="26">If one lay at him with the sword, it cannot avail; nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.</verse>
  <verse number="27">He counteth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Clubs are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the rushing of the javelin.</verse>
  <verse number="30">His underparts are like sharp potsherds: he spreadeth as it were a threshing wain upon the mire.</verse>
  <verse number="31">He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like ointment.</verse>
  <verse number="32">He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Upon earth there is not his like, that is made without fear.</verse>
  <verse number="34">He beholdeth every thing that is high: he is king over all the sons of pride.</verse>
