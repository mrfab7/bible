<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="29" data-translation="King James Bible" data-translation-id="kjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Oh that I were as [in] months past, as [in] the days [when] God preserved me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">When his candle shined upon my head, [and when] by his light I walked [through] darkness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God [was] upon my tabernacle;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">When the Almighty [was] yet with me, [when] my children [were] about me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When I went out to the gate through the city, [when] I prepared my seat in the street!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, [and] stood up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The princes refrained talking, and laid [their] hand on their mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">When the ear heard [me], then it blessed me; and when the eye saw [me], it gave witness to me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and [him that had] none to help him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widowâ€™s heart to sing for joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment [was] as a robe and a diadem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I was eyes to the blind, and feet [was] I to the lame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I [was] a father to the poor: and the cause [which] I knew not I searched out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply [my] days as the sand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">My root [was] spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My glory [was] fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Unto me [men] gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide [as] for the latter rain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">[If] I laughed on them, they believed [it] not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one [that] comforteth the mourners.</p>
