  <verse number="1">I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:</verse>

  <verse number="3">Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who have for my life laid down their own necks: unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Likewise [greet] the church that is in their house. Salute my wellbeloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellowprisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved.</verse>

  <verse number="17">Now I beseech you, brethren, mark them which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned; and avoid them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For your obedience is come abroad unto all [men]. I am glad therefore on your behalf: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil.</verse>

  <verse number="24">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,</verse>
  <verse number="26">But now is made manifest, and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the everlasting God, made known to all nations for the obedience of faith:</verse>
  <verse number="27">To God only wise, [be] glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.</verse>
