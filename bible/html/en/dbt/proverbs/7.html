<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="7" data-translation="Darby Bible Translation" data-translation-id="dbt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Keep my commandments, and live; and my teaching, as the apple of thine eye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the tablet of thy heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister, and call intelligence [thy] kinswoman:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">that they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger who flattereth with her words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For at the window of my house, I looked forth through my lattice,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the sons, a young man void of understanding,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the blackness of night and the darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And behold, there met him a woman in the attire of a harlot, and subtle of heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">She is clamorous and unmanageable; her feet abide not in her house:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">now without, now in the broadways,â€”and she lieth in wait at every corner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And she caught him and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I have peace-offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">therefore came I forth to meet thee, to seek earnestly thy face, and I have found thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I have decked my bed with tapestry coverlets of variegated linen from Egypt;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I have perfumed my couch with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Come, let us revel in love until the morning, let us delight ourselves with loves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For the husband is not at home, he is gone a long journey;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">he hath taken the money-bag with him, he will come home on the day of the full moon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">With her much enticement she beguiled him; with the smoothness of her lips she constrained him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He went after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, and as stocks [serve] for the correction of the fool;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">till an arrow strike through his liver: as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for its life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And now, ye sons, hearken unto me, and attend to the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Let not thy heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">for she hath cast down many wounded, and all slain by her were strong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.</p>
