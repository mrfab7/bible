  <verse number="1">In the freedom, then, with which Christ did make you free—stand ye, and be not held fast again by a yoke of servitude;</verse>
  <verse number="2">lo, I Paul do say to you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and I testify again to every man circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law;</verse>
  <verse number="4">ye were freed from the Christ, ye who in law are declared righteous; from the grace ye fell away;</verse>
  <verse number="5">for we by the Spirit, by faith, a hope of righteousness do wait for,</verse>
  <verse number="6">for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but faith through love working.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Ye were running well; who did hinder you—not to obey the truth?</verse>
  <verse number="8">the obedience is not of him who is calling you!</verse>
  <verse number="9">a little leaven the whole lump doth leaven;</verse>
  <verse number="10">I have confidence in regard to you in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded; and he who is troubling you shall bear the judgment, whoever he may be.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And I, brethren, if uncircumcision I yet preach, why yet am I persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away;</verse>
  <verse number="12">O that even they would cut themselves off who are unsettling you!</verse>
  <verse number="13">For ye—to freedom ye were called, brethren, only not the freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through the love serve ye one another,</verse>
  <verse number="14">for all the law in one word is fulfilled—in this: ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;’</verse>
  <verse number="15">and if one another ye do bite and devour, see—that ye may not by one another be consumed.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And I say: In the Spirit walk ye, and the desire of the flesh ye may not complete;</verse>
  <verse number="17">for the flesh doth desire contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit contrary to the flesh, and these are opposed one to another, that the things that ye may will—these ye may not do;</verse>
  <verse number="18">and if by the Spirit ye are led, ye are not under law.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And manifest also are the works of the flesh, which are: Adultery, whoredom, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</verse>
  <verse number="20">idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, strifes, emulations, wraths, rivalries, dissensions, sects,</verse>
  <verse number="21">envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revellings, and such like, of which I tell you before, as I also said before, that those doing such things the reign of God shall not inherit.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the fruit of the Spirit is: Love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faith,</verse>
  <verse number="23">meekness, temperance: against such there is no law;</verse>
  <verse number="24">and those who are Christ’s, the flesh did crucify with the affections, and the desires;</verse>
  <verse number="25">if we may live in the Spirit, in the Spirit also we may walk;</verse>
  <verse number="26">let us not become vain-glorious—one another provoking, one another envying!</verse>
