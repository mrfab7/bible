<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Adam knew Life, his wife, and she will conceive and bear Cain, and said, I obtained a man of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And she will add to bear his brother Abel; and Abel shall be a feeder of sheep, and Cain was a laborer of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And it shall be at the end of days, and Cain shall bring in from the fruit of the earth an offering to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Abel, he also brought in the first-born of his sheep, and their fat. And Jehovah will look to Abel and to his gift.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And to Cain and to his offering he looked not: and Cain will be very angry, and his countenance will fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Jehovah will say to Cain, Why art thou angry, and why does thy countenance fall?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If thou shalt do well thou shalt be lifted up; and if thou shalt not do well, sin lies at the entrance; and to thee his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Cain will speak to Abel his brother; and it shall be in their being in the field, Cain will rise up against Abel his brother, and will kill him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Jehovah will say to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? and he will say, I know not: am I my brother’s watcher?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he will say, What didst thou? the voice of thy brother’s bloods, crying out to me from the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And now cursed art thou, from the earth, which opened her mouth to take thy brother’s bloods from thy hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When thou shalt work the earth she shall not add to give her strength to thee. Wandering and fleeing shalt thou be in the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Cain will say to Jehovah, My sin is great, above bearing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Lo, thou didst drive me out this day from above the face of the earth, and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be wandering and fleeing in the earth; and it shall be, every one finding me will kill me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Jehovah will say to him, Therefore, every one killing Cain, he shall be avenged seven fold. And Jehovah will put a sign upon Cain, lest any finding him, smite him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Cain went out from the face of Jehovah, and dwelt in the land of Nod, eastward of Eden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Cain will know his wife, and she will conceive and bear Enoch: and he will be building a city, and will call the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And to Enoch shall be born Irad; and Irad begat Mehujael; and Mehujael begat Methusael; and Methusael begat Lamech.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Lamech shall take to him two women: the name of the one Adah, and the name of the second, Zillah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Adah will bear Jabal; he was the father of him remaining in the tent, and riches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And his brother’s name Jubal; he was father of all laying hold of the harp and pipe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Zillah, she also will bear Tubal Cain, sharpening every cutting instrument of brass and iron: and Tubal Cain’s sister was Naamah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Lamech will say his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, and give ear to my word: for I killed a man to my wound, and a son to my cutting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">If Cain shall be avenged seven fold, also Lamech seventy and seven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Adam will know his wife again, and she will bear a son, and she will call his name Seth: for God set me a second seed instead of Abel, for Cain slew him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And to Seth, to him also a son shall be born, and he will call his name Enos: then it was begun to call in the name of Jehovah.</p>
