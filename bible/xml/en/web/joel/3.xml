  <verse number="1">“For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,</verse>
  <verse number="2">I will gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; and I will execute judgment on them there for my people, and for my heritage, Israel, whom they have scattered among the nations. They have divided my land,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and have cast lots for my people, and have given a boy for a prostitute, and sold a girl for wine, that they may drink.</verse>
  <verse number="4">“Yes, and what are you to me, Tyre, and Sidon, and all the regions of Philistia? Will you repay me? And if you repay me, I will swiftly and speedily return your repayment on your own head.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Because you have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried my finest treasures into your temples,</verse>
  <verse number="6">and have sold the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem to the sons of the Greeks, that you may remove them far from their border.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Behold, I will stir them up out of the place where you have sold them, and will return your repayment on your own head;</verse>
  <verse number="8">and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah, and they will sell them to the men of Sheba, to a faraway nation, for Yahweh has spoken it.”</verse>
  <verse number="9">Proclaim this among the nations: “Prepare for war! Stir up the mighty men. Let all the warriors draw near. Let them come up.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Beat your plowshares into swords, and your pruning hooks into spears. Let the weak say, ‘I am strong.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations, and gather yourselves together.” Cause your mighty ones to come down there, Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="12">“Let the nations arouse themselves, and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the surrounding nations.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Put in the sickle; for the harvest is ripe. Come, tread, for the winepress is full, the vats overflow, for their wickedness is great.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of Yahweh is near, in the valley of decision.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars withdraw their shining.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Yahweh will roar from Zion, and thunder from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth will shake; but Yahweh will be a refuge to his people, and a stronghold to the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="17">“So you will know that I am Yahweh, your God, dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain. Then Jerusalem will be holy, and no strangers will pass through her any more.</verse>
  <verse number="18">It will happen in that day, that the mountains will drop down sweet wine, the hills will flow with milk, all the brooks of Judah will flow with waters, and a fountain will come forth from the house of Yahweh, and will water the valley of Shittim.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Egypt will be a desolation, and Edom will be a desolate wilderness, for the violence done to the children of Judah, because they have shed innocent blood in their land.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But Judah will be inhabited forever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.</verse>
  <verse number="21">I will cleanse their blood, that I have not cleansed: for Yahweh dwells in Zion.”</verse>
