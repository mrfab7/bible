<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="1" data-translation="Darby Bible Translation" data-translation-id="dbt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, [a] called apostle of Jesus Christ, by God’s will, and Sosthenes the brother,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">to the assembly of God which is in Corinth, to [those] sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both theirs and ours:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I thank my God always about you, in respect of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">that in everything ye have been enriched in him, in all word [of doctrine], and all knowledge,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">(according as the testimony of the Christ has been confirmed in you,)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">so that ye come short in no gift, awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">who shall also confirm you to [the] end, unimpeachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">God [is] faithful, by whom ye have been called into [the] fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Now I exhort you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all say the same thing, and that there be not among you divisions; but that ye be perfectly united in the same mind and in the same opinion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For it has been shewn to me concerning you, my brethren, by those of [the house of] Chloe, that there are strifes among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But I speak of this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Is the Christ divided? has Paul been crucified for you? or have ye been baptised unto the name of Paul?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I thank God that I have baptised none of you, unless Crispus and Gaius,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">that no one may say that I have baptised unto my own name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Yes, I baptised also the house of Stephanas; for the rest I know not if I have baptised any other.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For Christ has not sent me to baptise, but to preach glad tidings; not in wisdom of word, that the cross of the Christ may not be made vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For the word of the cross is to them that perish foolishness, but to us that are saved it is God’s power.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and set aside the understanding of the understanding ones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Where [is the] wise? where scribe? where disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For since, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom has not known God, God has been pleased by the foolishness of the preaching to save those that believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Since Jews indeed ask for signs, and Greeks seek wisdom;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews an offence, and to nations foolishness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">but to those that [are] called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ God’s power and God’s wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For consider your calling, brethren, that [there are] not many wise according to flesh, not many powerful, not many high-born.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">But God has chosen the foolish things of the world, that he may put to shame the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world, that he may put to shame the strong things;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">and the ignoble things of the world, and the despised, has God chosen, [and] things that are not, that he may annul the things that are;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">so that no flesh should boast before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who has been made to us wisdom from God, and righteousness, and holiness, and redemption;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">that according as it is written, He that boasts, let him boast in [the] Lord.</p>
