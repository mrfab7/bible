<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And there will remain among the sons of Israel to whom they distributed not their inheritance, seven tribes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Joshua will say to the sons of Israel, How long are ye slack to go to possess the land which Jehovah the God of your fathers gave to you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Give to you three men for a tribe, and I will send them, and they shall rise and shall go through the land, and they shall write it according to their inheritance, and they shall come to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And they divided it into seven portions: Judah shall stand upon his bound from the south, and the house of Joseph shall stand upon their bound from the north.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And ye shall write the land seven portions and bring to me hither, and I will cast the lot for you here before Jehovah our God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But not a portion to the Levites in the midst of you; for the priesthood of Jehovah their inheritance: and Gad and Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh took their inheritance from beyond Jordan from the sunrising, which Moses gave to them, the servant of Jehovah.</p>
