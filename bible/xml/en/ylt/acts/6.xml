  <verse number="1">And in these days, the disciples multiplying, there came a murmuring of the Hellenists at the Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily ministration,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and the twelve, having called near the multitude of the disciples, said, ‘It is not pleasing that we, having left the word of God, do minister at tables;</verse>
  <verse number="3">look out, therefore, brethren, seven men of you who are well testified of, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may set over this necessity,</verse>
  <verse number="4">and we to prayer, and to the ministration of the word, will give ourselves continually.’</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the thing was pleasing before all the multitude, and they did choose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch,</verse>
  <verse number="6">whom they did set before the apostles, and they, having prayed, laid on them their hands.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the word of God did increase, and the number of the disciples did multiply in Jerusalem exceedingly; a great multitude also of the priests were obedient to the faith.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Stephen, full of faith and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people,</verse>
  <verse number="9">and there arose certain of those of the synagogue, called of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia, and Asia, disputing with Stephen,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit with which he was speaking;</verse>
  <verse number="11">then they suborned men, saying—‘We have heard him speaking evil sayings in regard to Moses and God.’</verse>
  <verse number="12">They did stir up also the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and having come upon him, they caught him, and brought him to the sanhedrim;</verse>
  <verse number="13">they set up also false witnesses, saying, ‘This one doth not cease to speak evil sayings against this holy place and the law,</verse>
  <verse number="14">for we have heard him saying, That this Jesus the Nazarean shall overthrow this place, and shall change the customs that Moses delivered to us;’</verse>
  <verse number="15">and gazing at him, all those sitting in the sanhedrim saw his face as it were the face of a messenger.</verse>
