<p class="verse" data-verse="52">Then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">And you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">And you shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more you shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance: every man’s inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falls; according to the tribes of your fathers you shall inherit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">But if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which you let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein you dwell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do to you, as I thought to do to them.</p>
