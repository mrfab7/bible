<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Whoever has a will to withdraw from a friend, seeks occasions; he shall be reproached at all times.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The foolish do not accept words of prudence, unless you say what is already turning in his heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The impious, when he has arrived within the depths of sin, thinks little of it. But ill repute and disgrace follow him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Words from the mouth of a man are deep waters. And the fountain of wisdom is a torrent overflowing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">It is not good to accept the character of the impious, so as to turn away from true judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The lips of the foolish meddle in disputes. And his mouth provokes conflicts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The mouth of the foolish is his destruction, and his own lips are the ruin of his soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The words of the double-tongued seem simple. And they reach even to the interior of the gut. Fear casts down the lazy, but the souls of the effeminate shall go hungry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Whoever is dissolute and slack in his work is the brother of him who wastes his own works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The name of the Lord is very strong tower. The just one rushes to it, and he shall be exalted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The substance of the wealthy is the city of his strength, and it is like a strong wall encircling him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The heart of a man is exalted before it is crushed and humbled before it is glorified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whoever responds before he listens, demonstrates himself to be foolish and deserving of confusion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The spirit of a man sustains his weakness. Yet who can sustain a spirit that is easily angered?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">A prudent heart shall possess knowledge. And the ear of the wise seeks doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A man’s gift expands his way and makes space for him before leaders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The just is the first accuser of himself; his friend arrives and shall investigate him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Casting a lot suppresses contentions and passes judgment, even among the powerful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A brother who is helped by a brother is like a reinforced city, and judgments are like the bars of cities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">From the fruit of a man’s mouth shall his belly be filled. And the harvest of his own lips shall satisfy him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Death and life are in the power of the tongue. Whoever values it shall eat from its fruits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He who has found a good wife has found goodness, and he shall draw contentment from the Lord. He who expels a good wife expels goodness. But he who holds on to an adulteress is foolish and impious.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The poor will speak with supplications. And the rich will express themselves roughly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">A man amiable to society shall be more friendly than a brother.</p>
