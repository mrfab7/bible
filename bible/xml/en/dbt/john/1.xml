<chapter book="John" number="1" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">In [the] beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He was in the beginning with God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">All things received being through him, and without him not one [thing] received being which has received being.</verse>
  <verse number="4">In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the light appears in darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not.</verse>
  <verse number="6">There was a man sent from God, his name John.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He came for witness, that he might witness concerning the light, that all might believe through him.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He was not the light, but that he might witness concerning the light.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The true light was that which, coming into the world, lightens every man.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He was in the world, and the world had [its] being through him, and the world knew him not.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He came to his own, and his own received him not;</verse>
  <verse number="12">but as many as received him, to them gave he [the] right to be children of God, to those that believe on his name;</verse>
  <verse number="13">who have been born, not of blood, nor of flesh’s will, nor of man’s will, but of God.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we have contemplated his glory, a glory as of an only-begotten with a father), full of grace and truth;</verse>
  <verse number="15">(John bears witness of him, and he has cried, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that comes after me is preferred before me, for he was before me;)</verse>
  <verse number="16">for of his fulness we all have received, and grace upon grace.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For the law was given by Moses: grace and truth subsists through Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="18">No one has seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared [him].</verse>
  <verse number="19">And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent from Jerusalem priests and Levites that they might ask him, Thou, who art thou?</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he acknowledged and denied not, and acknowledged, I am not the Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he says, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.</verse>
  <verse number="22">They said therefore to him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</verse>
  <verse number="23">He said, I [am] [the] voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the path of [the] Lord, as said Esaias the prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And they were sent from among the Pharisees.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And they asked him and said to him, Why baptisest thou then, if thou art not the Christ, nor Elias, nor the prophet?</verse>
  <verse number="26">John answered them saying, I baptise with water. In the midst of you stands, whom ye do not know,</verse>
  <verse number="27">he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to unloose.</verse>
  <verse number="28">These things took place in Bethany, across the Jordan, where John was baptising.</verse>
  <verse number="29">On the morrow he sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="30">He it is of whom I said, A man comes after me who takes a place before me, because he was before me;</verse>
  <verse number="31">and I knew him not; but that he might be manifested to Israel, therefore have I come baptising with water.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And John bore witness, saying, I beheld the Spirit descending as a dove from heaven, and it abode upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And I knew him not; but he who sent me to baptise with water, he said to me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, he it is who baptises with [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And I have seen and borne witness that this is the Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Again, on the morrow, there stood John and two of his disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And, looking at Jesus as he walked, he says, Behold the Lamb of God.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And the two disciples heard him speaking, and followed Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="38">But Jesus having turned, and seeing them following, says to them, What seek ye? And they said to him, Rabbi (which, being interpreted, signifies Teacher), where abidest thou?</verse>
  <verse number="39">He says to them, Come and see. They went therefore, and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.</verse>
  <verse number="40">Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard [this] from John and followed him.</verse>
  <verse number="41">He first finds his own brother Simon, and says to him, We have found the Messias (which being interpreted is Christ).</verse>
  <verse number="42">And he led him to Jesus. Jesus looking at him said, Thou art Simon, the son of Jonas; thou shalt be called Cephas (which interpreted is stone).</verse>
  <verse number="43">On the morrow he would go forth into Galilee, and Jesus finds Philip, and says to him, Follow me.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Philip finds Nathanael, and says to him, We have found him of whom Moses wrote in the law, and the prophets, Jesus, the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And Nathanael said to him, Can anything good come out of Nazareth? Philip says to him, Come and see.</verse>
  <verse number="47">Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and says of him, Behold [one] truly an Israelite, in whom there is no guile.</verse>
  <verse number="48">Nathanael says to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said to him, Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.</verse>
  <verse number="49">Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="50">Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Thou shalt see greater things than these.</verse>
  <verse number="51">And he says to him, Verily, verily, I say to you, Henceforth ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man.</verse>
