<chapter book="Isaiah" number="48" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Hear you this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah, which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves on the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they went forth out of my mouth, and I showed them; I did them suddenly, and they came to pass.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Because I knew that you are obstinate, and your neck is an iron sinew, and your brow brass;</verse>
  <verse number="5">I have even from the beginning declared it to you; before it came to pass I showed it you: lest you should say, My idol has done them, and my graven image, and my molten image, has commanded them.</verse>
  <verse number="6">You have heard, see all this; and will not you declare it? I have showed you new things from this time, even hidden things, and you did not know them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when you heard them not; lest you should say, Behold, I knew them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Yes, you heard not; yes, you knew not; yes, from that time that your ear was not opened: for I knew that you would deal very treacherously, and were called a transgressor from the womb.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For my name’s sake will I defer my anger, and for my praise will I refrain for you, that I cut you not off.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Behold, I have refined you, but not with silver; I have chosen you in the furnace of affliction.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For my own sake, even for my own sake, will I do it: for how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory to another.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Listen to me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.</verse>
  <verse number="13">My hand also has laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand has spanned the heavens: when I call to them, they stand up together.</verse>
  <verse number="14">All you, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them has declared these things? The LORD has loved him: he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I, even I, have spoken; yes, I have called him: I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Come you near to me, hear you this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, has sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Thus said the LORD, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I am the LORD your God which teaches you to profit, which leads you by the way that you should go.</verse>
  <verse number="18">O that you had listened to my commandments! then had your peace been as a river, and your righteousness as the waves of the sea:</verse>
  <verse number="19">Your seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of your bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Go you forth of Babylon, flee you from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare you, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say you, The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he split the rock also, and the waters gushed out.</verse>
  <verse number="22">There is no peace, said the LORD, to the wicked.</verse>
