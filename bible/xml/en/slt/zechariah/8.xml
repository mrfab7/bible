  <verse number="1">And the word of Jehovah of armies will be, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thus said Jehovah of armies: I was jealous for Zion with great jealousy and with great wrath was I jealous for her.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thus said Jehovah: I turned back to Zion, and I dwelt in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem was called, The city of truth; and the mountain of Jehovah of armies, The holy mountain.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thus said Jehovah of armies: Yet shall old men and old women sit in the broad places of Jerusalem, and a man his support in his hand from the multitude of days.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the broad places of the city shall be filled with boys and girls playing in her broad places.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Thus said Jehovah of armies: If it shall be wonderful in the eyes of the remnant of this people in these days, also shall it be wonderful in mine eyes, says Jehovah of armies:</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thus said Jehovah of armies: Behold me saving my people from the land of the sun rising, and from the land of the going down of the sun.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And I brought them, and they dwelt in the midst of Jerusalem: and they were to me for a people, and I will be to them for God, in truth and in justice.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Thus said Jehovah of armies: Your hands shall be strong, ye bearing in these days these words from the mouth of the prophets, which were in the day the house of Jehovah of armies was founded for the temple to be built.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For before these days there was no hire of man, and not any hire of cattle; and to him going out, and to him coming in, no peace from the straits: and I will send all the men each against his neighbor.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And now not as the former days am I to the remnant of this people, says Jehovah of armies.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For the seed of peace; the vine shall give her fruit and the earth shall give her produce, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I caused the remnant of this people to inherit all these.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And it was as ye were a curse in the nations, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so I will save you, and ye were a praise: ye shall not fear; your hands shall be strengthened.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For thus said Jehovah of armies; As I had in mind to do evil to you in your fathers provoking me to anger, said Jehovah of armies, and, I lamented not.</verse>
  <verse number="15">So I turned back; I had in mind in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: ye shall not fear.</verse>
  <verse number="16">These the words which ye shall do: speak the truth each with his neighbor; truth and the judgment of peace judge ye in your gates.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And ye shall not purpose evil, a man to his neighbor, in your heart; and ye shall not love the oath of falsehood: for all these which I hated, says Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the word of Jehovah of armies will be to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="19">Thus said Jehovah of armies: The fast of the fourth, and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah for joy and for gladness, and for good appointments; and love ye truth and peace.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Thus said Jehovah of armies: Yet that peoples shall come, and the inhabitants of many cities:</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the inhabitants of one went to one, saying, We will go, going to beseech the face of Jehovah, and to seek Jehovah of armies: I will go also.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And many peoples and strong nations came to seek Jehovah of armies in Jerusalem, and to beseech the face of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Thus said Jehovah of armies: In those days, that ten men shall take hold from all tongues of the nations, and they took hold of the wing of a man a Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we heard God is with you.</verse>
