  <verse number="1">The elder, To the beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Beloved, I pray that in every way you may prosper and enjoy good health, as your soul also prospers.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For I was overjoyed when the brothers came and testified about your devotion to the truth, in which you continue to walk.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Beloved, you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers, and especially since they are strangers to you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">They have testified to the church about your love. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For they went out on behalf of the Name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Therefore we ought to support such men, so that we may be fellow workers for the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I have written to the church about this, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first, will not accept our instruction.</verse>
  <verse number="10">So if I come, I will call attention to his malicious slander against us. And unsatisfied with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers and forbids those who want to do so, even putting them out of the church.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The one who does good is of God; the one who does evil has not seen God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself. We also testify for him, and you know that our testimony is true.</verse>
  <verse number="13">I have many things to write to you, but I would prefer not to do so with pen and ink.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Instead, I hope to see you soon and speak with you face to face. Peace to you. The friends here send you greetings. Greet each of our friends there by name.</verse>
