1	And saying, Hear now, ye heads of Jacob, and ye judges of the house of Israel: Is it not for you to know judgment?
2	Hating the good and loving the evil; plucking off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones.
3	And who ate the flesh of my people, and they stripped off their skin from off them; and they brake their bones in pieces, and separated as for the pot, and as flesh in the midst of the kettle.
4	Then shall they cry to Jehovah and he will not answer them, and he will hide his face from them in that time, as their doings were evil.
5	Thus said Jehovah for the prophets causing my people to wander, and biting with their teeth, and they called, Peace; and who will not give upon their mouth and they consecrated war against him:
6	For this, night to you from a vision, and darkness to you from divining; and the sun went down upon the prophets, and the day was dark upon them.
7	And they seeing were ashamed, and they divining were disgraced, and they covered over their lip, all of them; for no answer of God.
8	But I was filled with power, with the spirit of Jehovah, and judgment and strength to announce to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.
9	Hear now this, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and judges of the house of Israel abhorring judgment, and they will pervert all uprightness.
10	Building Zion with bloods and Jerusalem with iniquity.
11	Her heads will judge for a gift, and her priests will teach for hire, and her prophets will divine for silver: and they will lean upon Jehovah, saying, Is not Jehovah in the midst of us? he will not bring evil upon us.
12	For this, on account of you Zion shall be ploughed a field, and Jerusalem shall be ruins, and the mountain of the house for the heights of the forest.
