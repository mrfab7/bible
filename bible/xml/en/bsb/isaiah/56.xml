<chapter book="Isaiah" number="56" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">This is what the LORD says: “Maintain justice and do what is right, for My salvation is coming soon, and My righteousness will be revealed.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who holds it fast, who keeps the Sabbath without profaning it and keeps his hand from doing any evil.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">Let no foreigner who has joined himself to the LORD say, “The LORD will utterly exclude me from His people.” And let the eunuch not say, “I am but a dry tree.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">For this is what the LORD says: “To the eunuchs who keep My Sabbaths, who choose what pleases Me and hold fast to My covenant—</verse>
  <verse number="5">I will give them, in My house and within My walls, a memorial and a name better than that of sons and daughters. I will give them an everlasting name that will not be cut off.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the foreigners who join themselves to the LORD to minister to Him, to love the name of the LORD, and to be His servants—all who keep the Sabbath without profaning it and who hold fast to My covenant—</verse>
  <verse number="7">I will bring them to My holy mountain and make them joyful in My house of prayer. Their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on My altar, for My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thus declares the Lord GOD, who gathers the dispersed of Israel: “I will gather to them still others besides those already gathered.”</verse>
  <verse number="9">Come, all you beasts of the field; eat greedily, all you beasts of the forest.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Israel’s watchmen are blind, they are all oblivious; they are all mute dogs, they cannot bark; they are dreamers lying around, loving to slumber.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Like ravenous dogs, they are never satisfied. They are shepherds with no discernment; they all turn to their own way, each one seeking his own gain:</verse>
  <verse number="12">“Come, let me get the wine, let us imbibe the strong drink, and tomorrow will be like today, only far better!”</verse>
