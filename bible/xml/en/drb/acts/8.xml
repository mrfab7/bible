  <verse number="1">AND at that time there was raised a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all dispersed through the countries of Judea, and Samaria, except the apostles.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And devout men took order for Stephen’s funeral, and made great mourning over him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But Saul made havock of the church, entering in from house to house, and dragging away men and women, committed them to prison.</verse>
  <verse number="4">They therefore that were dispersed, went about preaching the word of God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Philip going down to the city of Samaria, preached Christ unto them.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the people with one accord were attentive to those things which were said by Philip, hearing, and seeing the miracles which he did.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For many of them who had unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, went out.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And many, taken with the palsy, and that were lame, were healed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">There was therefore great joy in that city. Now there was a certain man named Simon, who before had been a magician in that city, seducing the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great one:</verse>
  <verse number="10">To whom they all gave ear, from the least to the greatest, saying: This man is the power of God, which is called great.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And they were attentive to him, because, for a long time, he had bewitched them with his magical practices.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But when they had believed Philip preaching of the kingdom of God, in the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then Simon himself believed also; and being baptized, he adhered to Philip. And being astonished, wondered to see the signs and exceeding great miracles which were done.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Now when the apostles, who were in Jerusalem, had heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Who, when they were come, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For he was not as yet come upon any of them; but they were only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Then they laid their hands upon them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And when Simon saw, that by the imposition of the hands of the apostles, the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</verse>
  <verse number="19">Saying: Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I shall lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. But Peter said to him:</verse>
  <verse number="20">Keep thy money to thyself, to perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Thou hast no part nor lot in this matter. For thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Do penance therefore for this thy wickedness; and pray to God, that perhaps this thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For I see thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then Simon answering, said: Pray you for me to the Lord, that none of these things which you have spoken may come upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And they indeed having testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many countries of the Samaritans.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying: Arise, go towards the south, to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem into Gaza: this is desert.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And rising up, he went. And behold a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch, of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge over all her treasures, had come to Jerusalem to adore.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And he was returning, sitting in this chariot, and reading Isaias the prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And the Spirit said to Philip: Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And Philip running thither, heard him reading the prophet Isaias. And he said: Thinkest thou that thou understandest what thou readest?</verse>
  <verse number="31">Who said: And how can I, unless some man shew me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And the place of the scripture which he was reading was this: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb without voice before his shearer, so openeth he not his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="33">In humility his judgment was taken away. His generation who shall declare, for his life shall be taken from the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="34">And the eunuch answering Philip, said: I beseech thee, of whom doth the prophet speak this? of himself, or of some other man?</verse>
  <verse number="35">Then Philip, opening his mouth, and beginning at this scripture, preached unto him Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water; and the eunuch said: See, here is water: what doth hinder me from being baptized?</verse>
  <verse number="37">And Philip said: If thou believest with all thy heart, thou mayest. And he answering, said: I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And he commanded the chariot to stand still; and they went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch: and he baptized him.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more. And he went on his way rejoicing.</verse>
  <verse number="40">But Philip was found in Azotus; and passing through, he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</verse>
