  <verse number="1">So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent, which David had pitched for it : and they offered holocausts, and peace offerings before God.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And when David had made an end of offering holocausts, and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he divided to all and every one, both men and women, a loaf of bread, and a piece of roasted beef, and flour fried with oil.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he appointed Levites to minister before the ark of the Lord, and to remember his works, and to glorify, and praise the Lord God of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Asaph the chief, and next after him Zacharias: moreover Jahiel, and Semiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mathathias, and Eliab, and Banaias, and Obededom: and Jehiel over the instruments of psaltery, and harps: and Asaph sounded with cymbals:</verse>
  <verse number="6">But Banaias, and Jaziel the priests, to sound the trumpet continually before the ark of the covenant of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="7">In that day David made Asaph the chief to give praise to the Lord with his brethren.</verse>

  <verse number="17">And he appointed the same to Jacob for a precept: and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:</verse>
  <verse number="18">Saying: To thee will I give the land of Chanaan: the lot of your inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="19">When they were but a small number: very few and sojourners in it.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And they passed from nation to nation: and from a kingdom to another people.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He suffered no man to do them wrong: and reproved kings for their sake.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Touch not my anointed: and do no evil to my prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Sing ye to the Lord, all the earth: shew forth from day to day his salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Declare his glory among the Gentiles: his wonders among all people.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For the Lord is great and exceedingly to be praised: and he is to be feared above all gods.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the Lord made the heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Praise and magnificence are before him: strength and joy in his place.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Bring ye to the Lord, O ye families of the nations: bring ye to the Lord glory and empire.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Give to the Lord glory to his name, bring up sacrifice, and come ye in his sight: and adore the Lord in holy becomingness.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Let all the earth be moved at his presence : for he hath founded the world immoveable.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth be glad: and let them say among the nations: The Lord hath reigned.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all things that are in them.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Then shall the trees of the wood give praise before the Lord: because he is come to judge the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Give ye glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And say ye: Save us, O God our saviour: and gather us together, and deliver us from the nations, that we may give glory to thy holy name, and may rejoice in singing thy praises.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from eternity to eternity: and let all the people say Amen, and a hymn to God.</verse>

  <verse number="42">And Heman and Idithun sounded the trumpet, and played on the cymbals, and all kinds of musical instruments to sing praises to God: and the sons of Idithun he made porters.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And all the people returned to their houses: and David to bless also his own house.</verse>
