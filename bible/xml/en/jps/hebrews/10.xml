<chapter book="Hebrews" number="10" translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" translationID="jps" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">For, since the Law exhibits only an outline of the blessings to come and not a perfect representation of the things themselves, the priests can never, by repeating the same sacrifices which they continually offer year after year, give complete freedom from sin to those who draw near.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For then would not the sacrifices have ceased to be offered, because the consciences of the worshippers—who in that case would now have been cleansed once for all—would no longer be burdened with sins?</verse>
  <verse number="3">But in those sacrifices sins are recalled to memory year after year.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</verse>
  <verse number="5">That is why, when He comes into the world, He says, “Sacrifice and offering Thou has not desired, but a body Thou hast prepared for Me.</verse>
  <verse number="6">In whole burnt-offerings and in sin-offerings Thou hast taken no pleasure.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then I said, ‘I have come—in the roll of the book it is written concerning Me—to do Thy will, O God.’”</verse>
  <verse number="8">After saying the words I have just quoted, “Sacrifices and offerings or whole burnt-offerings and sin-offerings Thou hast not desired or taken pleasure in”—all such being offered in obedience to the Law—</verse>
  <verse number="9">He then adds, “I have come to do Thy will.” He does away with the first in order to establish the second.</verse>
  <verse number="10">It is through that divine will that we have been set free from sin, through the offering of Jesus Christ as our sacrifice once for all.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And while every priest stands ministering, day after day, and constantly offering the same sacrifices—though such can never rid us of our sins—</verse>
  <verse number="12">this Priest, on the contrary, after offering for sins a single sacrifice of perpetual efficacy, took His seat at God’s right hand,</verse>
  <verse number="13">waiting from that time onward until His enemies be put as a footstool under His feet.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For by a single offering He has for ever completed the blessing for those whom He is setting free from sin.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the Holy Spirit also gives us His testimony; for when He had said,</verse>
  <verse number="16">“’This is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days,’ says the Lord: ‘I will put My laws upon their hearts and will write them on their minds;’”</verse>
  <verse number="17">He adds, “And their sins and offences I will remember no longer.”</verse>
  <verse number="18">But where these have been forgiven no further offering for sin is required.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Since then, brethren, we have free access to the Holy place through the blood of Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="20">by the new and ever-living way which He opened up for us through the rending of the veil—that is to say, of His earthly nature—</verse>
  <verse number="21">and since we have a great Priest who has authority over the house of God,</verse>
  <verse number="22">let us draw near with sincerity and unfaltering faith, having had our hearts sprinkled, once for all, from consciences oppressed with sin, and our bodies bathed in pure water.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Let us hold firmly to an unflinching avowal of our hope, for He is faithful who gave us the promises.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And let us bestow thought on one another with a view to arousing one another to brotherly love and right conduct;</verse>
  <verse number="25">not neglecting—as some habitually do—to meet together, but encouraging one another, and doing this all the more since you can see the day of Christ approaching.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For if we wilfully persist in sin after having received the full knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains in reserve any other sacrifice for sins.</verse>
  <verse number="27">There remains nothing but a certain awful expectation of judgement, and the fury of a fire which before long will devour the enemies of the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Any one who bids defiance to the Law of Moses is put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</verse>
  <verse number="29">How much severer punishment, think you, will he be held to deserve who has trampled under foot the Son of God, has not regarded as holy that Covenant-blood with which he was set free from sin, and has insulted the Spirit from whom comes grace?</verse>
  <verse number="30">For we know who it is that has said, “Vengeance belongs to Me: I will pay back;” and again, “The Lord will be His people’s judge.”</verse>
  <verse number="31">It is an awful thing to fall into the hands of the ever-living God.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But continually recall to mind the days now past, when on being first enlightened you went through a great conflict and many sufferings.</verse>
  <verse number="33">This was partly through allowing yourselves to be made a public spectacle amid reproaches and persecutions, and partly through coming forward to share the sufferings of those who were thus treated.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For you not only showed sympathy with those who were imprisoned, but you even submitted with joy when your property was taken from you, being well aware that you have in your own selves a more valuable possession and one which will remain.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Therefore do not cast from you your confident hope, for it will receive a vast reward.</verse>
  <verse number="36">For you stand in need of patient endurance, so that, as the result of having done the will of God, you may receive the promised blessing.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For there is still but a short time and then “The coming One will come and will not delay.</verse>
  <verse number="38">But it is by faith that My righteous servant shall live; and if he shrinks back, My soul takes no pleasure in him.”</verse>
  <verse number="39">But we are not people who shrink back and perish, but are among those who believe and gain possession of their souls.</verse>
