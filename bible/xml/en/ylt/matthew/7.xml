  <verse number="1">‘Judge not, that ye may not be judged,</verse>
  <verse number="2">for in what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged, and in what measure ye measure, it shall be measured to you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And why dost thou behold the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, and the beam that is in thine own eye dost not consider?</verse>
  <verse number="4">or, how wilt thou say to thy brother, Suffer I may cast out the mote from thine eye, and lo, the beam is in thine own eye?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then thou shalt see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Ye may not give that which is holy to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before the swine, that they may not trample them among their feet, and having turned—may rend you.</verse>
  <verse number="7">‘Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you;</verse>
  <verse number="8">for every one who is asking doth receive, and he who is seeking doth find, and to him who is knocking it shall be opened.</verse>
  <verse number="9">‘Or what man is of you, of whom, if his son may ask a loaf—a stone will he present to him?</verse>
  <verse number="10">and if a fish he may ask—a serpent will he present to him?</verse>
  <verse number="11">if, therefore, ye being evil, have known good gifts to give to your children, how much more shall your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those asking him?</verse>
  <verse number="12">‘All things, therefore, whatever ye may will that men may be doing to you, so also do to them, for this is the law and the prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Go ye in through the strait gate, because wide is the gate, and broad the way that is leading to the destruction, and many are those going in through it;</verse>
  <verse number="14">how strait is the gate, and compressed the way that is leading to the life, and few are those finding it!</verse>
  <verse number="15">‘But, take heed of the false prophets, who come unto you in sheep’s clothing, and inwardly are ravening wolves.</verse>
  <verse number="16">From their fruits ye shall know them; do men gather from thorns grapes? or from thistles figs?</verse>
  <verse number="17">so every good tree doth yield good fruits, but the bad tree doth yield evil fruits.</verse>
  <verse number="18">A good tree is not able to yield evil fruits, nor a bad tree to yield good fruits.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Every tree not yielding good fruit is cut down and is cast to fire:</verse>
  <verse number="20">therefore from their fruits ye shall know them.</verse>
  <verse number="21">‘Not every one who is saying to me Lord, lord, shall come into the reign of the heavens; but he who is doing the will of my Father who is in the heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Many will say to me in that day, Lord, lord, have we not in thy name prophesied? and in thy name cast out demons? and in thy name done many mighty things?</verse>
  <verse number="23">and then I will acknowledge to them, that—I never knew you, depart from me ye who are working lawlessness.</verse>
  <verse number="24">‘Therefore, every one who doth hear of me these words, and doth do them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house upon the rock;</verse>
  <verse number="25">and the rain did descend, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and they beat on that house, and it fell not, for it had been founded on the rock.</verse>
  <verse number="26">‘And every one who is hearing of me these words, and is not doing them, shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand;</verse>
  <verse number="27">and the rain did descend, and the streams came, and the winds blew, and they beat on that house, and it fell, and its fall was great.’</verse>
  <verse number="28">And it came to pass, when Jesus ended these words, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching,</verse>
  <verse number="29">for he was teaching them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</verse>
