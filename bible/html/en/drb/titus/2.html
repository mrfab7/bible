<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But speak thou the things that become sound doctrine:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">That the aged men be sober, chaste, prudent, sound in faith, in love, in patience.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The aged women, in like manner, in holy attire, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teaching well:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">That they may teach the young women to be wise, to love their husbands, to love their children,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">To be discreet, chaste, sober, having a care of the house, gentle, obedient to their husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Young men, in like manner, exhort that they be sober.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In all things shew thyself an example of good works, in doctrine, in integrity, in gravity,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The sound word that can not be blamed: that he, who is on the contrary part, may be afraid, having no evil to say of us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Exhort servants to be obedient to their masters, in all things pleasing, not gainsaying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Not defrauding, but in all things shewing good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the grace of God our Savior hath appeared to all men;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Instructing us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly, and justly, and godly in this world,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Looking for the blessed hope and coming of the glory of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and might cleanse to himself a people acceptable, a pursuer of good works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">These things speak, and exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</p>
