<chapter book="2 Timothy" number="4" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">I charge thee in the sight of God, and of Christ Jesus, who shall judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:</verse>
  <verse number="2">preach the word; be urgent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the time will come when they will not endure the sound doctrine; but, having itching ears, will heap to themselves teachers after their own lusts;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and will turn away their ears from the truth, and turn aside unto fables.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But be thou sober in all things, suffer hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For I am already being offered, and the time of my departure is come.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith:</verse>
  <verse number="8">henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all them that have loved his appearing.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Give diligence to come shortly unto me:</verse>
  <verse number="10">for Demas forsook me, having loved this present world, and went to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is useful to me for ministering.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But Tychicus I sent to Ephesus.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the parchments.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord will render to him according to his works:</verse>
  <verse number="15">of whom do thou also beware; for he greatly withstood our words.</verse>
  <verse number="16">At my first defence no one took my part, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their account.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me; that through me the message might be fully proclaimed, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Erastus remained at Corinth: but Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Give diligence to come before winter. Eubulus saluteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The Lord be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.</verse>
