<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee the finest and dearest oil of olives, to furnish the lamps continually,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Without the veil of the testimony in the tabernacle of the covenant. And Aaron shall set them from evening until morning before the Lord, by a perpetual service and rite in your generations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They shall be set upon the most pure candlestick before the Lord continually.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thou shalt take also fine hour, and shalt bake twelve leaves thereof, two tenths shall be in every loaf :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And thou shalt set them six and six one against another upon the most clean table before the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And thou shalt put upon them the dearest frankincense, that the bread may be for a memorial of the oblation of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Every sabbath they shall be changed before the Lord, being received of the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And they shall be Aaron’s and his sons’, that they may eat them in the holy place: because it is most holy of the sacrifices of the Lord by a perpetual right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And behold there went out the son of a woman of Israel, whom she had of an Egyptian, among the children of Israel, and fell at words in the camp with a man of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And when he had blasphemed the name, and had cursed it, he was brought to Moses: (now his mother was called Salumith, the daughter of Dabri, of the tribe of Dan:)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And they put him into prison, till they might know what the Lord would command.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the Lord spoke to Moses,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Saying: Bring forth the blasphemer without the camp, and let them that heard him, put their hands upon his head, and let all the people stone him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And thou shalt speak to the children of Israel: the man that curseth his God, shall bear his sin:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him die: all the multitude shall stone him, whether he be a native or a stranger. He that blasphemeth the name of the Lord, dying let him die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He that striketh and killeth a man, dying let him die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He that killeth a beast, shall make it good, that is to say, shall give beast for beast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He that giveth a blemish to any of his neighbours: as he hath done, so shall it be done to him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, shall he restore. What blemish he gave, the like shall he be compelled to suffer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He that striketh a beast, shall render another. He that striketh a man shall be punished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Let there be equal judgment among you, whether he be a stranger, or a native that offends: because I am the Lord your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Moses spoke to the children of Israel: and they brought forth him that had blasphemed, without the camp, and they stoned him. And the children of Israel did as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>
