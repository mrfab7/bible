<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Woe to you who destroy, but you weren’t destroyed; and who betray, but nobody betrayed you! When you have finished destroying, you will be destroyed; and when you have made an end of betrayal, you will be betrayed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Yahweh, be gracious to us. We have waited for you. Be our strength every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">At the noise of the thunder, the peoples have fled. When you lift yourself up, the nations are scattered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Your spoil will be gathered as the caterpillar gathers. Men will leap on it as locusts leap.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Yahweh is exalted, for he dwells on high. He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">There will be stability in your times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge. The fear of Yahweh is your treasure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, their valiant ones cry outside; the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The highways are desolate. The traveling man ceases. The covenant is broken. He has despised the cities. He doesn’t respect man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The land mourns and languishes. Lebanon is confounded and withers away. Sharon is like a desert, and Bashan and Carmel are stripped bare.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">“Now I will arise,” says Yahweh; “Now I will lift myself up. Now I will be exalted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">You will conceive chaff. You will bring forth stubble. Your breath is a fire that will devour you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The peoples will be like the burning of lime, like thorns that are cut down and burned in the fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hear, you who are far off, what I have done; and, you who are near, acknowledge my might.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The sinners in Zion are afraid. Trembling has seized the godless ones. Who among us can live with the devouring fire? Who among us can live with everlasting burning?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He who walks righteously, and speaks blamelessly; He who despises the gain of oppressions, who gestures with his hands, refusing to take a bribe, who stops his ears from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes from looking at evil—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">he will dwell on high. His place of defense will be the fortress of rocks. His bread will be supplied. His waters will be sure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Your eyes will see the king in his beauty. They will see a distant land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Your heart will meditate on the terror. Where is he who counted? Where is he who weighed? Where is he who counted the towers?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">You will no longer see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that you can’t comprehend, with a strange language that you can’t understand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Look at Zion, the city of our appointed festivals. Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a quiet habitation, a tent that won’t be removed. Its stakes will never be plucked up, nor will any of its cords be broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But there Yahweh will be with us in majesty, a place of broad rivers and streams, in which no galley with oars will go, neither will any gallant ship pass by there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For Yahweh is our judge. Yahweh is our lawgiver. Yahweh is our king. He will save us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Your rigging is untied. They couldn’t strengthen the foot of their mast. They couldn’t spread the sail. Then the prey of a great spoil was divided. The lame took the prey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The inhabitant won’t say, “I am sick.” The people who dwell therein will be forgiven their iniquity.</p>
