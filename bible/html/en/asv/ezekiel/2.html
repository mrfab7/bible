<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the Spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet; and I heard him that spake unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me even unto this very day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the children are impudent and stiffhearted: I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house), yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and he spread it before me: and it was written within and without; and there were written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</p>
