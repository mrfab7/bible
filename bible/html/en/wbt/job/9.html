<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I know it to be so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who removeth the mountains, and they know not: who overturneth them in his anger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Who shaketh the earth out of her place, and its pillars tremble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Who alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who doeth great things past finding out; yes, and wonders without number.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say to him, What doest thou?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If I had called, and he had answered me; yet I would not believe that he had hearkened to my voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">If I justify myself, my own mouth will condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, that also will prove me perverse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">This is one thing, therefore I said it, he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If the scourge shall slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of its judges; if not, where, and who is he?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">If I am wicked, why then do I labor in vain?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Yet wilt thou plunge me in the ditch, and my own clothes shall abhor me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Neither is there any judge between us, that might lay his hand upon us both.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Let him take away his rod from me, and let not his fear terrify me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.</p>
