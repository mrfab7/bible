<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Where is your beloved gone, O you fairest among women? where is your beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I am my belovedâ€™s, and my beloved is mine: he feeds among the lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">You are beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Turn away your eyes from me, for they have overcome me: your hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Your teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one bears twins, and there is not one barren among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">As a piece of a pomegranate are your temples within your locks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">There are three score queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yes, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who is she that looks forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished and the pomegranates budded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look on you. What will you see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.</p>
