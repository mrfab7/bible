  <verse number="1">At this my heart trembleth, and is moved out of its place.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hear ye attentively the terror of his voice, and the sound that cometh out of his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">He beholdeth under all the heavens, and his light is upon the ends of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">After it a noise shall roar, he shall thunder with the voice of his majesty, and shall not be found out, when his voice shall be heard.</verse>
  <verse number="5">God shall thunder wonderfully with his voice, he that doth great and unsearchable things.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He commandeth the snow to go down upon the earth, and the winter rain, and the shower of his strength.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He sealeth up the hand of all men, that every one may know his works.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then the beast shall go into his covert, and shall abide in his den.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Out of the inner parts shall a tempest come, and cold out of the north.</verse>
  <verse number="10">When God bloweth there cometh frost, and again the waters are poured out abundantly.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Corn desireth clouds, and the clouds spread their light :</verse>
  <verse number="12">Which go round about, whithersoever the will of him that governeth them shall lead them, to whatsoever he shall command them upon the face of the whole earth :</verse>
  <verse number="13">Whether in one tribe, or in his own land, or in what place soever of his mercy he shall command them to be found.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Hearken to these things, Job : Stand, and consider the wondrous works of God.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Dost thou know when God commanded the rains, to shew his light of his clouds?</verse>
  <verse number="16">Knowest thou the great paths of the clouds, and the perfect knowledges?</verse>
  <verse number="17">Are not thy garments hot, when the south wind blows upon the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Thou perhaps hast made the heavens with him, which are most strong, as if they were of molten brass.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Shew us what we may say to him : for we are wrapped up in darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Who shall tell him the things I speak? even if a man shall speak, he shall be swallowed up.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But now they see not the light : the air on a sudden shall be thickened into clouds, and the wind shall pass and drive them away.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Cold cometh out of the north, and to God praise with fear.</verse>
  <verse number="23">We cannot find him worthily : he is great in strength, and in judgment, and in justice, and he is ineffable.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore men shall fear him, and all that seem to themselves to be wise, shall not dare to behold him.</verse>
