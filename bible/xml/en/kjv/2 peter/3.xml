  <verse number="1">This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in [both] which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:</verse>
  <verse number="2">That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</verse>
  <verse number="4">And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as [they were] from the beginning of the creation.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:</verse>
  <verse number="6">Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:</verse>
  <verse number="7">But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day [is] with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</verse>
  <verse number="11">[Seeing] then [that] all these things shall be dissolved, what manner [of persons] ought ye to be in [all] holy conversation and godliness,</verse>
  <verse number="12">Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And account [that] the longsuffering of our Lord [is] salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;</verse>
  <verse number="16">As also in all [his] epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as [they do] also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know [these things] before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But grow in grace, and [in] the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him [be] glory both now and for ever. Amen.</verse>
