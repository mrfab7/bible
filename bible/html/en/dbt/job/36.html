<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Elihu proceeded and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet words for +God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Creator.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For truly my words shall be no falsehood: one perfect in knowledge is with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Lo, God is mighty, but despiseth not [any]; mighty in strength of understanding:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He saveth not the wicked alive; but he doeth justice to the afflicted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous, but with kings on the throne doth he even set them for ever; and they are exalted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And if, bound in fetters, they be held in cords of affliction,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions, because they have increased.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he openeth their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If they hearken and serve [him], they shall accomplish their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But if they hearken not, they shall pass away by the sword, and expire without knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But the godless in heart heap up anger; they cry not when he bindeth them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Their soul dieth in youth, and their life is among the unclean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But he delivereth the afflicted in his affliction, and openeth their ear in [their] oppression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Even so would he have allured thee out of the jaws of distress into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and the supply of thy table [would be] full of fatness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But thou art full of the judgments of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold [on thee].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Because there is wrath, [beware] lest it take thee away through chastisement: then a great ransom could not avail thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Will he esteem thy riches? Not gold, nor all the resources of strength!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Desire not the night, when peoples are cut off from their place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Take heed, turn not to iniquity; for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Lo, God is exalted in his power: who teacheth as he?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Who hath appointed him his way? or who hath said, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Remember that thou magnify his work, which men celebrate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">All men look at it; man beholdeth [it] afar off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Lo, God is great, and we comprehend [him] not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For he draweth up the drops of water: they distil in rain from the vapour which he formeth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Which the skies pour down [and] drop upon man abundantly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">But can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, [or] the crashing of his pavilion?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Lo, he spreadeth his light around him, and covereth the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For with them he judgeth the peoples; he giveth food in abundance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">[His] hands he covereth with lightning, and commandeth it where it is to strike.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">His thundering declareth concerning him; the cattle even, concerning its coming.</p>
