  <verse number="1">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">See, I have called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I have filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship,</verse>
  <verse number="4">To devise cunning works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,</verse>
  <verse number="5">And in cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of timber, to work in all manner of workmanship.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And I, behold, I have given with him Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan: and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you;</verse>
  <verse number="7">The tabernacle of the congregation, and the ark of the testimony, and the mercy seat that is thereupon, and all the furniture of the tabernacle,</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the table and his furniture, and the pure candlestick with all his furniture, and the altar of incense,</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the altar of burnt offering with all his furniture, and the laver and his foot,</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the cloths of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the priest’s office,</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the anointing oil, and sweet incense for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded you shall they do.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="13">Speak you also to the children of Israel, saying, Truly my sabbaths you shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am the LORD that does sanctify you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">You shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy to you: every one that defiles it shall surely be put to death: for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to the LORD: whoever does any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Why the children of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.</verse>
  <verse number="17">It is a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever: for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he gave to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him on mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.</verse>
