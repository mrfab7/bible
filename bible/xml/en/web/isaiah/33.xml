  <verse number="2">Yahweh, be gracious to us. We have waited for you. Be our strength every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.</verse>
  <verse number="3">At the noise of the thunder, the peoples have fled. When you lift yourself up, the nations are scattered.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Your spoil will be gathered as the caterpillar gathers. Men will leap on it as locusts leap.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Yahweh is exalted, for he dwells on high. He has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="6">There will be stability in your times, abundance of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge. The fear of Yahweh is your treasure.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Behold, their valiant ones cry outside; the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The highways are desolate. The traveling man ceases. The covenant is broken. He has despised the cities. He doesn’t respect man.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The land mourns and languishes. Lebanon is confounded and withers away. Sharon is like a desert, and Bashan and Carmel are stripped bare.</verse>
  <verse number="10">“Now I will arise,” says Yahweh; “Now I will lift myself up. Now I will be exalted.</verse>

  <verse number="15">He who walks righteously, and speaks blamelessly; He who despises the gain of oppressions, who gestures with his hands, refusing to take a bribe, who stops his ears from hearing of blood, and shuts his eyes from looking at evil—</verse>
  <verse number="16">he will dwell on high. His place of defense will be the fortress of rocks. His bread will be supplied. His waters will be sure.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Your eyes will see the king in his beauty. They will see a distant land.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Your heart will meditate on the terror. Where is he who counted? Where is he who weighed? Where is he who counted the towers?</verse>
  <verse number="19">You will no longer see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that you can’t comprehend, with a strange language that you can’t understand.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Look at Zion, the city of our appointed festivals. Your eyes will see Jerusalem, a quiet habitation, a tent that won’t be removed. Its stakes will never be plucked up, nor will any of its cords be broken.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But there Yahweh will be with us in majesty, a place of broad rivers and streams, in which no galley with oars will go, neither will any gallant ship pass by there.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For Yahweh is our judge. Yahweh is our lawgiver. Yahweh is our king. He will save us.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Your rigging is untied. They couldn’t strengthen the foot of their mast. They couldn’t spread the sail. Then the prey of a great spoil was divided. The lame took the prey.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The inhabitant won’t say, “I am sick.” The people who dwell therein will be forgiven their iniquity.</verse>
