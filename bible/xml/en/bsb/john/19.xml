  <verse number="1">Then Pilate took Jesus and had Him flogged.</verse>
  <verse number="2">The soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns, set it on His head, and dressed Him in a purple robe.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And they went up to Him again and again, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and slapping Him in the face.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Once again Pilate came out and said to the Jews, “Look, I am bringing Him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against Him.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">When Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe, Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”</verse>
  <verse number="6">As soon as the chief priests and officers saw Him, they shouted, “Crucify Him! Crucify Him!” “You take Him and crucify Him,” Pilate replied, “for I find no basis for a charge against Him.”</verse>
  <verse number="7">“We have a law,” answered the Jews, “and according to that law He must die, because He declared Himself to be the Son of God.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">When Pilate heard this statement, he was even more afraid,</verse>
  <verse number="9">and he went back into the Praetorium. “Where are You from?” he asked. But Jesus gave no answer.</verse>
  <verse number="10">So Pilate said to Him, “Do You refuse to speak to me? Do You not know that I have authority to release You and authority to crucify You?”</verse>
  <verse number="11">Jesus answered, “You would have no authority over Me if it were not given to you from above. Therefore the one who handed Me over to you is guilty of greater sin.”</verse>
  <verse number="12">From then on, Pilate tried to release Him, but the Jews kept shouting, “If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar. Anyone who declares himself a king is defying Caesar.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat on the judgment seat at a place called the Stone Pavement, which in Hebrew is Gabbatha.</verse>
  <verse number="14">It was the day of Preparation for the Passover, about the sixth hour. And Pilate said to the Jews, “Here is your King!”</verse>
  <verse number="15">At this, they shouted, “Away with Him! Away with Him! Crucify Him!” “Shall I crucify your King?” Pilate asked. “We have no king but Caesar,” replied the chief priests.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified, and the soldiers took Him away.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Carrying His own cross, He went out to The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.</verse>
  <verse number="18">There they crucified Him, and with Him two others, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Pilate also had a notice posted on the cross. It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Many of the Jews read this sign, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.</verse>
  <verse number="21">So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but only that He said, ‘I am the King of the Jews.’”</verse>
  <verse number="22">Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”</verse>
  <verse number="23">When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they divided His garments into four parts, one for each soldier, with the tunic remaining. It was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.</verse>
  <verse number="24">So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it. Instead, let us cast lots to see who will get it.” This was to fulfill the Scripture: “They divided My garments among them, and cast lots for My clothing.” So that is what the soldiers did.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Near the cross of Jesus stood His mother and her sister, as well as Mary the wife of Clopas and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
  <verse number="26">When Jesus saw His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing nearby, He said to His mother, “Woman, here is your son.”</verse>
  <verse number="27">Then He said to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” So from that hour, this disciple took her into his home.</verse>
  <verse number="28">After this, knowing that everything had now been accomplished, and to fulfill the Scripture, Jesus said, “I am thirsty.”</verse>
  <verse number="29">A jar of sour wine was sitting there. So they soaked a sponge in the wine, put it on a stalk of hyssop, and lifted it to His mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="30">When Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, “It is finished.” And bowing His head, He yielded up His spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="31">It was the day of Preparation, and the next day was a High Sabbath. In order that the bodies would not remain on the cross during the Sabbath, the Jews asked Pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies removed.</verse>
  <verse number="32">So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with Jesus, and those of the other.</verse>
  <verse number="33">But when they came to Jesus and saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Instead, one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water flowed out.</verse>
  <verse number="35">The one who saw it has testified to this, and his testimony is true. He knows that he is telling the truth, so that you also may believe.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Now these things happened so that the Scripture would be fulfilled: “Not one of His bones will be broken.”</verse>
  <verse number="37">And, as another Scripture says: “They will look on the One they have pierced.”</verse>
  <verse number="38">Afterward, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus (but secretly for fear of the Jews), asked Pilate to let him remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission, so he came and removed His body.</verse>
  <verse number="39">Nicodemus, who had previously come to Jesus at night, also brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about seventy-five pounds.</verse>
  <verse number="40">So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, according to the Jewish burial custom.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Now there was a garden in the place where Jesus was crucified, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been laid.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And because it was the Jewish day of Preparation and the tomb was nearby, they placed Jesus there.</verse>
