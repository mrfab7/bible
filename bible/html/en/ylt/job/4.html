<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith:—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hath one tried a word with thee?—Thou art weary! And to keep in words who is able?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Lo, thou hast instructed many, And feeble hands thou makest strong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The stumbling one do thy words raise up, And bowing knees thou dost strengthen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But now, it cometh in unto thee, And thou art weary; It striketh unto thee, and thou art troubled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Is not thy reverence thy confidence? Thy hope—the perfection of thy ways?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Remember, I pray thee, Who, being innocent, hath perished? And where have the upright been cut off?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">As I have seen—ploughers of iniquity, And sowers of misery, reap it!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">From the breath of God they perish, And from the spirit of His anger consumed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The roaring of a lion, And the voice of a fierce lion, And teeth of young lions have been broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">An old lion is perishing without prey, And the whelps of the lioness do separate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And unto me a thing is secretly brought, And receive doth mine ear a little of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">In thoughts from visions of the night, In the falling of deep sleep on men,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Fear hath met me, and trembling, And the multitude of my bones caused to fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And a spirit before my face doth pass, Stand up doth the hair of my flesh;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">It standeth, and I discern not its aspect, A similitude is over-against mine eyes, Silence! and a voice I hear:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">‘Is mortal man than God more righteous? Than his Maker is a man cleaner?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Lo, in His servants He putteth no credence, Nor in His messengers setteth praise.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Also—the inhabitants of houses of clay, (Whose foundation is in the dust, They bruise them before a moth.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">From morning to evening are beaten down, Without any regarding, for ever they perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Hath not their excellency been removed with them? They die, and not in wisdom!</p>
