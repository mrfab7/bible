  <verse number="1">Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;</verse>
  <verse number="2">But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father:</verse>
  <verse number="3">So we also, when we were children, were serving under the elements of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the law:</verse>
  <verse number="5">That he might redeem them who were under the law: that we might receive the adoption of sons.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And because you are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying: Abba, Father.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore now he is not a servant, but a son. And if a son, an heir also through God.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But then indeed, not knowing God, you served them, who, by nature, are not gods.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known by God: how turn you again to the weak and needy elements, which you desire to serve again?</verse>
  <verse number="10">You observe days, and months, and times, and years.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Be ye as I, because I also am as you: brethren, I beseech you: you have not injured me at all.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And you know, how through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel to you heretofore: and your temptation in my flesh,</verse>
  <verse number="14">You despised not, nor rejected: but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Where is then your blessedness? For I bear you witness, that, if it could be done, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and would have given them to me.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Am I then become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</verse>
  <verse number="17">They are zealous in your regard not well: but they would exclude you, that you might be zealous for them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But be zealous for that which is good in a good thing always: and not only when I am present with you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">My little children, of whom I am in labour again, until Christ be formed in you.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And I would willingly be present with you now, and change my voice: because I am ashamed for you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, have you not read the law?</verse>
  <verse number="22">For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, and the other by a free woman.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But he who was of the bondwoman, was born according to the flesh: but he of the free woman, was by promise.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Which things are said by an allegory. For these are the two testaments. The one from mount Sina, engendering unto bondage; which is Agar:</verse>
  <verse number="25">For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity to that Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.</verse>
  <verse number="26">But that Jerusalem, which is above, is free: which is our mother.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not: break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a husband.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.</verse>
  <verse number="29">But as then he, that was born according to the flesh, persecuted him that was after the spirit; so also it is now.</verse>
  <verse number="30">But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.</verse>
  <verse number="31">So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman, but of the free: by the freedom wherewith Christ has made us free.</verse>
