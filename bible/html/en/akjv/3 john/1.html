<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The elder to the well beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Beloved, I wish above all things that you may prosper and be in health, even as your soul prospers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I rejoiced greatly, when the brothers came and testified of the truth that is in you, even as you walk in the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Beloved, you do faithfully whatever you do to the brothers, and to strangers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Which have borne witness of your charity before the church: whom if you bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, you shall do well:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Because that for his nameâ€™s sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellow helpers to the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I wrote to the church: but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, receives us not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Why, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he does, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither does he himself receive the brothers, and forbids them that would, and casts them out of the church.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that does good is of God: but he that does evil has not seen God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Demetrius has good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yes, and we also bear record; and you know that our record is true.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write to you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But I trust I shall shortly see you, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to you. Our friends salute you. Greet the friends by name.</p>
