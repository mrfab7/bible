<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="13" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And if I have prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And if I shall dole out all my goods in food, and if I deliver up my body that I may be burned, but have not love, I profit nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Love has long patience, is kind; love is not emulous [of others]; love is not insolent and rash, is not puffed up,</verse>
  <verse number="5">does not behave in an unseemly manner, does not seek what is its own, is not quickly provoked, does not impute evil,</verse>
  <verse number="6">does not rejoice at iniquity but rejoices with the truth,</verse>
  <verse number="7">bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Love never fails; but whether prophecies, they shall be done away; or tongues, they shall cease; or knowledge, it shall be done away.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For we know in part, and we prophesy in part:</verse>
  <verse number="10">but when that which is perfect has come, that which is in part shall be done away.</verse>
  <verse number="11">When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I reasoned as a child; when I became a man, I had done with what belonged to the child.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For we see now through a dim window obscurely, but then face to face; now I know partially, but then I shall know according as I also have been known.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And now abide faith, hope, love; these three things; and the greater of these [is] love.</verse>
