  <verse number="1">Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the LORD said to me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.</verse>
  <verse number="3">So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
  <verse number="5">All these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides unwalled towns a great number.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children of every city.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side of Jordan, from the river of Arnon to mount Hermon;</verse>
  <verse number="9">(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call it Shenir;)</verse>
  <verse number="10">All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length of it, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and its cities, I gave to the Reubenites and to the Gadites.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob, to the borders of Geshuri, and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, to this day.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And I gave Gilead to Machir.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And to the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon:</verse>
  <verse number="17">The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast of it, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the plain, even the salt-sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God hath given you this land to possess it; ye shall pass over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know that ye have many cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have given you;</verse>
  <verse number="20">Until the LORD shall have given rest to your brethren, as well as to you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man to his possession which I have given you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thy eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done to these two kings: so shall the LORD do to all the kingdoms whither thou passest.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight for you.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="24">O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness, and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to thy might?</verse>
  <verse number="25">I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.</verse>
  <verse number="26">But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said to me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more to me of this matter.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Ascend to the top of Pisgah, and lift up thy eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold with thy eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.</verse>
  <verse number="29">So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.</verse>
