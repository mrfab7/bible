  <verse number="1">And after these Paul having departed from Athens, came to Corinth;</verse>
  <verse number="2">And having found a certain Jew by name Aquila, a Pontian by birth, having recently come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife; (for Claudius had ordered all Jews to be separated from Rome:) came to them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And because being of the same trade, he remained with them, and wrought: for they were by trade tentmakers.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he discussed in the synagogue on every sabbath, and persuaded Jews and Greeks.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was oppressed in spirit, testifying to the Jews Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And they opposing, and blaspheming, having shaken off the garments violently, he said to them, Your blood upon your head; I clean: from now will I go to the nations.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And having gone away thence, he came to the house of a certain Justus by name, worshipping God, whose house was adjoining the synagogue.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Crispus, ruler of the synagogue, believed the Lord with his whole house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptised.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the Lord said through a vision by night to Paul, Fear not, but speak, and thou shouldest not be silent:</verse>
  <verse number="10">For I am with thee, and none shall attack thee to injure thee: for much people are to me in this city.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he sat a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Gallio being proconsul of Achaia, the Jews arose unanimously against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,</verse>
  <verse number="13">Saying, This one persuades men to worship God against the law.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Paul being about to open the mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If therefore it were truly any injustice or wicked, criminal action, O Jews, against the word, I should have borne with you:</verse>
  <verse number="15">But if it is a question of the word, and names, and law, according to you, see ye yourselves; for I will not be judge of these.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he drave them away from the judgment seat.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And all the Greeks having taken Sosthenes, ruler of the synagogue, beat before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of these.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Paul yet having remained sufficient days, having taken leave of the brethren, sailed out to Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn the head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Paul arrived at Ephesus, and left those of his: and he having come into the synagogue, discussed with the Jews.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And they asking to remain with them for more time, he acquiesced not;</verse>
  <verse number="21">But he took leave of them, saying, I must at any rate do the coming festival in Jerusalem: and I will again return to you, God willing. And he was conveyed from Ephesus.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And having come down to Cesarea having gone up and greeted the church, he went down to Antioch.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And having made a certain time, he came out, passing in order the Galatian country and Phrygia, supporting all the disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by birth, an eloquent man, arrived at Ephesus, being able in the writings.</verse>
  <verse number="25">He was instructed in the way of the Lord; and boiling up in the spirit, he spake and taught attentively the things of the Lord, knowing only the immersion of John.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And he began to speak freely in the synagogue: and Priscilla and Aquila having heard him, took him, and set forth to him the way of God more accurately.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he wishing to pass through to Achaia, the brethren having encouraged, wrote to the disciples to receive him: who having arrived, profited much them having believed through grace:</verse>
  <verse number="28">For he mightily refuted the Jews publicly, shewing by the writings Jesus to be Christ.</verse>
