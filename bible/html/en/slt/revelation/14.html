<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And I saw, and, behold, a Lamb standing upon mount Sion, and with him a hundred forty-four thousand, having the name of his Father written in their foreheads.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of great thunder: and I heard the voice of harp players playing on their harps:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they sing as a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders: and none could learn the song, except the hundred forty-four thousand, purchased from the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">There are they who were not contaminated by women; for they are virgins. These are they following the Lamb wherever he should lead. These were purchased from men, first fruits to God and the Lamb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And guile was not found in their mouth: for they are blameless before the throne of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the lasting good news to announce to them dwelling upon the earth, and to every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Saying with a great voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment has come: and worship ye him having made the heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And another angel followed, saying, She fell, Babylon fell, the great city, for all nations has she given to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the third angel followed them, saying with a great voice, If any worship the wild beast and his image, and receive the stamp upon his forehead, or upon his hand,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, mingled pure in the cup of his anger; and he shall be tortured in fire and sulphur before the holy angels, and before the Lamb:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the smoke of their torture goes up forever and ever: and they have no rest day and night, those worshipping the wild beast and his image, and if any receive the stamp of his name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Here is the patience of the holy: here they keeping the commands of God, and the faith of Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And I heard a voice from heaven, saying, Write, Happy the dead who dying in the Lord from henceforth: Yes, says the Spirit, that they might cease from their fatigues; and their works follow with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And I saw, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud he sitting like the Son of man, having upon his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And another angel went forth out of the temple, crying with a great voice to him sitting upon the cloud, Send thy sickle, and reap: for the hour has come to thee to reap; for the earth’s harvest was dried up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he sitting upon the cloud cast his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And another angel came forth out of the temple which in heaven, the same also having a sharp sickle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And another angel came forth from the altar, having power over fire; and he called with a great cry to him having the sharp sickle, saying, Send thy sharp sickle, and harvest the grapes of the vineyard of the earth; for her grapes were fully ripe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the angel cast his sickle into the earth, and harvested the earth’s vineyard, and cast into the great winepress of the wrath of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the winepress was trodden under foot without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even to the horses’ bridles, from sixteen hundred stadia.</p>
