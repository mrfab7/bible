  <verse number="1">And Job answereth and saith:—</verse>
  <verse number="2">I have heard many such things, Miserable comforters are ye all.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Is there an end to words of wind? Or what doth embolden thee that thou answerest?</verse>
  <verse number="4">I also, like you, might speak, If your soul were in my soul’s stead. I might join against you with words, And nod at you with my head.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I might harden you with my mouth, And the moving of my lips might be sparing.</verse>
  <verse number="6">If I speak, my pain is not restrained, And I cease—what goeth from me?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Only, now, it hath wearied me; Thou hast desolated all my company,</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Thou dost loathe me, For a witness it hath been, And rise up against me doth my failure, In my face it testifieth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">His anger hath torn, and he hateth me, He hath gnashed at me with his teeth, My adversary sharpeneth his eyes for me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They have gaped on me with their mouth, In reproach they have smitten my cheeks, Together against me they set themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="11">God shutteth me up unto the perverse, And to the hands of the wicked turneth me over.</verse>
  <verse number="12">At ease I have been, and he breaketh me, And he hath laid hold on my neck, And he breaketh me in pieces, And he raiseth me to him for a mark.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Go round against me do his archers. He splitteth my reins, and spareth not, He poureth out to the earth my gall.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He breaketh me—breach upon breach, He runneth upon me as a mighty one.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Sackcloth I have sewed on my skin, And have rolled in the dust my horn.</verse>
  <verse number="16">My face is foul with weeping, And on mine eyelids is death-shade.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Not for violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure.</verse>
  <verse number="18">O earth, do not thou cover my blood! And let there not be a place for my cry.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Also, now, lo, in the heavens is my witness, And my testifier in the high places.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My interpreter is my friend, Unto God hath mine eye dropped:</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he reasoneth for a man with God, And a son of man for his friend.</verse>
  <verse number="22">When a few years do come, Then a path I return not do I go.</verse>
