<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And to Shemaiah his son have sons been born, who are ruling throughout the house of their father, for they are mighty of valour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Sons of Shemaiah are Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad; his brethren are sons of valour, Elihu and Semachiah,</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="27">from the battles, even from the spoil they sanctified to strengthen the house of Jehovah;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">and all that Samuel the seer, and Saul son of Kish, and Abner son of Ner, and Joab son of Zeruiah sanctified, every one sanctifying any thing—it is by the side of Shelomith and his brethren.</p>
