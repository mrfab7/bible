<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And love thou Jehovah thy God, and watch his watches and his laws and his judgments and his commands, all the days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And know ye this day, that not with your sons who knew not, and who saw not the corrections of Jehovah your God, his greatness, his strong hand and his extended arm,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And his signs and his doings which he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to all his land;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And what he did to the army of Egypt, to his horses and to his chariots, that he caused the water of the sea of sedge to overflow upon their face in their pursuing after you, and Jehovah will destroy them even to this day;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And what he did to you in the desert till your coming to this place;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And what he did to Dathan and to Abiram, sons of Eliab, son of Reuben; that the earth opened her mouth and she will swallow them down, and their houses, and their tents, and every living thing which is at their feet in the midst of all Israel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For your eyes saw every great doing of Jehovah which he did.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And watch ye every command which I command thee this day, so that ye shall be strengthened and go in and possess the land where ye are passing over there to possess it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And so that ye shall prolong the days upon the land which Jehovah sware to your fathers to give to them, and to their seed; a land flowing milk and honey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For the land where thou goest in there to possess it, it is not as the land of Egypt, where ye came from there, when thou shalt sow thy seed, and thou wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of green things:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the land where ye are passing over there to possess it, a land of mountains and valleys; according to the rain of the heavens it will drink water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A land which Jehovah thy God sought for it: continually are the eyes of Jehovah thy God upon it from the beginning of the year, and even to the last of the year.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And it was if hearing, ye shall hear to the commands which I command you this day, to love Jehovah your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And I gave the rain of your land in its time, the early and the latter rain; and gather thy grain and thy new wine and thy new oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And I gave the green herb in thy field for thy cattle, and eat thou and be satisfied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Watch ye to yourselves, lest your heart shall be enticed, and ye turn aside and serve other gods, and worship to them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the anger of Jehovah kindled against you, and he shut up the heavens and there shall not be rain, and the land shall not give her produce, and ye perished quickly from off the good land that Jehovah gave to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And put these words upon your heart and upon your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they were for bands between your eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And teach them to your sons to speak in them in thy resting in thy house, and in thy walking in the way, and in thy lying down, and in thy rising up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And write them upon the doorposts of thy house and upon thy gates.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">So that your days shall be multiplied, and the days of your sons, upon the land which Jehovah sware to your fathers to give to them, according to the days of the heavens upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For if watching, ye shall watch all this command which I command you to do it, to love Jehovah thy God, to go in all his ways, and to cleave to him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Jehovah dispossessed all these nations from before you, and ye possessed nations great and strong above you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Every place which the sole of your foot shall tread upon it, to you shall it be, from the desert and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, and even to the last sea shall be your boundary.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">A man shall not stand up against your face: your terror and your fear, Jehovah your God shall give upon the face of all the earth which ye shall tread upon it, as he spake to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">See, I give before you this day, a blessing and a cursing:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">A blessing when ye shall hear to the commands of Jehovah your God which I command you this day;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And a cursing if ye shall not hear to the commands of Jehovah your God, and ye turned aside from the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods which thou knewest not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And it was when Jehovah thy. God shall bring thee in to the land where thou goest in there to possess it, and give thou the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the cursing upon mount Ebal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Are they not in the other side of Jordan behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanite dwelling in the desert over against Gilgal, by the oaks of Moreh?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For ye are passing over Jordan to go in to possess the land which Jehovah your God gave to you; and ye possessed it and dwelt in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And watch ye to do all the laws and the judgments which I give before you this day.</p>
