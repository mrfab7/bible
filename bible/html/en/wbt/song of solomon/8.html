<p class="verse" data-verse="1">O that thou wert as my brother, that was nourished at the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yes, I should not be despised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I would lead thee, and bring thee into my motherâ€™s house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not, nor awake my love, until he please.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple-tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bore thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Set me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thy arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals of it are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="9">If she is a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she is a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; every one for the fruit of it was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">My vineyard which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit of it two hundred.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of spices.</p>
