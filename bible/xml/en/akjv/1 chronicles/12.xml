  <verse number="3">The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite.</verse>

  <verse number="17">And David went out to meet them, and answered and said to them, If you be come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit to you: but if you be come to betray me to my enemies, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Then the spirit came on Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Your are we, David, and on your side, you son of Jesse: peace, peace be to you, and peace be to your helpers; for your God helps you.

  <verse number="21">And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valor, and were captains in the host.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For at that time day by day there came to David to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God.</verse>
