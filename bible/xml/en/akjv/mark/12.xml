<chapter book="Mark" number="12" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And he began to speak to them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and dig a place for the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to farmers, and went into a far country.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And at the season he sent to the farmers a servant, that he might receive from the farmers of the fruit of the vineyard.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And again he sent to them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully handled.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Having yet therefore one son, his well beloved, he sent him also last to them, saying, They will reverence my son.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But those farmers said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our’s.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the vineyard.</verse>
  <verse number="9">What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And have you not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:</verse>
  <verse number="11">This was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And they send to him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in his words.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And when they were come, they say to him, Master, we know that you are true, and care for no man: for you regard not the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, Why tempt you me? bring me a penny, that I may see it.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they brought it. And he said to them, Whose is this image and superscription? And they said to him, Caesar’s.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Jesus answering said to them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they marveled at him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Then come to him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="19">Master, Moses wrote to us, If a man’s brother die, and leave his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Now there were seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.</verse>
  <verse number="23">In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Jesus answering said to them, Do you not therefore err, because you know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?</verse>
  <verse number="25">For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And as touching the dead, that they rise: have you not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spoke to him, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</verse>
  <verse number="27">He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: you therefore do greatly err.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:</verse>
  <verse number="30">And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength: this is the first commandment.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the second is like, namely this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is none other commandment greater than these.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And the scribe said to him, Well, Master, you have said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:</verse>
  <verse number="33">And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that dared ask him any question.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?</verse>
  <verse number="36">For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you on my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool.</verse>
  <verse number="37">David therefore himself calls him Lord; and from where is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And he said to them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,</verse>
  <verse number="39">And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:</verse>
  <verse number="40">Which devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And he called to him his disciples, and said to them, Truly I say to you, That this poor widow has cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:</verse>
  <verse number="44">For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.</verse>
