  <verse number="1">The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkijah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:</verse>
  <verse number="2">to whom the word of Jehovah came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign;</verse>
  <verse number="3">it came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive, in the fifth month.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I hallowed thee, I appointed thee a prophet unto the nations.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And I said, Alas, Lord Jehovah! behold, I cannot speak; for I am a child.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But Jehovah said unto me, Say not, I am a child; for thou shalt go to whomsoever I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Be not afraid of them; for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Jehovah put forth his hand and touched my mouth; and Jehovah said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="10">See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to pluck up, and to break down, and to destroy, and to overthrow, to build and to plant.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond-tree.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Jehovah said unto me, Thou hast well seen; for I am watchful over my word to perform it.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the word of Jehovah came to me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething-pot, and its face is from the north.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Jehovah said unto me, Out of the north shall evil break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For behold, I am calling all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith Jehovah, and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah:</verse>
  <verse number="16">and I will pronounce my judgments against them for all their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Thou, therefore, gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I shall command thee: be not dismayed at them, lest I cause thee to be dismayed before them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And I, behold, I appoint thee this day as a strong city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls, against the whole land; against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to deliver thee.</verse>
