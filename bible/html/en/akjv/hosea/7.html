<div class="chapter" data-book="Hosea" data-chapter="7" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief comes in, and the troop of robbers spoils without.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceases from raising after he has kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleeps all the night; in the morning it burns as a flaming fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calls to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Ephraim, he has mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knows it not: yes, gray hairs are here and there on him, yet he knows not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the pride of Israel testifies to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When they shall go, I will spread my net on them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Woe to them! for they have fled from me: destruction to them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And they have not cried to me with their heart, when they howled on their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</p>
