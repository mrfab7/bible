<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Timothy" data-chapter="5" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">An aged person thou mayest not rebuke, but be entreating as a father; younger persons as brethren;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">aged women as mothers, younger ones as sisters—in all purity;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">honour widows who are really widows;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and if any widow have children or grandchildren, let them learn first to their own house to show piety, and to give back a recompense to the parents, for this is right and acceptable before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And she who is really a widow and desolate, hath hoped upon God, and doth remain in the supplications and in the prayers night and day,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and she who is given to luxury, living—hath died;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and these things charge, that they may be blameless;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">and if any one for his own—and especially for those of the household—doth not provide, the faith he hath denied, and than an unbeliever he is worse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A widow—let her not be enrolled under sixty years of age, having been a wife of one husband,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">in good works being testified to: if she brought up children, if she entertained strangers, if saints’ feet she washed, if those in tribulation she relieved, if every good work she followed after;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and younger widows be refusing, for when they may revel against the Christ, they wish to marry,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">having judgment, because the first faith they did cast away,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and at the same time also, they learn to be idle, going about the houses; and not only idle, but also tattlers and busybodies, speaking the things they ought not;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I wish, therefore, younger ones to marry, to bear children, to be mistress of the house, to give no occasion to the opposer to reviling;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">for already certain did turn aside after the Adversary.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If any believing man or believing woman have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the assembly be burdened, that those really widows it may relieve.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The well-leading elders of double honour let them be counted worthy, especially those labouring in word and teaching,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">for the Writing saith, ‘An ox treading out thou shalt not muzzle,’ and ‘Worthy is the workman of his reward.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Against an elder an accusation receive not, except upon two or three witnesses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Those sinning, reprove before all, that the others also may have fear;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">I testify fully, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the choice messengers, that these things thou mayest keep, without forejudging, doing nothing by partiality.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Be laying hands quickly on no one, nor be having fellowship with sins of others; be keeping thyself pure;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">no longer be drinking water, but a little wine be using, because of thy stomach and of thine often infirmities;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">of certain men the sins are manifest beforehand, leading before to judgment, and certain also they follow after;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">in like manner also the right works are manifest beforehand, and those that are otherwise are not able to be hid.</p>
