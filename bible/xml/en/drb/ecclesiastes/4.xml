<chapter book="Ecclesiastes" number="4" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">I turned myself to other things, and I saw the oppressions that are done under the sun, and the tears of the innocent, and they had no comforter; and they were not able to resist their violence, being destitute of help from any.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And I praised the dead rather than the living:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I judged him happier than them both, that is not yet born, nor hath seen the evils that are done under the sun.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Again I considered all the labours of men, and I remarked that their industries are exposed to the envy of their neighhour: so in this also there is vanity, and fruitless care.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="6">Better is a handful with rest, than both hands full with labour, and vexation of mind.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Considering I found also another vanity under the sun:</verse>
  <verse number="8">There is but one, and he hath not a second, no child, no brother, and yet he ceaseth not to labour, neither are his eyes satisfied with riches, neither doth he reflect, saying: For whom do I labour, and defraud my soul of good things? in this also is vanity, and a grievous vexation.</verse>
  <verse number="9">It is better therefore that two should be together, than one: for they have the advantage of their society:</verse>
  <verse number="10">If one fall he shall be supported by the other: woe to him that is alone, for when he falleth, he hath none to lift him up.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And if two lie together, they shall warm one another: how shall one alone be warmed?</verse>
  <verse number="12">And if a man prevail against one, two shall withstand him: a threefold cord is not easily broken.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Better is a child that is poor and wise, than a king that is old and foolish, who knoweth not to foresee for hereafter.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Because out of prison and chains sometimes a man cometh forth to a kingdom: and another born king is consumed with poverty.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I saw all men living, that walk under the sun with the second young man, who shall rise up in his place.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The number of the people, of all that were before him is infinite: and they that shall come afterwards, shall not rejoice in him: but this also is vanity, and vexation of spirit.</verse>
