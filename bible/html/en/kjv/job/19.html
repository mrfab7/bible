<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed [that] ye make yourselves strange to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And be it indeed [that] I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If indeed ye will magnify [yourselves] against me, and plead against me my reproach:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but [there is] no judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown [from] my head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as [one of] his enemies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I called my servant, and he gave [me] no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the childrenâ€™s [sake] of mine own body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For I know [that] my redeemer liveth, and [that] he shall stand at the latter [day] upon the earth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And [though] after my skin [worms] destroy this [body], yet in my flesh shall I see God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; [though] my reins be consumed within me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath [bringeth] the punishments of the sword, that ye may know [there is] a judgment.</p>
