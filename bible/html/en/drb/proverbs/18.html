<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The wicked man when he is come into the depth of sins, contemneth: but ignominy and reproach follow him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Words from the mouth of a men are as deep water: and the fountain of wisdom as an overflowing stream.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to decline from the truth of judgment.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The mouth of a fool is his destruction: and his lips are the ruin of his soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The words of the double tongued are as if they were harmless: and they reach even to the inner parts of the bowels. Fear casteth down the slothful: and the souls of the effeminate shall be hungry.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The just is first accuser of himself: his friend cometh, and shall search him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The lot suppresseth contentions, and determineth even between the mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A brother that is helped by his brother, is like a strong city: and judgments are like the bars of cities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Of the fruit of a man’s mouth shall his belly be satisfied: and the offspring of his lips shall fill him.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="24">A man amiable in society, shall be more friendly than a brother.</p>
