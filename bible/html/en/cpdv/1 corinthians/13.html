<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="13" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">If I were to speak in the language of men, or of Angels, yet not have charity, I would be like a clanging bell or a crashing cymbal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And if I have prophecy, and learn every mystery, and obtain all knowledge, and possess all faith, so that I could move mountains, yet not have charity, then I am nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And if I distribute all my goods in order to feed the poor, and if I hand over my body to be burned, yet not have charity, it offers me nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Charity is patient, is kind. Charity does not envy, does not act wrongly, is not inflated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Charity is not ambitious, does not seek for itself, is not provoked to anger, devises no evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Charity does not rejoice over iniquity, but rejoices in truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Charity suffers all, believes all, hopes all, endures all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Charity is never torn away, even if prophecies pass away, or languages cease, or knowledge is destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For we know only in part, and we prophesy only in part.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But when the perfect arrives, the imperfect passes away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I understood like a child, I thought like a child. But when I became a man, I put aside the things of a child.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now we see through a glass darkly. But then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know, even as I am known.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But for now, these three continue: faith, hope, and charity. And the greatest of these is charity.</p>
