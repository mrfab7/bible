  <verse number="1">And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Command the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, When ye are coming in unto the land of Canaan—this is the land which falleth to you by inheritance, the land of Canaan, by its borders—</verse>
  <verse number="3">then hath the south quarter been to you from the wilderness of Zin, by the sides of Edom, yea, the south border hath been to you from the extremity of the Salt Sea, eastward;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and the border hath turned round to you from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and hath passed on to Zin, and its outgoings have been from the south to Kadesh-Barnea, and it hath gone out at Hazar-Addar, and hath passed on to Azmon;</verse>
  <verse number="5">and the border hath turned round from Azmon to the brook of Egypt, and its outgoings have been at the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="6">‘As to the west border, even the great sea hath been to you a border; this is to you the west border.</verse>
  <verse number="7">‘And this is to you the north border: from the great sea ye mark out for yourselves mount Hor;</verse>
  <verse number="8">from mount Hor ye mark out to go in to Hamath, and the outgoings of the border have been to Zedad;</verse>
  <verse number="9">and the border hath gone out to Ziphron, and its outgoings have been at Hazar-Enan; this is to you the north border.</verse>
  <verse number="10">‘And ye have marked out for yourselves for the border eastward, from Hazar-Enan to Shepham;</verse>
  <verse number="11">and the border hath gone down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east of Ain, and the border hath gone down, and hath smitten against the shoulder of the sea of Chinnereth eastward;</verse>
  <verse number="12">and the border hath gone down to the Jordan, and its outgoings have been at the Salt Sea; this is for you the land by its borders round about.’</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Moses commandeth the sons of Israel, saying, ‘This is the land which ye inherit by lot, which Jehovah hath commanded to give to the nine tribes and the half of the tribe;</verse>
  <verse number="14">for the tribe of the sons of Reuben have received, by the house of their fathers; and the tribe of the children of Gad, by the house of their fathers; and the half of the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance;</verse>
  <verse number="15">the two tribes and the half of the tribe have received their inheritance beyond the Jordan, near Jericho, eastward, at the sun -rising.’</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="17">These are the names of the men who give to you the inheritance of the land: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua son of Nun,</verse>
  <verse number="18">and one prince—one prince—for a tribe ye do take to give the land by inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And these are the names of the men: of the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh;</verse>
  <verse number="20">and of the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Shemuel son of Aminihud;</verse>
  <verse number="21">of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad son of Chislon;</verse>

  <verse number="23">of the sons of Joseph, of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh, the prince Hanniel son of Ephod;</verse>
  <verse number="24">and of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim, the prince Kemuel son of Shiphtan;</verse>
  <verse number="25">and of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun, the prince Elizaphan son of Parnach;</verse>
  <verse number="26">and of the tribe of the sons of Issachar, the prince Paltiel son of Azzan;</verse>
  <verse number="27">and of the tribe of the sons of Asher, the prince Ahihud son of Shelomi;</verse>
  <verse number="28">and of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali, the prince Pedahel son of Ammihud.’</verse>
