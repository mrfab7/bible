  <verse number="1">And Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">If a word were essayed to thee, wouldest thou be grieved? But who can refrain from speaking?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands;</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thy words have upholden him that was stumbling, and thou hast braced up the bending knees:</verse>
  <verse number="5">But now it is come upon thee, and thou grievest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Hath not thy piety been thy confidence, and the perfection of thy ways thy hope?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Remember, I pray thee, who that was innocent has perished? and where were the upright cut off?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Even as I have seen, they that plough iniquity and sow mischief, reap the same.</verse>
  <verse number="9">By the breath of +God they perish, and by the blast of his nostrils are they consumed.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The roar of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken;</verse>
  <verse number="11">The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the whelps of the lioness are scattered.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now to me a word was secretly brought, and mine ear received a whisper thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="13">In thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men:—</verse>
  <verse number="14">Fear came on me, and trembling, and made all my bones to shake;</verse>
  <verse number="15">And a spirit passed before my face—the hair of my flesh stood up—</verse>
  <verse number="16">It stood still; I could not discern the appearance thereof: a form was before mine eyes; I heard a slight murmur and a voice:</verse>
  <verse number="17">Shall [mortal] man be more just than +God? Shall a man be purer than his Maker?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Lo, he trusteth not his servants, and his angels he chargeth with folly:</verse>
  <verse number="19">How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed as the moth!</verse>
  <verse number="20">From morning to evening are they smitten: without any heeding it, they perish for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Is not their tent-cord torn away in them? they die, and without wisdom.</verse>
