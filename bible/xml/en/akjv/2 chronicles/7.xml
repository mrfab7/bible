<chapter book="2 Chronicles" number="7" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD, because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD’s house.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down, and the glory of the LORD on the house, they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground on the pavement, and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endures for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with instruments of music of the LORD, which David the king had made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endures for ever, when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the brazen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath to the river of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the LORD had showed to David, and to Solomon, and to Israel his people.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king’s house: and all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in the house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said to him, I have heard your prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house of sacrifice.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;</verse>
  <verse number="14">If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Now my eyes shall be open, and my ears attentive to the prayer that is made in this place.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be there for ever: and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And as for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and shall observe my statutes and my judgments;</verse>
  <verse number="18">Then will I establish the throne of your kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David your father, saying, There shall not fail you a man to be ruler in Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But if you turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods, and worship them;</verse>
  <verse number="20">Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passes by it; so that he shall say, Why has the LORD done thus to this land, and to this house?</verse>
  <verse number="22">And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore has he brought all this evil on them.</verse>
