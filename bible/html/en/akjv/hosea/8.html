<div class="chapter" data-book="Hosea" data-chapter="8" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Set the trumpet to your mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Israel shall cry to me, My God, we know you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Israel has cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Your calf, O Samaria, has cast you off; my anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocence?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it has no stalk; the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim has hired lovers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Yes, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Because Ephraim has made many altars to sin, altars shall be to him to sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of my offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepts them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For Israel has forgotten his Maker, and builds temples; and Judah has multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire on his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.</p>
