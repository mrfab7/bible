<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="18" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeks and intermeddles with all wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A fool has no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">When the wicked comes, then comes also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The words of a man’s mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">A fool’s lips enter into contention, and his mouth calls for strokes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">A fool’s mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runs into it, and is safe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honor is humility.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He that answers a matter before he hears it, it is folly and shame to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The heart of the prudent gets knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeks knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A man’s gift makes room for him, and brings him before great men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He that is first in his own cause seems just; but his neighbor comes and searches him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The lot causes contentions to cease, and parts between the mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A man’s belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Whoever finds a wife finds a good thing, and obtains favor of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The poor uses entreaties; but the rich answers roughly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">A man that has friends must show himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticks closer than a brother.</p>
