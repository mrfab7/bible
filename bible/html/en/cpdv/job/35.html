<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After this, Eliu again spoke in this way:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Does it seem right to you in your thoughts, that you should say, “I am more just than God?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For you said, “Having done what is right does not please you,” and, “How will it benefit you, if I sin?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And so, I will respond to your words, and to your friends who are with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Look up towards heaven and consider; also, think about the sky, which is higher than you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If you sin, how will it hurt him? And if your iniquities are multiplied, what will you do against him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Furthermore, if you act justly, what will you give him, or what will he receive from your hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Your impiety may hurt a man who is like you, though your justice may help the son of the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Because of the multitude of false accusers, they will cry out; and they will lament because of the strong arm of the tyrants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Yet he has not said: “Where is God, who made me, who has given songs in the night,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">who teaches us in addition to the beasts of the earth, and who educates us along with the birds of the air?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">There they will cry, and he will not heed them, because of the arrogance of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Therefore, God does not hear in vain, and the Almighty will look into each and every case.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And so, when you say, “He does not examine,” be judged before him, but wait for him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For, at the present time, he does not bring forth his fury, nor does he punish sin exceedingly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Therefore, Job has opened his mouth in vain and has multiplied words without knowledge.</p>
