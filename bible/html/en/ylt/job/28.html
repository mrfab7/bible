<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Surely there is for silver a source, And a place for the gold they refine;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Iron from the dust is taken, And from the firm stone brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">An end hath he set to darkness, And to all perfection he is searching, A stone of darkness and death-shade.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A stream hath broken out from a sojourner, Those forgotten of the foot, They were low, from man they wandered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The earth! from it cometh forth bread, And its under-part is turned like fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">A place of the sapphire are its stones, And it hath dust of gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">A path—not known it hath a ravenous fowl, Nor scorched it hath an eye of the kite,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Nor trodden it have the sons of pride, Not passed over it hath the fierce lion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Against the flint he sent forth his hand, He overturned from the root mountains.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Among rocks, brooks he hath cleaved, And every precious thing hath his eye seen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">From overflowing floods he hath bound, And the hidden thing bringeth out to light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the wisdom—whence is it found? And where is this, the place of understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Man hath not known its arrangement, Nor is it found in the land of the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The deep hath said, ‘It is not in me,’ And the sea hath said, ‘It is not with me.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Gold is not given for it, Nor is silver weighed—its price.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">It is not valued with pure gold of Ophir, With precious onyx and sapphire,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Not equal it do gold and crystal, Nor is its exchange a vessel of fine gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Corals and pearl are not remembered, The acquisition of wisdom is above rubies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Not equal it doth the topaz of Cush, With pure gold it is not valued.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the wisdom—whence doth it come? And where is this, the place of understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">It hath been hid from the eyes of all living. And from the fowl of the heavens It hath been hidden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Destruction and death have said: ‘With our ears we have heard its fame.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">God hath understood its way, And He hath known its place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For He to the ends of the earth doth look, Under the whole heavens He doth see,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">To make for the wind a weight, And the waters He meted out in measure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">In His making for the rain a limit, And a way for the brightness of the voices,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Then He hath seen and declareth it, He hath prepared it, and also searched it out,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And He saith to man:—‘Lo, fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, And to turn from evil is understanding.’</p>
