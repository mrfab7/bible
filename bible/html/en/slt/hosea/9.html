<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Thou shalt not rejoice, O Israel; exult not as the peoples: for thou didst commit fornication from thy God; thou didst love a gift upon all the threshing-floors of grain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The threshing-floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They shall not dwell in the land of Jehovah; and Ephraim turned back to Egypt, and in Assur they shall eat the unclean thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They shall not pour out wine to Jehovah, and they shall not be pleasant to him: their sacrifices as the bread of sorrows to them; all eating it shall be defiled: for their bread for their soul shall not come in to the house of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">What will ye do for the day of appointment, and for the day of the festival of Jehovah?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For behold, they went from destruction: Egypt shall gather them together; Memphis shall bury them: the desire for their silver, the prickly weed shall possess them: the thorn in their tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The days of oversight came, the days of recompense came; Israel knew: the prophet is foolish, the man of the spirit, raving, for the multitude of thine iniquity and great destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The watchman of Ephraim with God: the prophet the snare of a fowler upon all his ways; destruction in the house of his God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They made deep, they were corrupted as the days of the hill: he will remember their iniquity, he will review their sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I found Israel as grapes in the desert; as the first fruit in the fig tree in her beginning I saw your fathers: they went to Baal-Peor, and they will separate themselves to shame, and their abominable things will be according to their love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Ephraim shall fly away as a bird, their glory of birth and of the womb and of conception.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But if they shall bring up their sons and I bereaved them from man: but also wo to them in my departing from them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Ephraim, as I saw for Tyre, was planted in a habitation: and Ephraim to bring forth his sons to him slaying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Give to them, O Jehovah: what wilt thou give? give to them a miscarrying womb, and dry breasts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All their wickedness in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for the evil of their doings I will drive them out from my house, I will not add to love them: all their chiefs are turning away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Ephraim was smitten, their root was dried up, they shall not make fruit: also if they shall bring forth, and I destroyed the desires of their womb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">God will reject them, for they heard not to him: and they will be wandering about among the nations.</p>
