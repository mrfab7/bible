  <verse number="1">Now these are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day that the LORD spoke with Moses in mount Sinai.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And these are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the first-born, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.</verse>
  <verse number="3">These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests that were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest’s office.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offered strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had no children; and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest’s office in the presence of Aaron their father.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="6">Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron the priest, that they may minister unto him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tent of meeting, to do the service of the tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And they shall keep all the furniture of the tent of meeting, and the charge of the children of Israel, to do the service of the tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons; they are wholly given unto him from the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, that they may keep their priesthood; and the common man that draweth nigh shall be put to death.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="12">And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of Israel instead of every first-born that openeth the womb among the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be Mine;</verse>
  <verse number="13">for all the first-born are Mine: on the day that I smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto Me all the first-born in Israel, both man and beast, Mine they shall be: I am the LORD.’</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the LORD spoke unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="15">Number the children of Levi by their fathers’ houses, by their families; every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them.’</verse>
