<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But him that is weak in faith receive ye, yet not to doubtful disputations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">One man hath faith to eat all things: but he that is weak eateth herbs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Let not him that eateth set at nought him that eateth not; and let not him that eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? to his own lord he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be made to stand; for the Lord hath power to make him stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let each man be fully assured in his own mind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord: and he that eateth, eateth unto the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, unto the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For none of us liveth to himself, and none dieth to himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For to this end Christ died, and lived again, that he might be Lord of both the dead and the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother? or thou again, why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment-seat of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, to me every knee shall bow, And every tongue shall confess to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge ye this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock in his brother’s way, or an occasion of falling.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself: save that to him who accounteth anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For if because of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer in love. Destroy not with thy meat him for whom Christ died.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For he that herein serveth Christ is well-pleasing to God, and approved of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">So then let us follow after things which make for peace, and things whereby we may edify one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Overthrow not for meat’s sake the work of God. All things indeed are clean; howbeit it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">It is good not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do anything whereby thy brother stumbleth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The faith which thou hast, have thou to thyself before God. Happy is he that judgeth not himself in that which he approveth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But he that doubteth is condemned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith; and whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</p>
