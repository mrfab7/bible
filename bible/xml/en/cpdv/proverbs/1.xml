<chapter book="Proverbs" number="1" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The parables of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel,</verse>
  <verse number="2">in order to know wisdom and discipline,</verse>
  <verse number="3">to understand words of prudence, and to accept the instruction of doctrine, justice and judgment, and equity,</verse>
  <verse number="4">so as to give discernment to little ones, knowledge and understanding to adolescents.</verse>
  <verse number="5">By listening, the wise shall become wiser and the intelligent shall possess governments.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He shall turn his soul to a parable and to its interpretation, to the words of the wise and their enigmas.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. The foolish despise wisdom as well as doctrine.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Listen, my son, to the discipline of your father, and forsake not the law of your mother,</verse>
  <verse number="9">so that grace may be added to your head and a collar to your neck.</verse>
  <verse number="10">My son, if sinners should entice you, do not consent to them.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If they should say: “Come with us. We will lie in wait for blood. We will lay traps against the innocent, without cause.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Let us swallow him alive, like Hell, and whole, like one descending into the pit.</verse>
  <verse number="13">We will discover every precious substance. We will fill our houses with spoils.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Cast your lot with us. One purse will be for us all.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">My son, do not walk with them. Preclude your feet from their paths.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For their feet rush to evil, and they hurry to shed blood.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But a net is thrown in vain before the eyes of those who have wings.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Likewise, they lie in ambush against their own blood, and they undertake deceits against their own souls.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Thus, the ways of all those who are greedy seize the souls of those who possess.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Wisdom forewarns far and wide; she bestows her voice in the streets.</verse>
  <verse number="21">She cries out at the head of crowds; at the entrance of the gates of the city, she offers her words, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="22">“Little ones, how long will you choose to be childish, and how long will the foolish desire what is harmful to themselves, and how long will the imprudent hate knowledge?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Be converted by my correction. Lo, I will offer my spirit to you, and I will reveal my words to you.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For I called, and you refused. I extended my hand, and there was no one who watched.</verse>
  <verse number="25">You have despised all my counsels, and you have neglected my rebukes.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Similarly, I will ridicule you at your demise, and I will mock you, when that which you feared shall overcome you.</verse>
  <verse number="27">When sudden calamity rushes upon you, and your demise advances like a tempest, when tribulation and anguish overcome you,</verse>
  <verse number="28">then they will call to me, and I will not heed, they will arise in the morning, and not find me.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For they held hatred for discipline, and they would not accept the fear of the Lord;</verse>
  <verse number="30">they would not consent to my counsel, but they detracted from all of my corrections.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Therefore, they shall eat the fruit of their way, and they shall have their fill of their own counsels.</verse>
  <verse number="32">The loathing of the little ones shall destroy them, and the prosperity of the foolish shall perish them.</verse>
  <verse number="33">But whoever will listen to me shall rest without terror, and shall have full enjoyment of abundance, without fear of evils.”</verse>
