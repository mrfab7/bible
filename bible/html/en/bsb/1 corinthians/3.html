<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="3" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual, but as worldly—as infants in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for solid food. In fact, you are still not ready,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">for you are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and dissension among you, are you not worldly? Are you not walking in the way of man?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For when one of you says, “I follow Paul,” and another, “I follow Apollos,” are you not mere men?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? They are servants through whom you believed, as the Lord has assigned to each his role.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I planted the seed and Apollos watered it, but God made it grow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He who plants and he who waters are one in purpose, and each will be rewarded according to his own labor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s field, God’s building.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">By the grace God has given me, I laid a foundation as an expert builder, and someone else is building on it. But each one must be careful how he builds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For no one can lay a foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If anyone builds on this foundation using gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">his workmanship will be evident, because the Day will bring it to light. It will be revealed with fire, and the fire will prove the quality of each man’s work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If what he has built survives, he will receive a reward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If it is burned up, he will suffer loss. He himself will be saved, but only as if through the flames.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Do you not know that you yourselves are God’s temple, and that God’s Spirit dwells in you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him; for God’s temple is holy, and you are that temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Let no one deceive himself. If any of you thinks he is wise in this age, he should become a fool, so that he may become wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness in God’s sight. As it is written: “He catches the wise in their craftiness.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Therefore, stop boasting in men. All things are yours,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future. All of them belong to you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.</p>
