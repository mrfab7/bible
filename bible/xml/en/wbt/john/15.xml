  <verse number="1">I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Every branch in me that beareth not fruit, he taketh away; and every branch that beareth fruit, he cleaneth it, that it my bring forth more fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken to you.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine: no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="6">If a man abideth not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered: and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</verse>
  <verse number="7">If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye may ask what ye will, and it shall be done to you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">In this is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="9">As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.</verse>
  <verse number="11">These things have I spoken to you, that my joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full.</verse>
  <verse number="12">This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Ye are my friends, if ye do whatever I command you.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard from my Father, I have made known to you.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</verse>
  <verse number="17">These things I command you, that ye love one another.</verse>
  <verse number="18">If the world hateth you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">If ye were of the world, the world would love its own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Remember the word that I said to you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you: if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But all these things will they do to you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He that hateth me, hateth my Father also.</verse>
  <verse number="24">If I had not done among them the works which no other man hath done, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen, and hated both me and my Father.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</verse>
  <verse number="26">But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he will testify concerning me.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And ye also shall bear testimony, because ye have been with me from the beginning.</verse>
