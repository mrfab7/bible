<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, Whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me? Men in whom ripe age is perished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They are gaunt with want and famine; They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of wasteness and desolation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They pluck salt-wort by the bushes; And the roots of the broom are their food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">They are driven forth from the midst of men; They cry after them as after a thief;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">So that they dwell in frightful valleys, In holes of the earth and of the rocks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Among the bushes they bray; Under the nettles they are gathered together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They are children of fools, yea, children of base men; They were scouraged out of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And now I am become their song, Yea, I am a byword unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, And spare not to spit in my face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For he hath loosed his cord, and afflicted me; And they have cast off the bridle before me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Upon my right hand rise the rabble; They thrust aside my feet, And they cast up against me their ways of destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They mar my path, They set forward my calamity, Even men that have no helper.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">As through a wide breach they come: In the midst of the ruin they roll themselves upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Terrors are turned upon me; They chase mine honor as the wind; And my welfare is passed away as a cloud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And now my soul is poured out within me; Days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">In the night season my bones are pierced in me, And the pains that gnaw me take no rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">By Godâ€™s great force is my garment disfigured; It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He hath cast me into the mire, And I am become like dust and ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I cry unto thee, and thou dost not answer me: I stand up, and thou gazest at me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Thou art turned to be cruel to me; With the might of thy hand thou persecutest me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Thou liftest me up to the wind, thou causest me to ride upon it; And thou dissolvest me in the storm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, And to the house appointed for all living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Howbeit doth not one stretch out the hand in his fall? Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? Was not my soul grieved for the needy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">When I looked for good, then evil came; And when I waited for light, there came darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">My heart is troubled, and resteth not; Days of affliction are come upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">I go mourning without the sun: I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">I am a brother to jackals, And a companion to ostriches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">My skin is black, and falleth from me, And my bones are burned with heat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Therefore is my harp turned to mourning, And my pipe into the voice of them that weep.</p>
