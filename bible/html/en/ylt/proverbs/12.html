<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="12" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Whoso is loving instruction, is loving knowledge, And whoso is hating reproof is brutish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The good bringeth forth favour from Jehovah, And the man of wicked devices He condemneth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A man is not established by wickedness, And the root of the righteous is not moved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband, And as rottenness in his bones is one causing shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The thoughts of the righteous are justice, The counsels of the wicked—deceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The words of the wicked are: ‘Lay wait for blood,’ And the mouth of the upright delivereth them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Overthrow the wicked, and they are not, And the house of the righteous standeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">According to his wisdom is a man praised, And the perverted of heart becometh despised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Better is the lightly esteemed who hath a servant, Than the self-honoured who lacketh bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The righteous knoweth the life of his beast, And the mercies of the wicked are cruel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Whoso is tilling the ground is satisfied with bread, And whoso is pursuing vanities is lacking heart,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The wicked hath desired the net of evil doers, And the root of the righteous giveth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">In transgression of the lips is the snare of the wicked, And the righteous goeth out from distress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">From the fruit of the mouth is one satisfied with good, And the deed of man’s hands returneth to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, And whoso is hearkening to counsel is wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The fool—in a day is his anger known, And the prudent is covering shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Whoso uttereth faithfulness declareth righteousness, And a false witness—deceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">A rash speaker is like piercings of a sword, And the tongue of the wise is healing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The lip of truth is established for ever, And for a moment—a tongue of falsehood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Deceit is in the heart of those devising evil, And to those counselling peace is joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">No iniquity is desired by the righteous, And the wicked have been full of evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">An abomination to Jehovah are lying lips, And stedfast doers are his delight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">A prudent man is concealing knowledge, And the heart of fools proclaimeth folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The hand of the diligent ruleth, And slothfulness becometh tributary.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Sorrow in the heart of a man boweth down, And a good word maketh him glad.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The righteous searcheth his companion, And the way of the wicked causeth them to err.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The slothful roasteth not his hunting, And the wealth of a diligent man is precious.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">In the path of righteousness is life, And in the way of that path is no death!</p>
