<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Even to-day is my complaint rebellious: My stroke is heavier than my groaning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Oh that I knew where I might find him! That I might come even to his seat!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I would set my cause in order before him, And fill my mouth with arguments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I would know the words which he would answer me, And understand what he would say unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? Nay; but he would give heed unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">There the upright might reason with him; So should I be delivered for ever from my judge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; And backward, but I cannot perceive him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">On the left hand, when he doth work, but I cannot behold him; He hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But he knoweth the way that I take; When he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My foot hath held fast to his steps; His way have I kept, and turned not aside.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? And what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For he performeth that which is appointed for me: And many such things are with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Therefore am I terrified at his presence; When I consider, I am afraid of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For God hath made my heart faint, And the Almighty hath terrified me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Because I was not cut off before the darkness, Neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.</p>
