  <verse number="1">Then Jesus, six days before the pascha, came to Bethany, where was Lazarus the dead, whom he raised from the dead.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Then made they him a supper there, and Martha served; and Lazarus was one of them reclining at table with him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then Mary having taken a pound of perfumed oil of spikenard, very precious, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hairs: and the house was filled with the smell of the perfumed oil.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then says one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, of Simon, being about to deliver him up,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Wherefore was not this perfumed oil sold for three hundred drachmas, and given to the poor?</verse>
  <verse number="6">And this he said, not that care was to him for the poor: but because he was a thief, and had the small coffer, and carried things deposited.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then said Jesus, Let her go; for the day of my interment has she kept this.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For the poor have ye always with you; and me ye have not always.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then a great crowd of Jews knew that he is there: and they came not for Jesus alone, but that also they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the chief priests took counsel that they might also kill Lazarus;</verse>
  <verse number="11">Because many for him retired, and believed in Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The morrow a great crowd, having come to the festival, having heard that Jesus comes to Jerusalem,</verse>
  <verse number="13">Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to the meeting to him, and cried, Praised he coming in the name of the Lord, King of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Jesus having found a small ass, sat upon it; as it is written,</verse>
  <verse number="15">Fear not, O daughter of Sion: behold, thy King comes, sitting upon the foal of an ass.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And these the disciples knew not at first: but when Jesus was honoured, then remembered they that these were written of him, and they did these things to him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The crowd therefore testified which being with him, that he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And for this the crowd met him, for they heard he had done this sign.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Then said the Pharisees among themselves, Ye see that ye aid nothing; behold, the world has departed after him.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And there were certain Greeks of those going up that they might worship in the festival:</verse>
  <verse number="21">These then came to Philip, him of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Lord, we wish to see Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Philip comes and says to Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip say to Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour has come, that the Son of man should be honoured.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Truly, truly, I say to you, except a kernel of wheat, having fallen into the earth, should die, it remains alone: and if it should die, it brings forth much fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="25">He loving his soul shall lose it; but he hating his soul in this world, shall guard it for life eternal.</verse>
  <verse number="26">If any one would serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there also shall be my servant: and if any one serve me, him will the Father honour.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Now has my soul been troubled; and what should I say? O Father, save me from this hour: but for this came I to this hour.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Father, honour thy name. Then came a voice from heaven, I have also honoured, and will again honour.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Then the crowd, having stood and heard, said it was thunder: others said, A messenger has spoken to him.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Jesus answered and said, This voice has not been for me, but for you.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the ruler of this world be cast out.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all to myself.</verse>
  <verse number="33">This said he, signifying what death he was about to die.</verse>
  <verse number="34">The crowd answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ remains forever: and how sayest thou That the Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</verse>
  <verse number="35">Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little time the light is with you. Walk while ye have light, lest darkness overtake you: and he walking in darkness knows not where he retires.</verse>
  <verse number="36">While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye might be the sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and having departed, he was hid from them.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And he having done so many signs before them, they did not believe in him:</verse>
  <verse number="38">That the word of Esaias the prophet might be completed, which he spake, Lord, who believed our report? and to whom was the arm of the Lord revealed?</verse>
  <verse number="39">Therefore they could not believe, for Esaias said again,</verse>
  <verse number="40">He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart: lest they see with the eyes, and understand with the heart, and should turn back, and I should heal them.</verse>
  <verse number="41">These said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</verse>
  <verse number="42">Yet nevertheless also many of the rulers believed in him; but on account of the Pharisees they did not acknowledge, lest they should be excluded from the synagogue:</verse>
  <verse number="43">For they loved the honour of men more than the honour of God.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Jesus cried and said, He believing in me, believes not in me, but in him having sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And he seeing me, sees him having sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="46">I have come a light into the world, that every one believing in me should not remain in darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And if any hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world.</verse>
  <verse number="48">He rejecting me, and not receiving my words, has him judging him: the word which I spake, that shall judge him in the last day.</verse>
  <verse number="49">For I spake not of myself; but the Father having sent me, he gave me a command, what I should say, and what I should speak.</verse>
  <verse number="50">And I know that his command is life eternal: therefore what I speak, as the Father said to me, so I speak.</verse>
