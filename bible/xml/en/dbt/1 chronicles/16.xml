  <verse number="1">And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had spread for it; and they presented burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And when David had ended offering up the burnt-offerings and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread and a measure [of wine] and a raisin-cake.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he appointed certain of the Levites to do the service before the ark of Jehovah, and to celebrate, and to thank and praise Jehovah the God of Israel:</verse>
  <verse number="5">Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with instruments of lutes and with harps; and Asaph sounding with cymbals;</verse>
  <verse number="6">and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then on that day David delivered first [this psalm] to give thanks to Jehovah through Asaph and his brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known his acts among the peoples.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him; Meditate upon all his wondrous works.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Glory in his holy name: Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Seek Jehovah and his strength, Seek his face continually;</verse>
  <verse number="12">Remember his wondrous works which he hath done; His miracles, and the judgments of his mouth:</verse>
  <verse number="13">Ye seed of Israel his servant, Ye sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He, Jehovah, is our God; His judgments are in all the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Be ye ever mindful of his covenant, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,—</verse>
  <verse number="16">Which he made with Abraham, And of his oath unto Isaac;</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he confirmed it unto Jacob for a statute, Unto Israel for an everlasting covenant,</verse>
  <verse number="18">Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;</verse>
  <verse number="19">When ye were a few men in number, Of small account, and strangers in it.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And they went from nation to nation, And from one kingdom to another people.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He suffered no man to oppress them, And reproved kings for their sakes,</verse>
  <verse number="22">[Saying,] Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth; Publish his salvation from day to day.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Declare his glory among the nations, His wondrous works among all peoples.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For Jehovah is great, and exceedingly to be praised; And he is terrible above all gods.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For all the gods of the peoples are idols; But Jehovah made the heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Majesty and splendour are before him; Strength and gladness in his place.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Give unto Jehovah, ye families of peoples, Give unto Jehovah glory and strength!</verse>
  <verse number="29">Give unto Jehovah the glory of his name! Bring an oblation, and come before him: Worship Jehovah in holy splendour.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Tremble before him, all the earth: The world also is established, it shall not be moved.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; And let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth!</verse>
  <verse number="32">Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; Let the field exult, and all that is therein.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Then shall the trees of the forest sing out at the presence of Jehovah, For he cometh to judge the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Give thanks unto Jehovah, for he is good; For his loving-kindness [endureth] for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And say, Save us, O God of our salvation, And gather us, and deliver us from the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, To triumph in thy praise.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Blessed be Jehovah the God of Israel, from eternity and to eternity! And all the people said, Amen! and praised Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, Asaph and his brethren, to do the service before the ark continually, as every day’s duty required;</verse>
  <verse number="38">and Obed-Edom, and their brethren, sixty-eight; Obed-Edom also, the son of Jeduthun, and Hosah as doorkeepers.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah in the high place that was at Gibeon,</verse>
  <verse number="40">to offer up burnt-offerings to Jehovah on the altar of burnt-offering continually, morning and evening, and according to all that is written in the law of Jehovah, which he commanded Israel;</verse>
  <verse number="41">and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to Jehovah, because his loving-kindness [endureth] for ever;</verse>
  <verse number="42">and with them, [with] Heman and Jeduthun, trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud; and the musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were at the gate.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And all the people departed every one to his house; and David returned to bless his household.</verse>
