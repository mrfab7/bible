  <verse number="1">These things spake Jesus; and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that the Son may glorify thee:</verse>
  <verse number="2">even as thou gavest him authority over all flesh, that whatsoever thou hast given him, to them he should give eternal life.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And this is life eternal, that they should know thee the only true God, and him whom thou didst send, even Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I glorified thee on the earth, having accomplished the work which thou hast given me to do.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I manifested thy name unto the men whom thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them to me; and they have kept thy word.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now they know that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are from thee:</verse>
  <verse number="8">for the words which thou gavest me I have given unto them; and they received them, and knew of a truth that I came forth from thee, and they believed that thou didst send me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me; for they are thine:</verse>
  <verse number="10">and all things that are mine are thine, and thine are mine: and I am glorified in them.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And I am no more in the world, and these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep them in thy name which thou hast given me, that they may be one, even as we are.</verse>
  <verse number="12">While I was with them, I kept them in thy name which thou hast given me: and I guarded them, and not one of them perished, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I have given them thy word; and the world hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I pray not that thou shouldest take them from the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil one.</verse>
  <verse number="16">They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Sanctify them in the truth: thy word is truth.</verse>
  <verse number="18">As thou didst send me into the world, even so sent I them into the world.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they themselves also may be sanctified in truth.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Neither for these only do I pray, but for them also that believe on me through their word;</verse>
  <verse number="21">that they may all be one; even as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us: that the world may believe that thou didst send me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the glory which thou hast given me I have given unto them; that they may be one, even as we are one;</verse>
  <verse number="23">I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one; that the world may know that thou didst send me, and lovedst them, even as thou lovedst me.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Father, that which thou hast given me, I will that, where I am, they also may be with me; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="25">O righteous Father, the world knew thee not, but I knew thee; and these knew that thou didst send me;</verse>
  <verse number="26">and I made known unto them thy name, and will make it known; that the love wherewith thou lovedst me may be in them, and I in them.</verse>
