<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“Man, who is born of a woman, is of few days, and full of trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">He comes forth like a flower, and is cut down. He also flees like a shadow, and doesn’t continue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Do you open your eyes on such a one, and bring me into judgment with you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months is with you, and you have appointed his bounds that he can’t pass;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Look away from him, that he may rest, until he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">“For there is hope for a tree, If it is cut down, that it will sprout again, that the tender branch of it will not cease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Though its root grows old in the earth, and its stock dies in the ground,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">yet through the scent of water it will bud, and put forth boughs like a plant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But man dies, and is laid low. Yes, man gives up the spirit, and where is he?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">As the waters fail from the sea, and the river wastes and dries up,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">so man lies down and doesn’t rise. Until the heavens are no more, they shall not awake, nor be roused out of their sleep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">“Oh that you would hide me in Sheol, that you would keep me secret, until your wrath is past, that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my warfare would I wait, until my release should come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">You would call, and I would answer you. You would have a desire to the work of your hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But now you number my steps. Don’t you watch over my sin?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">My disobedience is sealed up in a bag. You fasten up my iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">“But the mountain falling comes to nothing. The rock is removed out of its place;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The waters wear the stones. The torrents of it wash away the dust of the earth. So you destroy the hope of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">You forever prevail against him, and he departs. You change his face, and send him away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His sons come to honor, and he doesn’t know it. They are brought low, but he doesn’t perceive it of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But his flesh on him has pain, and his soul within him mourns.”</p>
