<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="33" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“However, Job, please hear my speech, and listen to all my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">See now, I have opened my mouth. My tongue has spoken in my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart. That which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If you can, answer me. Set your words in order before me, and stand forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Behold, I am toward God even as you are. I am also formed out of the clay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, my terror shall not make you afraid, neither shall my pressure be heavy on you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">“Surely you have spoken in my hearing, I have heard the voice of your words, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">‘I am clean, without disobedience. I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Behold, he finds occasions against me. He counts me for his enemy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He puts my feet in the stocks. He marks all my paths.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">“Behold, I will answer you. In this you are not just, for God is greater than man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Why do you strive against him, because he doesn’t give account of any of his matters?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For God speaks once, yes twice, though man pays no attention.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, in slumbering on the bed;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Then he opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He keeps back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He is chastened also with pain on his bed, with continual strife in his bones;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">So that his life abhors bread, and his soul dainty food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His flesh is so consumed away, that it can’t be seen. His bones that were not seen stick out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Yes, his soul draws near to the pit, and his life to the destroyers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">“If there is beside him an angel, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man what is right for him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">then God is gracious to him, and says, ‘Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s. He returns to the days of his youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He prays to God, and he is favorable to him, so that he sees his face with joy. He restores to man his righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He sings before men, and says, ‘I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it didn’t profit me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He has redeemed my soul from going into the pit. My life shall see the light.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">“Behold, God works all these things, twice, yes three times, with a man,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Mark well, Job, and listen to me. Hold your peace, and I will speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">If you have anything to say, answer me. Speak, for I desire to justify you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If not, listen to me. Hold your peace, and I will teach you wisdom.”</p>
