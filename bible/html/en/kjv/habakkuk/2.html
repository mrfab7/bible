<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make [it] plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the vision [is] yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Behold, his soul [which] is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, [he is] a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and [is] as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth [that which is] not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men’s blood, and [for] the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned [against] thy soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Behold, [is it] not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to [him], and makest [him] drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD’S right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing [shall be] on thy glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, [which] made them afraid, because of men’s blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it [is] laid over with gold and silver, and [there is] no breath at all in the midst of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But the LORD [is] in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.</p>
