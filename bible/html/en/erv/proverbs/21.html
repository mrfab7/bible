<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD weigheth the hearts.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The violence of the wicked shall sweep them away; because they refuse to do judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The way of him that is laden with guilt is exceeding crooked: but as for the pure, his work is right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a contentious woman in a wide house.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall rest in the congregation of the dead.</p>
