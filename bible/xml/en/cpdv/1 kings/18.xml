  <verse number="1">After many days, the word of the Lord came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, “Go and show yourself to Ahab, so that I may grant rain upon the face of the earth.”</verse>
  <verse number="2">Therefore, Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. For there was a severe famine in Samaria.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Ahab called Obadiah, the manager of his household. Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For when Jezebel was killing the prophets of the Lord, he took one hundred prophets, and concealed them, fifty and fifty, in caves. And he fed them with bread and water.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go into the land, to all fountains of water, and to all the valleys, for perhaps we will be able to find plants, and save the horses and mules, so that the beasts of burden may not perish entirely.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">And they divided the regions among themselves, so that they might travel through them. Ahab went one way alone, and Obadiah went another way by himself.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And while Obadiah was on the way, Elijah met him. And when he had recognized him, he fell on his face, and he said, “Are you not my lord Elijah?”</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he responded to him: “I am. Go and tell your lord that Elijah is here.”</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he said: “How have I sinned that you would deliver me, your servant, into the hand of Ahab, so that he would put me to death?</verse>
  <verse number="10">As the Lord your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom to which my lord has not sent, seeking you. And when all responded, ‘He is not here,’ he swore each kingdom and nation to an oath, because you were not found at all.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And now, you say to me, ‘Go and tell your lord that Elijah is here.’</verse>
  <verse number="12">And when I will have departed from you, the Spirit of the Lord will transport you to a place that I do not know. And entering, I will report to Ahab. And he, not finding you, will put me to death. Yet your servant has feared the Lord from his infancy.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Has it not been revealed to you, my lord, what I did when Jezebel was killing the prophets of the Lord: how I hid one hundred men from the prophets of the Lord, fifty and fifty, in caves, and how I fed them with bread and water?</verse>
  <verse number="14">And now you say: ‘Go and tell your lord that Elijah is here,’ so that he may kill me!”</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Elijah said, “As the Lord of hosts lives, before whose face I stand, this day I will appear to him.”</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore, Obadiah went away to meet Ahab, and he reported to him. And Ahab went to meet Elijah.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And when he had seen him, he said, “Are you the one who is disturbing Israel?”</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he said: “I have not troubled Israel. But it is you, and the house of your father, who have abandoned the commandments of the Lord, and have followed the Baals.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Yet truly now, send and gather to me all of Israel, on Mount Carmel, with the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal, and the four hundred prophets of the sacred groves, who eat from the table of Jezebel.”</verse>
  <verse number="20">Ahab sent to all the sons of Israel, and he gathered together the prophets on mount Carmel.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then Elijah, drawing near to all the people, said: “How long will you waver between two sides? If the Lord is God, follow him. But if Baal is, then follow him.” And the people did not respond a word to him.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Elijah said again to the people: “I alone remain as a prophet of the Lord. But the prophets of Baal are four hundred and fifty men.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Let two oxen be given to us. And let them choose one ox for themselves, and, cutting it into pieces, let them set it on the wood. But they may not place fire under it. And I will prepare the other ox, and set it on the wood. But I will not place fire under it.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Call upon the names of your gods. And I will call on the name of my Lord. And the God who will have heeded with fire, let him be God.” And in response, all the people said, “Excellent proposition.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal: “Choose for yourselves one ox, and prepare it first. For you are many. And call on the names of your gods, but do not place fire under it.”</verse>
  <verse number="26">And when they had taken an ox, which he had given to them, they prepared it. And they called on the name of Baal, from morning even until midday, saying, “O Baal, heed us.” And there was no voice, nor did anyone respond. And so they leaped upon the altar that they had made.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And when it was now midday, Elijah ridiculed them, saying: “Cry out with a louder voice. For he is a god, and perhaps he is talking, or at an inn, or on a journey, or certainly he may be asleep, and must be awakened.”</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then they cried out with a loud voice, and they cut themselves, in accord with their ritual, with knives and lancets, until they were entirely covered in blood.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Then, after midday had passed, and they were prophesying, the time had arrived when the sacrifice is usually offered. And there was no voice heard, neither did anyone heed or respond to the praying.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Elijah said to all the people, “Draw near to me.” And as the people were drawing near to him, he repaired the altar of the Lord, which had been torn down.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And he took twelve stones, in accord with the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the Lord came, saying, “Israel shall be your name.”</verse>
  <verse number="32">And he built from the stones an altar to the name of the Lord. And he made a trench for water, like two furrows of plowed land, all around the altar.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And he arranged the wood, and he cut the ox into pieces, and he placed it on the wood.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And he said, “Fill four containers with water, and pour it over the holocaust, and over the wood.” And again, he said, “Do this a second time.” And when they had done it a second time, he said, “Do it also a third time.” And they did so a third time.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the water was running down around the altar, and the pit of the trench was filled with water.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And when it was now time for the holocaust to be offered, the prophet Elijah, drawing near, said: “O Lord, God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Israel, reveal this day that you are the God of Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have acted, in all these things, in accord with your precept.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Heed me, O Lord, heed me, so that this people may learn that you are the Lord God, and that you have converted their heart again.”</verse>
  <verse number="38">Then the fire of the Lord fell down and devoured the holocaust, and the wood, and the stones, and even the dust, and it absorbed the water that was in the trench.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And when all the people had seen it, they fell upon their face, and they said: “The Lord himself is God! The Lord himself is God!”</verse>
  <verse number="40">And Elijah said to them, “Apprehend the prophets of Baal, and do not let even one of them escape.” And when they had apprehended them, Elijah led them down to the torrent Kishon, and he put them to death there.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And Elijah said to Ahab “Ascend; eat and drink. For there is the sound of an abundance of rain.”</verse>
  <verse number="42">Ahab ascended, so that he might eat and drink. But Elijah ascended to the top of Carmel, and bending down to the ground, he placed his face between his knees.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And he said to his servant, “Ascend, and gaze out toward the sea.” And when he had ascended, and had contemplated, he said, “There is nothing.” And again, he said to him, “Return seven times.”</verse>
  <verse number="44">And at the seventh time, behold, a little cloud ascended from the sea like the footstep of a man. And he said: “Ascend, and say to Ahab, ‘Yoke your chariot, and descend; otherwise, the rain may prevent you.’ ”</verse>
  <verse number="45">And as he was turning himself this way and that, behold, the heavens were darkened, and there were clouds and wind, and a great rainstorm occurred. And so Ahab, going up, went away to Jezreel.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And the hand of the Lord was upon Elijah. And cinching his waist, he ran before Ahab, until he arrived at Jezreel.</verse>
