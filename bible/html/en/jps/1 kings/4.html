<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking and making merry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt; they brought presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and threescore measures of meal;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and a hundred sheep, beside harts, and gazelles, and roebucks, and fatted fowl.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For he had dominion over all the region on this side the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on this side the River; and he had peace on all sides round about him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and under his fig-tree, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, all the days of Solomon.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month; they let nothing be lacking.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds brought they unto the place where it should be, every man according to his charge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea-shore.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of the east, and all the wisdom of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For he was wiser than all men: than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, and Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was in all the nations round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And he spoke three thousand proverbs; and his songs were a thousand and five.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And he spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall; he spoke also of beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And there came of all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.</p>
