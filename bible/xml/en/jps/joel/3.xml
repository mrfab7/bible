  <verse number="1">For, behold, in those days, and in that time, When I shall bring back the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,</verse>
  <verse number="2">I will gather all nations, And will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; And I will enter into judgment with them there For My people and for My heritage Israel, Whom they have scattered among the nations, And divided My land.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And they have cast lots for My people; And have given a boy for an harlot, And sold a girl for wine, and have drunk.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And also what are ye to Me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the regions of Philistia? will ye render retribution on My behalf? and if ye render retribution on My behalf, swiftly, speedily will I return your retribution upon your own head.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Forasmuch as ye have taken My silver and My gold, and have carried into your temples My goodly treasures;</verse>
  <verse number="6">the children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto the sons of Jevanim, that ye might remove them far from their border;</verse>
  <verse number="7">behold, I will stir them up out of the place whither ye have sold them, and will return your retribution upon your own head;</verse>
  <verse number="8">and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the men of Sheba, to a nation far off; for the LORD hath spoken.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Proclaim ye this among the nations, Prepare war; Stir up the mighty men; Let all the men of war draw near, Let them come up.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Beat your plowshares into swords, And your pruning-hooks into spears; Let the weak say: ‘I am strong.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">Haste ye, and come, all ye nations round about, And gather yourselves together; Thither cause Thy mighty ones to come down, O LORD!</verse>
  <verse number="12">Let the nations be stirred up, and come up To the valley of Jehoshaphat; For there will I sit to judge All the nations round about.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Put ye in the sickle, For the harvest is ripe; Come, tread ye, For the winepress is full, the vats overflow; For their wickedness is great.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The sun and the moon are become black, And the stars withdraw their shining.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the LORD shall roar from Zion, And utter His voice from Jerusalem, And the heavens and the earth shall shake; But the LORD will be a refuge unto His people, And a stronghold to the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="17">So shall ye know that I am the LORD your God, Dwelling in Zion My holy mountain; Then shall Jerusalem be holy, And there shall no strangers pass through her any more.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And it shall come to pass in that day, That the mountains shall drop down sweet wine, And the hills shall flow with milk, And all the brooks of Judah shall flow with waters; And a fountain shall come forth of the house of the LORD, And shall water the valley of Shittim.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Egypt shall be a desolation, And Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, For the violence against the children of Judah, Because they have shed innocent blood in their land.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But Judah shall be inhabited for ever, And Jerusalem from generation to generation.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And I will hold as innocent their blood that I have not held as innocent; And the LORD dwelleth in Zion.</verse>
