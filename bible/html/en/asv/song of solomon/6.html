<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? Whither hath thy beloved turned him, That we may seek him with thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">My beloved is gone down to his garden, To the beds of spices, To feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I am my belovedâ€™s, and my beloved is mine: He feedeth his flock among the lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thou art fair, O my love, as Tirzah, Comely as Jerusalem, Terrible as an army with banners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Turn away thine eyes from me, For they have overcome me. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, That lie along the side of Gilead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thy teeth are like a flock of ewes, Which are come up from the washing; Whereof every one hath twins, And none is bereaved among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate Behind thy veil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, And virgins without number.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">My dove, my undefiled, is but one; She is the only one of her mother; She is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and called her blessed; Yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, Fair as the moon, Clear as the sun, Terrible as an army with banners?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I went down into the garden of nuts, To see the green plants of the valley, To see whether the vine budded, And the pomegranates were in flower.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Before I was aware, my soul set me Among the chariots of my princely people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Return, return, O Shulammite; Return, return, that we may look upon thee. Why will ye look upon the Shulammite, As upon the dance of Mahanaim?</p>
