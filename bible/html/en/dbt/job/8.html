<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How long wilt thou speak these things? and the words of thy mouth be a strong wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Doth God pervert judgment, and the Almighty pervert justice?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If thy children have sinned against him, he hath also given them over into the hand of their transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If thou seek earnestly unto God, and make thy supplication to the Almighty,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If thou be pure and upright, surely now he will awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And though thy beginning was small, yet thine end shall be very great.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For inquire, I pray thee, of the former generation, and attend to the researches of their fathers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For we are [but] of yesterday, and know nothing, for our days upon earth are a shadow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Shall not they teach thee, [and] tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Doth the papyrus shoot up without mire? doth the reed-grass grow without water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Whilst it is yet in its greenness [and] not cut down, it withereth before any [other] grass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">So are the paths of all that forget God; and the profane man’s hope shall perish,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Whose confidence shall be cut off, and his reliance is a spider’s web.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He shall lean upon his house, and it shall not stand; he shall lay hold on it, but it shall not endure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He is full of sap before the sun, and his sprout shooteth forth over his garden;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">His roots are entwined about the stoneheap; he seeth the place of stones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him: I have not seen thee!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the dust shall others grow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Behold, God will not cast off a perfect man, neither will he take evil-doers by the hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Whilst he would fill thy mouth with laughing and thy lips with shouting,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked be no more.</p>
