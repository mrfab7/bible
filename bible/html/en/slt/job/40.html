<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah will answer Job, and he will say,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Shall he contending with the Almighty, instruct? he reproving God shall answer it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Job will answer Jehovah, and say,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Behold, I was vile; what shall I turn back to thee? I put my hand to my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Once I sake, and I will not answer: and twice, and I will not add.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Jehovah will answer Job from the whirlwind, and he will say,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Gird up now thy loins as a man; I will ask thee, and do thou make known to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Wilt thou also annul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me so that thou shalt be just?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And if an arm to thee as God? and with thy voice wilt thou thunder as he?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Deck thyself now with majesty and grandeur, and thou shalt put on ornament and splendor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Scatter the overflowings of thine anger, and see every proud one and bring him low.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">See every proud one, and humble him; and crush the unjust in their place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hide them in the dust together, and bind their faces in hiding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And also I will confess to thee that thy right hand shall save for thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold now, the great beast which I made with thee; he will eat grass as an ox.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Behold now, his strength in his loins, and his power in the sinews of his belly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He will bend his tail as a cedar; the sinews of his thighs will be woven together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">His bones tubes of brass; his bones as a hammered bar of iron.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He the chief of the ways of God: he making him, his sword will reach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For the mountains shall lift up produce for him, and all the beasts of the field shall play there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He will lie down under the shades, in the covering of the reed and marsh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The shades shall cover him with their shadow; the willows of the torrent shall surround him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Behold, he will oppress a river, and he will not spring up: he will trust that Jordan burst forth into his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He will take it with his eyes: his nose will pierce through snares.</p>
