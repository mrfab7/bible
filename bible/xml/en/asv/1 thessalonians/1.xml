  <verse number="1">Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.</verse>
  <verse number="2">We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;</verse>
  <verse number="3">remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father;</verse>
  <verse number="4">knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election,</verse>
  <verse number="5">how that our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance; even as ye know what manner of men we showed ourselves toward you for your sake.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And ye became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="7">so that ye became an ensample to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For from you hath sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith to God-ward is gone forth; so that we need not to speak anything.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering in we had unto you; and how ye turned unto God from idols, to serve a living and true God,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, who delivereth us from the wrath to come.</verse>
