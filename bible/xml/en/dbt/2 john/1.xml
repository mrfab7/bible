  <verse number="1">The elder to [the] elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not I only but also all who have known the truth,</verse>
  <verse number="2">for the truth’s sake which abides in us and shall be with us to eternity.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Grace shall be with you, mercy, peace from God [the] Father, and from [the] Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I rejoiced greatly that I have found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received commandment from the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And now I beseech thee, lady, not as writing to thee a new commandment, but that which we have had from [the] beginning, that we should love one another.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And this is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, according as ye have heard from the beginning, that ye might walk in it.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For many deceivers have gone out into the world, they who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in flesh—this is the deceiver and the antichrist.</verse>
  <verse number="8">See to yourselves, that we may not lose what we have wrought, but may receive full wages.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Whosoever goes forward and abides not in the doctrine of the Christ has not God. He that abides in the doctrine, he has both the Father and the Son.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If any one come to you and bring not this doctrine, do not receive him into [the] house, and greet him not;</verse>
  <verse number="11">for he who greets him partakes in his wicked works.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Having many things to write to you, I would not with paper and ink; but hope to come to you, and to speak mouth to mouth, that our joy may be full.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The children of thine elect sister greet thee.</verse>
