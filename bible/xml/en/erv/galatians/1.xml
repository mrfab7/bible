<chapter book="Galatians" number="1" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),</verse>
  <verse number="2">and all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
  <verse number="4">who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father:</verse>
  <verse number="5">to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel;</verse>
  <verse number="7">which is not another gospel: only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema.</verse>
  <verse number="9">As we have said before, so say I now again, If any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be anathema.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For am I now persuading men, or God? or am I seeking to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havock of it:</verse>
  <verse number="14">and I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, even from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace,</verse>
  <verse number="16">to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:</verse>
  <verse number="17">neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord’s brother.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Now touching the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And I was still unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="23">but they only heard say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havock;</verse>
  <verse number="24">and they glorified God in me.</verse>
