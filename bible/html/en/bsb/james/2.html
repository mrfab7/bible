<div class="chapter" data-book="James" data-chapter="2" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My brothers, as you hold out your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, do not show favoritism.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If you lavish attention on the man in fine clothes and say, “Here is a seat of honor,” but say to the poor man, “You must stand” or “Sit at my feet,”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Listen, my beloved brothers: Has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom He promised those who love Him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But you have dishonored the poor. Is it not the rich who oppress you and drag you into court?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Are they not the ones who blaspheme the noble name by which you have been called?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">If you really fulfill the royal law stated in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Whoever keeps the whole law but stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For He who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” If you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful. Mercy triumphs over judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What good is it, my brothers, if someone claims to have faith, but has no deeds? Can such faith save him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If one of you tells him, “Go in peace; stay warm and well fed,” but does not provide for his physical needs, what good is that?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">So too, faith by itself, if it does not result in action, is dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But someone will say, “You have faith and I have deeds.” Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">You believe that God is one. Good for you! Even the demons believe that—and shudder.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">O foolish man, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is worthless?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Was not our father Abraham justified by what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">You see that his faith was working with his actions, and his faith was perfected by what he did.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And the Scripture was fulfilled that says, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness,” and he was called a friend of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">As you can see, a man is justified by his deeds and not by faith alone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute justified by her actions when she welcomed the spies and sent them off on another route?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.</p>
