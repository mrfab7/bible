<chapter book="Song of Solomon" number="3" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">On my couch by night, I sought him whom my soul hath loved; I sought him, and I found him not!</verse>
  <verse number="2">—Pray, let me rise, and go round the city, In the streets and in the broad places, I seek him whom my soul hath loved!—I sought him, and I found him not.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The watchmen have found me, (Who are going round about the city), ‘Him whom my soul have loved saw ye?’</verse>
  <verse number="4">But a little I passed on from them, Till I found him whom my soul hath loved! I seized him, and let him not go, Till I brought him in unto the house of my mother—And the chamber of her that conceived me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I have adjured you, daughters of Jerusalem, By the roes or by the hinds of the field, Stir not up nor wake the love till she please!</verse>
  <verse number="6">Who is this coming up from the wilderness, Like palm-trees of smoke, Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, From every powder of the merchant?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Lo, his couch, that is Solomon’s, Sixty mighty ones are around it, Of the mighty of Israel,</verse>
  <verse number="8">All of them holding sword, taught of battle, Each his sword by his thigh, for fear at night.</verse>
  <verse number="9">A palanquin king Solomon made for himself, Of the wood of Lebanon,</verse>
  <verse number="10">Its pillars he made of silver, Its bottom of gold, its seat of purple, Its midst lined with love, By the daughters of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Go forth, and look, ye daughters of Zion, On king Solomon, with the crown, With which his mother crowned him, In the day of his espousals, And in the day of the joy of his heart!</verse>
