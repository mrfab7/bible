  <verse number="1">On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and Jesus and His disciples had also been invited to the wedding.</verse>
  <verse number="3">When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to Him, “They have no more wine.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">“Woman, what is that to you and to Me?” Jesus replied. “My hour has not yet come.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever He tells you.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now six stone water jars had been set there for the Jewish rites of purification. Each could hold from twenty to thirty gallons.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Jesus told the servants, “Fill the jars with water.” So they filled them to the brim.</verse>
  <verse number="8">“Now draw some out,” He said, “and take it to the master of the banquet.” They did so,</verse>
  <verse number="9">and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine. He did not know where it was from, but the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside</verse>
  <verse number="10">and said, “Everyone serves the fine wine first, and then the cheap wine after the guests are drunk. But you have saved the fine wine until now!”</verse>
  <verse number="11">Jesus performed this, the first of His signs, at Cana in Galilee. He thus revealed His glory, and His disciples believed in Him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">After this, He went down to Capernaum with His mother and brothers and His disciples, and they stayed there a few days.</verse>
  <verse number="13">When the Jewish Passover was near, Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="14">In the temple courts He found men selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and money changers seated at their tables.</verse>
  <verse number="15">So He made a whip out of cords and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle. He poured out the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.</verse>
  <verse number="16">To those selling doves He said, “Get these out of here! How dare you turn My Father’s house into a marketplace!”</verse>
  <verse number="17">His disciples remembered that it is written: “Zeal for Your house will consume Me.”</verse>
  <verse number="18">On account of this, the Jews demanded, “What sign can You show us to prove Your authority to do these things?”</verse>
  <verse number="19">Jesus answered, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again.”</verse>
  <verse number="20">“This temple took forty-six years to build,” the Jews replied, “and You are going to raise it up in three days?”</verse>
  <verse number="21">But Jesus was speaking about the temple of His body.</verse>
  <verse number="22">After He was raised from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this. Then they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.</verse>
  <verse number="23">While He was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many people saw the signs He was doing and believed in His name.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But Jesus did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew them all.</verse>
  <verse number="25">He did not need any testimony about man, for He knew what was in a man.</verse>
