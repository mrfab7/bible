<p class="verse" data-verse="1">In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, and His train filled the temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Above Him stood the seraphim; each one had six wings: with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And one called unto another, and said: Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts; The whole earth is full of His glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the posts of the door were moved at the voice of them that called, and the house was filled with smoke.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then said I: Woe is me! for I am undone; Because I am a man of unclean lips, And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; For mine eyes have seen the King, The LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then flew unto me one of the seraphim, with a glowing stone in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and he touched my mouth with it, and said: Lo, this hath touched thy lips; And thine iniquity is taken away, And thy sin expiated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: Whom shall I send, And who will go for us? Then I said: ‘Here am I; send me.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And He said: ‘Go, and tell this people: Hear ye indeed, but understand not; And see ye indeed, but perceive not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Make the heart of this people fat, And make their ears heavy, And shut their eyes; Lest they, seeing with their eyes, And hearing with their ears, And understanding with their heart, Return, and be healed.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Then said I: ‘Lord, how long?’ And He answered: ‘Until cities be waste without inhabitant, And houses without man, And the land become utterly waste,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the LORD have removed men far away, And the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And if there be yet a tenth in it, it shall again be eaten up; as a terebinth, and as an oak, whose stock remaineth, when they cast their leaves, so the holy seed shall be the stock thereof.’</p>
