<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And the one sea and the twelve oxen under the sea;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">And the pots and the shovels and the vases: and all these vessels which Hiram made for king Solomon of the house of Jehovah, of polished brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">In the circuit of Jordan the king cast them, in the density of the earth between Succoth and between Zarthan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">And Solomon will leave all the vessels, an exceeding great multitude: and the weight of the brass was not searched out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">And Solomon will make all the vessels which are for the house of Jehovah: the altar of gold, and the table which was upon it the bread of the face, of gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">And the chandeliers, five from the right, and five from the left, before the oracle, of gold shut up; and the flower, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">And the thresholds, and the snuffers, and the vases, and the pans, and the fire-pans, of gold shut up; and the openings to the doors of the house within to the holy of holies, to the doors of the house to the temple, of gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">And all the work will be completed which king Solomon made for the house of Jehovah. And Solomon will bring in the holy things of David his father: the silver and the gold and the vessels he gave into the treasures of the house of Jehovah.</p>
