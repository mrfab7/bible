  <verse number="1">And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond Jordan;</verse>
  <verse number="2">And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The Pharisees also came to him, tempting him, and saying to him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he answered and said to them, Have you not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,</verse>
  <verse number="5">And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall join to his wife: and they two shall be one flesh?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Why they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man put asunder.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They say to him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorce, and to put her away?</verse>
  <verse number="8">He said to them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And I say to you, Whoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, commits adultery: and whoever marries her which is put away does commit adultery.</verse>
  <verse number="10">His disciples say to him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But he said to them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother’s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then were there brought to him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come to me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he laid his hands on them, and departed there.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And, behold, one came and said to him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he said to him, Why call you me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if you will enter into life, keep the commandments.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He said to him, Which? Jesus said, You shall do no murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness,</verse>
  <verse number="19">Honor your father and your mother: and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The young man said to him, All these things have I kept from my youth up: what lack I yet?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Jesus said to him, If you will be perfect, go and sell that you have, and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Then said Jesus to his disciples, Truly I say to you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="25">When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?</verse>
  <verse number="26">But Jesus beheld them, and said to them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Then answered Peter and said to him, Behold, we have forsaken all, and followed you; what shall we have therefore?</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That you which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And every one that has forsaken houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive an hundred times, and shall inherit everlasting life.</verse>
  <verse number="30">But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be first.</verse>
