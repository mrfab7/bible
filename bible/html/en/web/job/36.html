<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Elihu also continued, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Bear with me a little, and I will show you; for I still have something to say on God’s behalf.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I will get my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For truly my words are not false. One who is perfect in knowledge is with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">“Behold, God is mighty, and doesn’t despise anyone. He is mighty in strength of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He doesn’t preserve the life of the wicked, but gives to the afflicted their right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He doesn’t withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but with kings on the throne, he sets them forever, and they are exalted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">If they are bound in fetters, and are taken in the cords of afflictions,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">then he shows them their work, and their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He also opens their ears to instruction, and commands that they return from iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If they listen and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But if they don’t listen, they shall perish by the sword; they shall die without knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">“But those who are godless in heart lay up anger. They don’t cry for help when he binds them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">They die in youth. Their life perishes among the unclean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He delivers the afflicted by their affliction, and opens their ear in oppression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Yes, he would have allured you out of distress, into a broad place, where there is no restriction. That which is set on your table would be full of fatness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">“But you are full of the judgment of the wicked. Judgment and justice take hold of you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Don’t let riches entice you to wrath, neither let the great size of a bribe turn you aside.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Would your wealth sustain you in distress, or all the might of your strength?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Don’t desire the night, when people are cut off in their place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Take heed, don’t regard iniquity; for you have chosen this rather than affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Behold, God is exalted in his power. Who is a teacher like him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Who has prescribed his way for him? Or who can say, ‘You have committed unrighteousness?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">“Remember that you magnify his work, whereof men have sung.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">All men have looked thereon. Man sees it afar off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Behold, God is great, and we don’t know him. The number of his years is unsearchable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For he draws up the drops of water, which distill in rain from his vapor,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Which the skies pour down and which drop on man abundantly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Yes, can any understand the spreading of the clouds, and the thunderings of his pavilion?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Behold, he spreads his light around him. He covers the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For by these he judges the people. He gives food in abundance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He covers his hands with the lightning, and commands it to strike the mark.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Its noise tells about him, and the livestock also concerning the storm that comes up.</p>
