<chapter book="Hebrews" number="6" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Wherefore leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us go on to things more perfect, not laying again the foundation of penance from dead works, and of faith towards God,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Of the doctrine of baptisms, and imposition of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And this will we do, if God permit.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For it is impossible for those who were once illuminated, have tasted also the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Have moreover tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</verse>
  <verse number="6">And are fallen away: to be renewed again to penance, crucifying again to themselves the Son of God, and making him a mockery.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For the earth that drinketh in the rain which cometh often upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is tilled, receiveth blessing from God.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But that which bringeth forth thorns and briers, is reprobate, and very near unto a curse, whose end is to be burnt.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But, my dearly beloved, we trust better things of you, and nearer to salvation; though we speak thus.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For God is not unjust, that he should forget your work, and the love which you have shewn in his name, you who have ministered, and do minister to the saints.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And we desire that every one of you shew forth the same carefulness to the accomplishing of hope unto the end:</verse>
  <verse number="12">That you become not slothful, but followers of them, who through faith and patience shall inherit the promises.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For God making promise to Abraham, because he had no one greater by whom he might swear, swore by himself,</verse>
  <verse number="14">Saying: Unless blessing I shall bless thee, and multiplying I shall multiply thee.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And so patiently enduring he obtained the promise.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For men swear by one greater than themselves: and an oath for confirmation is the end of all their controversy.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Wherein God, meaning more abundantly to shew to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed an oath:</verse>
  <verse number="18">That by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have the strongest comfort, who have fled for refuge to hold fast the hope set before us.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Which we have as an anchor of the soul, sure and firm, and which entereth in even within the veil;</verse>
  <verse number="20">Where the forerunner Jesus is entered for us, made a high priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech.</verse>
