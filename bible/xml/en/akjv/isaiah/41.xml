<chapter book="Isaiah" number="41" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew their strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let us come near together to judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over kings? he gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven stubble to his bow.</verse>
  <verse number="3">He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he had not gone with his feet.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who has worked and done it, calling the generations from the beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid, drew near, and came.</verse>
  <verse number="6">They helped every one his neighbor; and every one said to his brother, Be of good courage.</verse>
  <verse number="7">So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smoothes with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the soldering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But you, Israel, are my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.</verse>
  <verse number="9">You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called you from the chief men thereof, and said to you, You are my servant; I have chosen you, and not cast you away.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Fear you not; for I am with you: be not dismayed; for I am your God: I will strengthen you; yes, I will help you; yes, I will uphold you with the right hand of my righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Behold, all they that were incensed against you shall be ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they that strive with you shall perish.</verse>
  <verse number="12">You shall seek them, and shall not find them, even them that contended with you: they that war against you shall be as nothing, and as a thing of nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For I the LORD your God will hold your right hand, saying to you, Fear not; I will help you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Fear not, you worm Jacob, and you men of Israel; I will help you, said the LORD, and your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Behold, I will make you a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth: you shall thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and shall make the hills as chaff.</verse>
  <verse number="16">You shall fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them: and you shall rejoice in the LORD, and shall glory in the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="17">When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and their tongue fails for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I the God of Israel will not forsake them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the middle of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water.</verse>
  <verse number="19">I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together:</verse>
  <verse number="20">That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD has done this, and the Holy One of Israel has created it.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Produce your cause, said the LORD; bring forth your strong reasons, said the King of Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Let them bring them forth, and show us what shall happen: let them show the former things, what they be, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us things for to come.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Show the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that you are gods: yes, do good, or do evil, that we may be dismayed, and behold it together.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Behold, you are of nothing, and your work of nothing: an abomination is he that chooses you.</verse>
  <verse number="25">I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from the rising of the sun shall he call on my name: and he shall come on princes as on mortar, and as the potter treads clay.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Who has declared from the beginning, that we may know? and beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? yes, there is none that shows, yes, there is none that declares, yes, there is none that hears your words.</verse>
  <verse number="27">The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will give to Jerusalem one that brings good tidings.</verse>
  <verse number="28">For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there was no counselor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a word.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their molten images are wind and confusion.</verse>
