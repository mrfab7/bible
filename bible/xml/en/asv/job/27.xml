<chapter book="Job" number="27" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And Job again took up his parable, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">As God liveth, who hath taken away my right, And the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul:</verse>
  <verse number="3">(For my life is yet whole in me, And the spirit of God is in my nostrils);</verse>
  <verse number="4">Surely my lips shall not speak uprighteousness, Neither shall my tongue utter deceit.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Far be it from me that I should justify you: Till I die I will not put away mine integrity from me.</verse>
  <verse number="6">My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Let mine enemy be as the wicked, And let him that riseth up against me be as the unrighteous.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For what is the hope of the godless, though he get him gain, When God taketh away his soul?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Will God hear his cry, When trouble cometh upon him?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Will he delight himself in the Almighty, And call upon God at all times?</verse>
  <verse number="11">I will teach you concerning the hand of God; That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; Why then are ye become altogether vain?</verse>
  <verse number="13">This is the portion of a wicked man with God, And the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty:</verse>
  <verse number="14">If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword; And his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Those that remain of him shall be buried in death, And his widows shall make no lamentation.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Though he heap up silver as the dust, And prepare raiment as the clay;</verse>
  <verse number="17">He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, And the innocent shall divide the silver.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He buildeth his house as the moth, And as a booth which the keeper maketh.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He lieth down rich, but he shall not be gathered to his fathers; He openeth his eyes, and he is not.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Terrors overtake him like waters; A tempest stealeth him away in the night.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth; And it sweepeth him out of his place.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For God shall hurl at him, and not spare: He would fain flee out of his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Men shall clap their hands at him, And shall hiss him out of his place.</verse>
