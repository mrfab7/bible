<chapter book="Ruth" number="1" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And it cometh to pass, in the days of the judging of the judges, that there is a famine in the land, and there goeth a man from Beth-Lehem-Judah to sojourn in the fields of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the name of the man is Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites from Beth-Lehem-Judah; and they come into the fields of Moab, and are there.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Elimelech husband of Naomi dieth, and she is left, she and her two sons;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and they take to them wives, Moabitesses: the name of the one is Orpah, and the name of the second Ruth; and they dwell there about ten years.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And they die also, both of them—Mahlon and Chilion—and the woman is left of her two children and of her husband.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And she riseth, she and her daughters-in-law, and turneth back from the fields of Moab, for she hath heard in the fields of Moab that God hath looked after His people,—to give to them bread.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And she goeth out from the place where she hath been, and her two daughters-in-law with her, and they go in the way to turn back unto the land of Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Naomi saith to her two daughters-in-law, ‘Go, turn back, each to the house of her mother; Jehovah doth with you kindness as ye have done with the dead, and with me;</verse>
  <verse number="9">Jehovah doth grant to you, and find ye rest each in the house of her husband;’ and she kisseth them, and they lift up their voice and weep.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they say to her, ‘Surely with thee we go back to thy people.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Naomi saith, ‘Turn back, my daughters; why do ye go with me? are there yet to me sons in my bowels that they have been to you for husbands?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Turn back, my daughters, go, for I am too aged to be to a husband; though I had said, There is for me hope, also, I have been to-night to a husband, and also I have borne sons:</verse>
  <verse number="13">for them do ye wait till that they grow up? for them do ye shut yourselves up, not to be to a husband? nay, my daughters, for more bitter to me than to you, for the hand of Jehovah hath gone out against me.’</verse>
  <verse number="14">And they lift up their voice, and weep again, and Orpah kisseth her mother-in-law, and Ruth hath cleaved to her.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And she saith, ‘Lo, thy sister-in-law hath turned back unto her people, and unto her god, turn thou back after thy sister-in-law.’</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Ruth saith, ‘Urge me not to leave thee—to turn back from after thee; for whither thou goest I go, and where thou lodgest I lodge; thy people is my people, and thy God my God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Where thou diest I die, and there I am buried; thus doth Jehovah to me, and thus doth He add—for death itself doth part between me and thee.’</verse>
  <verse number="18">And she seeth that she is strengthening herself to go with her, and she ceaseth to speak unto her;</verse>
  <verse number="19">and they go both of them till their coming in to Beth-Lehem; and it cometh to pass at their coming in to Beth-Lehem, that all the city is moved at them, and they say, ‘Is this Naomi?’</verse>
  <verse number="20">And she saith unto them, ‘Call me not Naomi; call me Mara, for the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly to me,</verse>
  <verse number="21">I went out full, and empty hath Jehovah brought me back, why do ye call me Naomi, and Jehovah hath testified against me, and the Almighty hath done evil to me?’</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Naomi turneth back, and Ruth the Moabitess her daughter-in-law with her, who hath turned back from the fields of Moab, and they have come in to Beth-Lehem at the commencement of barley-harvest.</verse>
