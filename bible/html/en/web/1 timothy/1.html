<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Timothy" data-chapter="1" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and Christ Jesus our hope;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">to Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">As I urged you when I was going into Macedonia, stay at Ephesus that you might command certain men not to teach a different doctrine,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">neither to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes, rather than God’s stewardship, which is in faith—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">but the goal of this command is love, out of a pure heart and a good conscience and sincere faith;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">from which things some, having missed the mark, have turned aside to vain talking;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor about what they strongly affirm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But we know that the law is good, if a man uses it lawfully,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">for the sexually immoral, for homosexuals, for slave-traders, for liars, for perjurers, and for any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">according to the Good News of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And I thank him who enabled me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he counted me faithful, appointing me to service;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">although I was before a blasphemer, a persecutor, and insolent. However, I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The saying is faithful and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first, Jesus Christ might display all his patience, for an example of those who were going to believe in him for eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">This instruction I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which led the way to you, that by them you may wage the good warfare;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust away made a shipwreck concerning the faith;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered to Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.</p>
