  <verse number="1">Book of the generation of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat Juda and his brethren;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and Juda begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom, and Esrom begat Aram,</verse>
  <verse number="4">and Aram begat Aminadab, and Aminadab begat Naasson, and Naasson begat Salmon,</verse>
  <verse number="5">and Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse,</verse>
  <verse number="6">and Jesse begat David the king. And David begat Solomon, of her [that had been the wife] of Urias;</verse>
  <verse number="7">and Solomon begat Roboam, and Roboam begat Abia, and Abia begat Asa,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and Asa begat Josaphat, and Josaphat begat Joram, and Joram begat Ozias,</verse>
  <verse number="9">and Ozias begat Joatham, and Joatham begat Achaz, and Achaz begat Ezekias,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and Ezekias begat Manasses, and Manasses begat Amon, and Amon begat Josias,</verse>
  <verse number="11">and Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, at the time of the carrying away of Babylon.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And after the carrying away of Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel, and Salathiel begat Zorobabel,</verse>
  <verse number="13">and Zorobabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and Eliakim begat Azor,</verse>
  <verse number="14">and Azor begat Sadoc, and Sadoc begat Achim, and Achim begat Eliud,</verse>
  <verse number="15">and Eliud begat Eliazar, and Eliazar begat Matthan, and Matthan begat Jacob,</verse>
  <verse number="16">and Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="17">All the generations, therefore, from Abraham to David [were] fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away of Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the carrying away of Babylon unto the Christ, fourteen generations.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Now the birth of Jesus Christ was thus: His mother, Mary, that is, having been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be with child of [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But Joseph, her husband, being [a] righteous [man], and unwilling to expose her publicly, purposed to have put her away secretly;</verse>
  <verse number="20">but while he pondered on these things, behold, an angel of [the] Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, fear not to take to [thee] Mary, thy wife, for that which is begotten in her is of [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Now all this came to pass that that might be fulfilled which was spoken by [the] Lord, through the prophet, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, ‘God with us.’</verse>
  <verse number="24">But Joseph, having awoke up from his sleep, did as the angel of [the] Lord had enjoined him, and took to [him] his wife,</verse>
  <verse number="25">and knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name Jesus.</verse>
