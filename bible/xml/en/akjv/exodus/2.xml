<chapter book="Exodus" number="2" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river’s brink.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; and her maidens walked along by the river’s side; and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews’ children.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call to you a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for you?</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child’s mother.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give you your wages. And the women took the child, and nursed it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brothers, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brothers.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Why smite you your fellow?</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he said, Who made you a prince and a judge over us? intend you to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelled in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that you are come so soon to day?</verse>
  <verse number="19">And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he said to his daughters, And where is he? why is it that you have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God by reason of the bondage.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And God looked on the children of Israel, and God had respect to them.</verse>
