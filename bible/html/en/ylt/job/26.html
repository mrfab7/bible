<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job answereth and saith:—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">What—thou hast helped the powerless, Saved an arm not strong!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">What—thou hast given counsel to the unwise, And wise plans in abundance made known.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">With whom hast thou declared words? And whose breath came forth from thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The Rephaim are formed, Beneath the waters, also their inhabitants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Naked is Sheol over-against Him, And there is no covering to destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Stretching out the north over desolation, Hanging the earth upon nothing,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Binding up the waters in His thick clouds, And the cloud is not rent under them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Taking hold of the face of the throne, Spreading over it His cloud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A limit He hath placed on the waters, Unto the boundary of light with darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Pillars of the heavens do tremble, And they wonder because of His rebuke.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">By His power He hath quieted the sea, And by His understanding smitten the proud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">By His Spirit the heavens He beautified, Formed hath His hand the fleeing serpent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Lo, these are the borders of His way, And how little a matter is heard of Him, And the thunder of His might Who doth understand?</p>
