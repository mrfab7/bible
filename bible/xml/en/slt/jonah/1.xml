  <verse number="1">And the word of Jehovah shall be to Jonah, son of Amittai, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Arise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and call against it; for their evil came up before me.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Jonah will rise up to flee to Tarshish from the face of Jehovah, and he will go down to Joppa; and he will find a ship going to Tarshish, and be will give his hire, and he will go down in it to go with them to Tarshish from the face of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Jehovah cast down a great wind upon the sea, and there will be a great storm upon the sea, and the ship was thought to be broken.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the seamen will fear, and they will cry each to his God, and they cast down the vessels which were in the ship into the sea to lighten from them. And Jonah went down to the sides of the ship, and he will lie down and snore.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the chief sailor will draw near to him and say to him, What to thee, thou snoring? Arise, and call to thy God; perhaps thy God will work for us and we shall not perish.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they will say each to his neighbor, Come, and we will cast the lot, and we shall know for the retributions of this evil to us. And they will cast lots, and the lot will fall upon Jonah.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And they will say to him, Announce now to us, on account of whom is this evil to us? what thy work? and from whence wilt thou come? what thy land? and from what people art thou?</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he will say to them, I an Hebrew; and I feared Jehovah God of the heavens, who made the sea and the dry land.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the men will fear a great fear, and they will say to him, What this thou didst? For the men knew that he fled from the face of Jehovah, for he announced to them.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And they will say to him, What shall we do to thee and the sea shall subside from you? For the sea went and tossed about.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he will say to them, Lift me up and cast me down to the sea, and the sea will subside from you: For I shall know on my account this great storm is upon you.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the men will break through to turn back to the dry land, and they will not be able, for the sea went and tossed about against them.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And they will call to Jehovah, and say, Ah, now, O Jehovah, not now shall we perish for the soul of this man, and thou wilt not give upon us innocent blood: for thou Jehovah didst as thou pleased.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And they will lift up Jonah and cast him down into the sea: and the sea will stand from its foam.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the men feared Jehovah with great fear, and they will sacrifice a sacrifice to Jehovah, and they will vow vows.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Jehovah will prepare a great fish to swallow down Jonah: and Jonah will be in the bowels of the fish three days and three nights.</verse>
