<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="12" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Ye know that when ye were Gentiles ye were led away unto those dumb idols, howsoever ye might be led.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Wherefore I make known unto you, that no man speaking in the Spirit of God saith, Jesus is anathema; and no man can say, Jesus is Lord, but in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And there are diversities of workings, but the same God, who worketh all things in all.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom; and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit:</verse>
  <verse number="9">to another faith, in the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, in the one Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="10">and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits: to another divers kinds of tongues; and to another the interpretation of tongues:</verse>
  <verse number="11">but all these worketh the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each one severally even as he will.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For the body is not one member, but many.</verse>
  <verse number="15">If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; it is not therefore not of the body.</verse>
  <verse number="17">If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</verse>
  <verse number="18">But now hath God set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And if they were all one member, where were the body?</verse>
  <verse number="20">But now they are many members, but one body.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: or again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Nay, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary:</verse>
  <verse number="23">and those parts of the body, which we think to be less honorable, upon these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness;</verse>
  <verse number="24">whereas our comely parts have no need: but God tempered the body together, giving more abundant honor to that part which lacked;</verse>
  <verse number="25">that there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And whether one member suffereth, all the members suffer with it; or one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Now ye are the body of Christ, and severally members thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, divers kinds of tongues.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?</verse>
  <verse number="30">have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?</verse>
  <verse number="31">But desire earnestly the greater gifts. And moreover a most excellent way show I unto you.</verse>
