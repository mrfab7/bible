  <verse number="1">Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?</verse>
  <verse number="3">They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, They cast out their pains.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field; They go forth, and return not again.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Who hath sent out the wild ass free? Or who hath loosed the bonds of the swift ass,</verse>
  <verse number="6">Whose home I have made the wilderness, And the salt land his dwelling-place?</verse>
  <verse number="7">He scorneth the tumult of the city, Neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The range of the mountains is his pasture, And he searcheth after every green thing.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Will the wild-ox be content to serve thee? Or will he abide by thy crib?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow? Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? Or wilt thou leave to him thy labor?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Wilt thou confide in him, that he will bring home thy seed, And gather the grain of thy threshing-floor?</verse>
  <verse number="13">The wings of the ostrich wave proudly; But are they the pinions and plumage of love?</verse>
  <verse number="14">For she leaveth her eggs on the earth, And warmeth them in the dust,</verse>
  <verse number="15">And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, Or that the wild beast may trample them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">She dealeth hardly with her young ones, as if they were not hers: Though her labor be in vain, she is without fear;</verse>
  <verse number="17">Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, Neither hath he imparted to her understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="18">What time she lifteth up herself on high, She scorneth the horse and his rider.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Hast thou given the horse his might? Hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Hast thou made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is terrible.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: He goeth out to meet the armed men.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He mocketh at fear, and is not dismayed; Neither turneth he back from the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The quiver rattleth against him, The flashing spear and the javelin.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage; Neither believeth he that it is the voice of the trumpet.</verse>
  <verse number="25">As oft as the trumpet soundeth he saith, Aha! And he smelleth the battle afar off, The thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Is it by thy wisdom that the hawk soareth, And stretcheth her wings toward the south?</verse>
  <verse number="27">Is it at thy command that the eagle mounteth up, And maketh her nest on high?</verse>
  <verse number="28">On the cliff she dwelleth, and maketh her home, Upon the point of the cliff, and the stronghold.</verse>
  <verse number="29">From thence she spieth out the prey; Her eyes behold it afar off.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Her young ones also suck up blood: And where the slain are, there is she.</verse>
