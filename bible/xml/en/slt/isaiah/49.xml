  <verse number="1">Hear to me, ye islands, and attend ye people from far off; Jehovah called me from the belly; from my mother’s bowels he made mention of my name.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he set my mouth as a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand he hid me, and he will set me for a polished arrow; in his quiver he hid me.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he will say to me, Thou my servant, Israel, whom I will be honored in thee.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And I said, I labored in vain, for emptiness; and I finish my strength vainly; surely my judgment is with Jehovah and my work with my God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And now, said Jehovah, forming me from the belly for servant to him to turn back Jacob to him, And Israel shall not be gathered, and I shall be honored in the eyes of Jehovah, and God was my strength.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he will say, It was light thou being to me a servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to turn back the preserved of Israel: and I gave thee for a light of the nations to be my salvation even to the extremity of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thus said Jehovah redeeming Israel, his Holy One, to the despised of soul, to him being abhorred of the nations, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and princes arose, and they shall worship him for sake of Jehovah who was faithful, the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thus said Jehovah, In a time of acceptance I answered thee, and in the day of salvation I helped thee: and I will guard thee, and I will give thee for a covenant of the people to cause the earth to stand, to cause to inherit the inheritance of desolations,</verse>
  <verse number="9">To say to the bound, Go forth; to those in darkness, Uncover yourselves. They shall feed upon the ways, and in all naked hills their pastures.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They shall not hunger and they shall not thirst, and the heat shall not strike them, and the sun: for he pitying them shall lead them, and to fountains of water he shall conduct them.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And I set all the mountains for a way, and the highways shall be raised up.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Behold, these shall come from far off; and behold, these from the north, and from the sea; and these from the land of Sinim.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Shout, ye heavens, and rejoice thou earth; and the mountains shall break forth with shouting: for Jehovah comforted his people and he will pity his afflicted.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Zion will say, Jehovah forsook me, and the Lord forgot me.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Shall a woman forget her child, from pitying the son of her womb? also these shall forget, and I shall not forget thee.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Behold, upon the palms I engraved thee; thy walls before me continually.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Thy sons hastened; they destroying thee and laying thee waste shall come forth from thee.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Lift up round about thine eyes and see: they all gathered themselves together, they came to thee. I live, says Jehovah, thou shalt put them all on as an ornament, and thou shalt bind them as a bride.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For thy wastes and thy desolations, and the land of thy destruction, for now it shall press for the inhabitants, and they swallowing thee up were far away.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Yet shall the sons of thy bereavement say in thine ears, The place is strait to me: draw near to me and I shall dwell.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And thou saidst in thy heart, Who begat these to me, and I being bereaved and barren, an exile, and departing? and who caused these to grow? Behold, I was left alone; they, where were they?</verse>
  <verse number="22">Thus said the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will lift up my hand to the nations, and to the peoples I will raise up my signal: and they brought thy sons in the bosom, and thy daughters shall be lifted up upon the shoulder.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And kings were thy supporters, and princesses thy nurses: their faces to the earth they shall worship to thee, and the dust of thy feet shall they lick up; and thou knewest that I Jehovah, that they shall not be ashamed waiting for me.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Shall the prey be taken from the strong? and if the captivity of the just shalt be delivered?</verse>
  <verse number="25">For thus said Jehovah, Also the captivity of the strong shall be taken, and the prey of the terrible shall escape: and I will contend with him contending with thee, and thy sons I will save.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And I will cause those oppressing thee to eat their own flesh, and they shall drink their blood to the full as new wine: and all flesh shall know that I am Jehovah saving thee, and redeeming thee, the Mighty One of Jacob.</verse>
