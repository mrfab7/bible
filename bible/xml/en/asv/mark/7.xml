<chapter book="Mark" number="7" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And there are gathered together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, who had come from Jerusalem,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and had seen that some of his disciples ate their bread with defiled, that is, unwashen, hands.</verse>
  <verse number="3">(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands diligently, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and when they come from the marketplace, except they bathe themselves, they eat not; and many other things there are, which they have received to hold, washings of cups, and pots, and brasen vessels.)</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with defiled hands?</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he said unto them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoreth me with their lips, But their heart is far from me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But in vain do they worship me, Teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Ye leave the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he said unto them, Full well do ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your tradition.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For Moses said, Honor thy father and thy mother; and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death:</verse>
  <verse number="11">but ye say, If a man shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is Corban, that is to say, Given to God;</verse>
  <verse number="12">ye no longer suffer him to do aught for his father or his mother;</verse>
  <verse number="13">making void the word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he called to him the multitude again, and said unto them, Hear me all of you, and understand:</verse>
  <verse number="15">there is nothing from without the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.</verse>
  <verse number="16"></verse>
  <verse number="17">And when he was entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked of him the parable.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Perceive ye not, that whatsoever from without goeth into the man, it cannot defile him;</verse>
  <verse number="19">because it goeth not into his heart, but into his belly, and goeth out into the draught? This he said, making all meats clean.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he said, That which proceedeth out of the man, that defileth the man.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For from within, out of the heart of men, evil thoughts proceed, fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,</verse>
  <verse number="22">covetings, wickednesses, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, railing, pride, foolishness:</verse>
  <verse number="23">all these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And from thence he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered into a house, and would have no man know it; and he could not be hid.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But straightway a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. And she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But she answered and saith unto him, Yea, Lord; even the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the demon is gone out of thy daughter.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And she went away unto her house, and found the child laid upon the bed, and the demon gone out.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And again he went out from the borders of Tyre, and came through Sidon unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to lay his hand upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And he took him aside from the multitude privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue;</verse>
  <verse number="34">and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And they were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well; he maketh even the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</verse>
