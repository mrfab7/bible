<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wilt thou draw out the leviathan with the hook, and press down his tongue with a cord?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Wilt thou put a rush-rope into his nose, and pierce his jaw with a spike?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Will he make many supplications unto thee? or will he speak softly unto thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him as a bondman for ever?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Wilt thou play with him as with a bird, and wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Shall partners make traffic of him, will they divide him among merchants?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wilt thou fill his skin with darts, and his head with fish-spears?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Lay thy hand upon him; remember the battle,â€”do no more!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Lo, hope as to him is belied: is not one cast down even at the sight of him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">None is so bold as to stir him up; and who is he that will stand before me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Who hath first given to me, that I should repay [him]? [Whatsoever is] under the whole heaven is mine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I will not be silent as to his parts, the story of his power, and the beauty of his structure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who can uncover the surface of his garment? who can come within his double jaws?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The rows of his shields are a pride, shut up together [as with] a close seal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">One is so near to another that no air can come between them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">They are joined each to its fellow; they stick together, and cannot be sundered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">His sneezings flash light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Out of his mouth go forth flames; sparks of fire leap out:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a boiling pot and cauldron.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">In his neck lodgeth strength, and terror danceth before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are fused upon him, they cannot be moved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">His heart is firm as a stone, yea, firm as the nether [millstone].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: they are beside themselves with consternation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">If any reach him with a sword, it cannot hold; neither spear, nor dart, nor harpoon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He esteemeth iron as straw, bronze as rotten wood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The arrow will not make him flee; slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Clubs are counted as stubble; he laugheth at the shaking of a javelin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">His under parts are sharp potsherds: he spreadeth a threshing-sledge upon the mire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">He maketh the deep to boil like a pot; he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He maketh the path to shine after him: one would think the deep to be hoary.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">He beholdeth all high things; he is king over all the proud beasts.</p>
