<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The desert and the dryness shall be glad for them; and the sterile region shall rejoice and blossom as the meadow flower.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Blossoming, it shall blossom and rejoice, also with joy and shouting: the glory of Lebanon was given to it, the majesty of Carmel and Sharon they shall see the glory of Jehovah, the majesty of our God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Strengthen the relaxed hands and make firm the feeble knees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Say to those hasty of heart, Be strong ye shall not fear; behold, your God will come with vengeance, the recompense of God; he will come and save you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be opened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then shall the lame one leap as the stag, and the tongue of the dumb shall give forth the voice: for waters brake forth in the desert, and torrents in the sterile region.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the dry was for a pool, and the thirsty land for fountains of water: in the dwelling of jackals its lying down, an enclosure for the reed and the bulrush</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And a highway was there, and a way, and it shall be called to it, A way of holiness; the unclean one shall not pass through it; and it is for them; he going the way, and the foolish shall not err.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The lion shall not be there, and the rapacious beast shall not go up upon it, it shall not be found there; and the redeemed went.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the ransomed of Jehovah shall turn back and come to Zion with a shout of joy and eternal joy upon their heads: and they shall attain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</p>
