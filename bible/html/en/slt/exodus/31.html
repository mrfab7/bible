<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, Saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">See, I called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I will fill him with the spirit of God, in wisdom and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To meditate work of skill, to work in gold and in silver and in brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And in graving stone for filling up, and in graving wood, to work in all work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And I, behold, I gave him Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all the wise of heart I gave wisdom; and they shall make all which I commanded thee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The tent of appointment, and the ark of testimony, and the cover which is upon it, and all the vessels of the tent,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the table and its vessels, and the pure chandelier and all its vessels, and the altar of incense,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the altar of burnt-offering and all its vessels, and the wash-basin and its base,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the garments of service, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons to be priests,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The oil of anointing, and the incense of aromatics for the holy place: according to all which I commanded thee they shall do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Jehovah will say to Moses, saying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Speak thou to the sons of Israel, saying, Verily my Sabbaths shall ye watch: for it is a sign between me and between you for your generations, to know that I am Jehovah consecrating you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And watch ye the Sabbath, for it is holy to you. He profaning it, dying, shall die; for all doing work in it, and that soul shall be cut off from the midst of his people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Six days shall work be done, and the seventh day the Sabbath, a holy rest to Jehovah: all doing work in the day of the Sabbath, dying, shall die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the sons of Israel shall watch the Sabbath to do the Sabbath for their generation, a covenant forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Between me and between the sons of Israel it is a sign forever: for six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth, and in the seventh day he rested and he will be refreshed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he will give to Moses when he ceased to speak to him in mount Sinai, two tables of the testimony, tables of stone written by the finger of God.</p>
