1	Thus the Lord Jehovah caused me to see: and behold, a basket of fruit.
2	And he will say, Amos, what seest thou? And saying, A basket of fruit. And Jehovah will say to me: The end came upon my people Israel; I will no more add to pass by to him.
3	The songs of the temple wailed in that day, says the Lord Jehovah; many a corpse in every place being cast forth: silence.
4	Hear this, ye, panting after the needy, to cause the humble of the, land to cease.
5	Saying, When will the month pass through, and we will sell grain? and the Sabbath, and we will open wheat to diminish the ephah, and to enlarge the shekel, and to make crooked the balance of deceit?
6	To buy the poor with silver, and the needy for shoes; and we will sell the refuse of the grain.
7	Jehovah sware by the pride of Jacob, If I will forget forever all their works.
8	For this shall not the land be moved, and all dwelling in it, mourn? And it came up all of it as a river; and it was driven out and watered as the river of Egypt.
9	And it was in that day, says the Lord Jehovah, I caused the sun to set at noon, and I darkened the light to the earth in that day:
10	And turned your festivals into mourning, and all your songs to lamentation; and I brought up sackcloth upon all loins, and upon every head, baldness; and I set it as the mourning of an only one, and its last part as a day of bitterness.
11	Behold, the days coming, says the Lord Jehovah, and I sent famine into the land; not a famine for bread, and not a thirst for water, but for hearing the words of Jehovah.
12	And they wandered from sea even to sea, and from the north and even to the sunrising, they shall run up and down to seek the word of Jehovah and they shall not find.
13	In that day the fair virgins shall faint, and the young men, for thirst.
14	They swearing by the trespass of Shomeron, and they said, Thy God lives, O Dan, and the way of the well of the oath lives, and they fell, and they shall rise no more.
