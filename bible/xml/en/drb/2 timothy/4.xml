  <verse number="1">I charge thee, before God and Jesus Christ, who shall judge the living and the dead, by his coming, and his kingdom:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Preach the word: be instant in season, out of season: reprove, entreat, rebuke in all patience and doctrine.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For there shall be a time, when they will not endure sound doctrine; but, according to their own desires, they will heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears:</verse>
  <verse number="4">And will indeed turn away their hearing from the truth, but will be turned unto fables.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But be thou vigilant, labour in all things, do the work of an evangelist, fulfil thy ministry. Be sober.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For I am even now ready to be sacrificed: and the time of my dissolution is at hand.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith.</verse>
  <verse number="8">As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice, which the Lord the just judge will render to me in that day: and not only to me, but to them also that love his coming. Make haste to come to me quickly.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For Demas hath left me, loving this world, and is gone to Thessalonica:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Crescens into Galatia, Titus into Dalmatia.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The cloak that I left at Troas, with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, especially the parchments.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Alexander the coppersmith hath done me much evil: the Lord will reward him according to his works:</verse>
  <verse number="15">Whom do thou also avoid, for he hath greatly withstood our words.</verse>
  <verse number="16">At my first answer no man stood with me, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their charge.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that by me the preaching may be accomplished, and that all the Gentiles may hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The Lord hath delivered me from every evil work: and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Erastus remained at Corinth. And Trophimus I left sick at Miletus.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Make haste to come before winter Eubulus and Pudens, and Linus and Claudia, and all the brethren, salute thee.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</verse>
