  <verse number="1">Moreover Elihu answered and said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thinkest thou this to be thy right, Or sayest thou: ‘I am righteousness before God’,</verse>
  <verse number="3">That thou inquirest: ‘What advantage will it be unto Thee?’ And: ‘What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?’</verse>
  <verse number="4">I will give thee answer, And thy companions with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Look unto the heavens, and see; And behold the skies, which are higher than thou.</verse>
  <verse number="6">If thou hast sinned, what doest thou against Him? And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto Him?</verse>
  <verse number="7">If thou be righteous, what givest thou Him? Or what receiveth He of thy hand?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thy wickedness concerneth a man as thou art; And thy righteousness a son of man.</verse>
  <verse number="9">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But none saith: ‘Where is God my Maker, Who giveth songs in the night;</verse>
  <verse number="11">Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, And maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?’</verse>
  <verse number="12">There they cry, but none giveth answer, Because of the pride of evil men.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Surely God will not hear vanity, Neither will the Almighty regard it.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Yea, when thou sayest thou canst not see Him—The cause is before Him; therefore wait thou for Him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And now, is it for nought that He punished in His anger? And hath He not full knowledge of arrogance?</verse>
  <verse number="16">But Job doth open his mouth in vanity; He multiplieth words without knowledge.</verse>
