<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Pass through Calneh, and see; and go ye from thence to Hamath the great: and go down to the wine-press of the rovers: are they good above these kingdoms? or their bound great above your bound?</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Prating upon the mouth of the lyre, as David they invented to them instruments of music;</p>
