<chapter book="2 Samuel" number="22" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And David spoke to the LORD the words of this song in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;</verse>
  <verse number="3">The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my savior; you save me from violence.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from my enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="5">When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;</verse>
  <verse number="6">The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;</verse>
  <verse number="7">In my distress I called on the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his ears.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he rode on a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen on the wings of the wind.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;</verse>
  <verse number="18">He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</verse>
  <verse number="20">He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands has he recompensed me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes, I did not depart from them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from my iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Therefore the LORD has recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.</verse>
  <verse number="26">With the merciful you will show yourself merciful, and with the upright man you will show yourself upright.</verse>
  <verse number="27">With the pure you will show yourself pure; and with the fraudulent you will show yourself unsavory.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the afflicted people you will save: but your eyes are on the haughty, that you may bring them down.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For you are my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For by you I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.</verse>
  <verse number="31">As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our God?</verse>
  <verse number="33">God is my strength and power: and he makes my way perfect.</verse>
  <verse number="34">He makes my feet like hinds’ feet: and sets me on my high places.</verse>
  <verse number="35">He teaches my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by my arms.</verse>
  <verse number="36">You have also given me the shield of your salvation: and your gentleness has made me great.</verse>
  <verse number="37">You have enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.</verse>
  <verse number="38">I have pursued my enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yes, they are fallen under my feet.</verse>
  <verse number="40">For you have girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me have you subdued under me.</verse>
  <verse number="41">You have also given me the necks of my enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.</verse>
  <verse number="42">They looked, but there was none to save; even to the LORD, but he answered them not.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.</verse>
  <verse number="44">You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people, you have kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not shall serve me.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Strangers shall submit themselves to me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient to me.</verse>
  <verse number="46">Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.</verse>
  <verse number="47">The LORD lives; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="48">It is God that avenges me, and that brings down the people under me.</verse>
  <verse number="49">And that brings me forth from my enemies: you also have lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: you have delivered me from the violent man.</verse>
  <verse number="50">Therefore I will give thanks to you, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises to your name.</verse>
  <verse number="51">He is the tower of salvation for his king: and shows mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for ever more.</verse>
