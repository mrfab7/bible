<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Whoever loves instruction loves knowledge: but he that hates reproof is brutish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A good man obtains favor of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that makes ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He that is despised, and has a servant, is better than he that honors himself, and lacks bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A righteous man regards the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He that tills his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that follows vain persons is void of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The wicked desires the net of evil men: but the root of the righteous yields fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the just shall come out of trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth: and the recompense of a man’s hands shall be rendered to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that listens to counsel is wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A fool’s wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covers shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He that speaks truth shows forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">There is that speaks like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise is health.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace is joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Lying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly are his delight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">A prudent man conceals knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaims foolishness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Heaviness in the heart of man makes it stoop: but a good word makes it glad.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The righteous is more excellent than his neighbor: but the way of the wicked seduces them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The slothful man roasts not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man is precious.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">In the way of righteousness is life: and in the pathway thereof there is no death.</p>
