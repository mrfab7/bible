<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold [where] they fine [it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass [is] molten [out of] the stone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; [even the waters] forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">[As for] the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The stones of it [are] the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">[There is] a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture’s eye hath not seen:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The lion’s whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and [the thing that is] hid bringeth he forth to light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But where shall wisdom be found? and where [is] the place of understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The depth saith, It [is] not in me: and the sea saith, [It is] not with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed [for] the price thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it [shall not be for] jewels of fine gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom [is] above rubies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Whence then cometh wisdom? and where [is] the place of understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For he looketh to the ends of the earth, [and] seeth under the whole heaven;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that [is] wisdom; and to depart from evil [is] understanding.</p>
