1	Just as the morning passes, so has the king of Israel passed by. For Israel was a child and I loved him; and out of Egypt I called my son.
2	They called them, and so they departed before their face. They offered victims to the Baals, and they sacrificed to graven images.
3	And I was like a foster father to Ephraim. I carried them in my arms. And they did not know that I healed them.
4	I will draw them with the cords of Adam, with the bands of love. And I will be to them like one who raises the yoke over their jaws. And I will reach down to him so that he may eat.
5	He will not return to the land of Egypt, but Assur himself will be the king over him, because they were not willing to be converted.
6	The sword has begun in his cities, and it will consume his elect and devour their heads.
7	And my people will long for my return. But a yoke will be imposed on them together, which will not be taken away.
8	How will I provide for you, Ephraim; how will I protect you, Israel? How will I provide for you as for Adam; will I set you like Zeboiim? My heart has changed within me; together with my regret, it has been stirred up.
9	I will not act on the fury of my wrath. I will not turn back to utterly destroy Ephraim. For I am God, and not man, the Divine in your midst, and I will not advance upon the city.
10	They will walk after the Lord; he will roar like a lion. For he himself will roar, and the sons of the sea will dread.
11	And they will fly like a bird out of Egypt, and like a dove from the land of the Assyrians. And I will arrange them in their own houses, says the Lord.
12	Ephraim has besieged me with denials, and the house of Israel with deceit. But Judah went down as a witness before God and the holy ones of faith.
