<chapter book="Mark" number="13" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Jesus answering said to him, See you these great buildings? there shall not be left one stone on another, that shall not be thrown down.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And as he sat on the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Jesus answering them began to say, Take heed lest any man deceive you:</verse>
  <verse number="6">For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And when you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars, be you not troubled: for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be earthquakes in divers places, and there shall be famines and troubles: these are the beginnings of sorrows.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But take heed to yourselves: for they shall deliver you up to councils; and in the synagogues you shall be beaten: and you shall be brought before rulers and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the gospel must first be published among all nations.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But when they shall lead you, and deliver you up, take no thought beforehand what you shall speak, neither do you premeditate: but whatever shall be given you in that hour, that speak you: for it is not you that speak, but the Holy Ghost.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now the brother shall betray the brother to death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents, and shall cause them to be put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And you shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But when you shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not, (let him that reads understand,) then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains:</verse>
  <verse number="15">And let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein, to take any thing out of his house:</verse>
  <verse number="16">And let him that is in the field not turn back again for to take up his garment.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!</verse>
  <verse number="18">And pray you that your flight be not in the winter.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For in those days shall be affliction, such as was not from the beginning of the creation which God created to this time, neither shall be.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect’s sake, whom he has chosen, he has shortened the days.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And then if any man shall say to you, See, here is Christ; or, see, he is there; believe him not:</verse>
  <verse number="22">For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall show signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But take you heed: behold, I have foretold you all things.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light,</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the stars of heaven shall fall, and the powers that are in heaven shall be shaken.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And then shall he send his angels, and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth to the uttermost part of heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When her branch is yet tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near:</verse>
  <verse number="29">So you in like manner, when you shall see these things come to pass, know that it is near, even at the doors.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Truly I say to you, that this generation shall not pass, till all these things be done.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass away.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But of that day and that hour knows no man, no, not the angels which are in heaven, neither the Son, but the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Take you heed, watch and pray: for you know not when the time is.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey, who left his house, and gave authority to his servants, and to every man his work, and commanded the porter to watch.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Watch you therefore: for you know not when the master of the house comes, at even, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning:</verse>
  <verse number="36">Lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And what I say to you I say to all, Watch.</verse>
