<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Open thy doors, O Lebanon, That the fire may devour thy cedars.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Wail, O cypress-tree, for the cedar is fallen; Because the glorious ones are spoiled; Wail, O ye oaks of Bashan, For the strong forest is come down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Hark! the wailing of the shepherds, For their glory is spoiled; Hark! the roaring of young lions, For the thickets of the Jordan are spoiled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thus said the LORD my God: ‘Feed the flock of slaughter;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">whose buyers slay them, and hold themselves not guilty; and they that sell them say: Blessed be the LORD, for I am rich; and their own shepherds pity them not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD; but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his neighbour’s hand, and into the hand of his king; and they shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver them.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">So I fed the flock of slaughter, verily the poor of the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Graciousness, and the other I called Binders; and I fed the flock.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And I cut off the three shepherds in one month; ‘for My soul became impatient of them, and their soul also loathed Me.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then said I: ‘I will not feed you; that which dieth, let it die; and that which is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let them that are left eat every one the flesh of another.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I took my staff Graciousness, and cut it asunder, ‘that I might break My covenant which I had made with all the peoples.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And it was broken in that day; and the poor of the flock that gave heed unto me knew of a truth that it was the word of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And I said unto them: ‘If ye think good, give me my hire; and if not, forbear.’ So they weighed for my hire thirty pieces of silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the LORD said unto me: ‘Cast it into the treasury, the goodly price that I was prized at of them.’ And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them into the treasury, in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Binders, that the brotherhood between Judah and Israel might be broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the LORD said unto me: ‘Take unto thee yet the instruments of a foolish shepherd.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who will not think of those that are cut off, neither will seek those that are young, nor heal that which is broken; neither will he feed that which standeth still, but he will eat the flesh of the fat, and will break their hoofs in pieces.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Woe to the worthless shepherd That leaveth the flock! The sword shall be upon his arm, And upon his right eye; His arm shall be clean dried up, And his right eye shall be utterly darkened.</p>
