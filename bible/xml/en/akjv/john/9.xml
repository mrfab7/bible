  <verse number="1">And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night comes, when no man can work.</verse>
  <verse number="5">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="6">When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,</verse>
  <verse number="7">And said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The neighbors therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore said they to him, How were your eyes opened?</verse>
  <verse number="11">He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Then said they to him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</verse>
  <verse number="13">They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said to them, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and do see.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keeps not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They say to the blind man again, What say you of him, that he has opened your eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who you say was born blind? how then does he now see?</verse>
  <verse number="20">His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</verse>
  <verse number="21">But by what means he now sees, we know not; or who has opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</verse>
  <verse number="22">These words spoke his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then again called they the man that was blind, and said to him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</verse>
  <verse number="25">He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Then said they to him again, What did he to you? how opened he your eyes?</verse>
  <verse number="27">He answered them, I have told you already, and you did not hear: why would you hear it again? will you also be his disciples?</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then they reviled him, and said, You are his disciple; but we are Moses’ disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="29">We know that God spoke to Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from where he is.</verse>
  <verse number="30">The man answered and said to them, Why herein is a marvelous thing, that you know not from where he is, and yet he has opened my eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Now we know that God hears not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and does his will, him he hears.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</verse>
  <verse number="33">If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="34">They answered and said to him, You were altogether born in sins, and do you teach us? And they cast him out.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said to him, Do you believe on the Son of God?</verse>
  <verse number="36">He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</verse>
  <verse number="37">And Jesus said to him, You have both seen him, and it is he that talks with you.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said to him, Are we blind also?</verse>
  <verse number="41">Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you should have no sin: but now you say, We see; therefore your sin remains.</verse>
