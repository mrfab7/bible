  <verse number="1">And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Command the children of Israel, and then shalt say to them: When you are entered into the land of Chanaan, and it shall be fallen into your possession by lot, it shall be bounded by these limits:</verse>
  <verse number="3">The south side shall begin from the wilderness of Sin, which is by Edom: and shall have the most salt sea for its furthest limits eastward:</verse>
  <verse number="4">Which limits shall go round on the south side by the ascent of the Scorpion and so into Senna, and reach toward the south as far as Cadesbarne, from whence the frontiers shall go out to the town called Adar, and shall reach as far as Asemona.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the limits shall fetch a compass from Asemona to the torrent of Egypt, and shall end in the shore of the great sea.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the west side shall begin from the great sea, and the same shall be the end thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But toward the north side the borders shall begin from the great sea, reaching to the most high mountain,</verse>
  <verse number="8">From which they shall come to Emath, as far as the borders of Sedada:</verse>
  <verse number="9">nod the limits shall go as far as Zephrona, and the village of Enan. These shall be the borders on the north side.</verse>
  <verse number="10">From thence they shall mark out the bounds towards the east side from the village of Enan unto Sephama.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And from Sephama the bounds shall go down to Rebla over against the fountain of Daphnis: from thence they shall come eastward to the sea of Cenereth,</verse>
  <verse number="12">And shall reach as far as the Jordan, and at the last shall be closed in by the most salt sea. This shall be your land with its borders round about.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying: This shall be the land which you shall possess by lot, and which the Lord hath commanded to be given to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For the tribe of the children of Ruben by their families, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the number of their kindreds, and half of the tribe of Manasses,</verse>
  <verse number="15">That is, two tribes and a half, have received their portion beyond the Jordan over against Jericho at the east side.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the Lord said to Moses:</verse>
  <verse number="17">These are the names of the men, that shall divide the land unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Josue the son of Nun,</verse>
  <verse number="18">And one prince of every tribe,</verse>
  <verse number="19">Whose names are these : Of the tribe of Juda, Caleb the son of Jephone.</verse>
