<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="9" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">For concerning the ministry that is done towards the saints, it is superfluous for me to write unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For I know your forward mind: for which I boast of you to the Macedonians. That Achaia also is ready from the year past, and your emulation hath provoked very many.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Now I have sent the brethren, that the thing which we boast of concerning you, be not made void in this behalf, that (as I have said) you may be ready:</verse>
  <verse number="4">Lest, when the Macedonians shall come with me, and find you unprepared, we (not to say ye) should be ashamed in this matter.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Therefore I thought it necessary to desire the brethren that they would go to you before, and prepare this blessing before promised, to be ready, so as a blessing, not as covetousness.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now this I say: He who soweth sparingly, shall also reap sparingly: and he who soweth in blessings, shall also reap blessings.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Every one as he hath determined in his heart, not with sadness, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And God is able to make all grace abound in you; that ye always, having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work,</verse>
  <verse number="9">As it is written: He hath dispersed abroad, he hath given to the poor: his justice remaineth for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And he that ministereth seed to the sower, will both give you bread to eat, and will multiply your seed, and increase the growth of the fruits of your justice:</verse>
  <verse number="11">That being enriched in all things, you may abound unto all simplicity, which worketh through us thanksgiving to God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Because the administration of this office doth not only supply the want of the saints, but aboundeth also by many thanksgivings in the Lord,</verse>
  <verse number="13">By the proof of this ministry, glorifying God for the obedience of your confession unto the gospel of Christ, and for the simplicity of your communicating unto them, and unto all.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And in their praying for you, being desirous of you, because of the excellent grace of God in you.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.</verse>
