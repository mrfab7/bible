  <verse number="1">And Elijah the Tishbite from the Tishbites of Gilead, will say to Ahab, Jehovah the God of Israel lives whom I stood before him if there shall be dew and rain but according to the mouth of my word.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the word of Jehovah will be to him, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="3">Go from hence and turn to thyself east, and hide by the torrent Cherith which is before Jordan.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And being thou shalt drink from the torrent; and I commanded the ravens to nourish thee there.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he will go and do according to the word of Jehovah: and he will go and dwell by the torrent Cherith which is upon the face of Jordan.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the ravens bringing to him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he will drink from the torrent.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And it will be from the end of days, and the torrent will dry up, for there was no rain upon the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the word of Jehovah will be to him, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="9">Arise, go to Zarephath which is to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I commanded a widow woman to nourish thee there.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And he will rise and go to Zarephath, and will come to the entrance of the city, and behold there a widow woman gathering wood: and he will call to her, and say, Take now to me a little water in a vessel, and I will drink.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And she will go to take, and he will call to her and say, Take now to me a bit of bread in thy hand.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And she will say, Jehovah thy God lives, if there is to me a cake, but a handful of flour in a bucket, and a little oil in a cruse: and behold me gathering two woods, and I went to do it for me and for my son, and we shall eat and die.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Elijah will say to her, Thou shalt not fear; go and do according to thy word: but make to me from thence a little cake at first, and bring forth to me, and for thee and for thy son thou shalt make at last.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For thus said Jehovah the God of Israel, The bucket of flour shall not be spent, and the cruse of oil shall not fail until the day Jehovah shall give rain upon the face of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And she will go and do according to the word of Elijah: and she will eat, she and he, and her house, days.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The bucket of flour was not spent, and the cruse of oil failed no; according to the word of Jehovah which he spake by the hand of Elijah.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And it will be after these words, the son of the woman, the lady of the house, was sick, and his sickness was very strong till that breath was not left in him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And she will say to Elijah, What to me and to thee, thou man of God? camest thou to me to bring to remembrance mine iniquity, and to kill my son?</verse>
  <verse number="19">And he will say to her, Give to me thy son. And he will take him from her bosom and bring him up into an upper chamber where he sat there, and he will lay him upon his bed.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he will call to Jehovah, and say, Jehovah my God, didst thou also do evil upon the widow which I dwelt with her to kill her son?</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he will measure upon the child three times, and he will call to Jehovah, and say, Jehovah my God wilt thou turn back now the soul of this child within his inner part?</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Jehovah will hear to the voice of Elijah, and he will turn back the soul of the child within his inner part, and he will live.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Elijah will take the child and bring him down from the upper chamber of the house, and give him to his mother: and Elijah will say, See, thy son lives.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the woman will say to Elijah, Now this I know that thou a man of God, and the word of Jehovah in thy mouth, truth.</verse>
