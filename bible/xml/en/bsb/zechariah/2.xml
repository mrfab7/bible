  <verse number="1">Then I lifted up my eyes and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Where are you going?” I asked. “To measure Jerusalem,” he replied, “and to determine its width and length.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then the angel who was speaking with me went forth, and another angel came forward to meet him</verse>
  <verse number="4">and said to him, “Run and tell that young man: ‘Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the multitude of men and livestock within it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For I will be a wall of fire around it, declares the LORD, and I will be the glory within it.’”</verse>
  <verse number="6">“Get up! Get up! Flee from the land of the north,” declares the LORD, “for I have scattered you like the four winds of heaven,” declares the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="7">“Get up, O Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the Daughter of Babylon!”</verse>
  <verse number="8">For this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “After His Glory has sent Me against the nations that have plundered you—for whoever touches you touches the apple of His eye—</verse>
  <verse number="9">I will surely wave My hand over them, so that they will become plunder for their own servants. Then you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me.”</verse>
  <verse number="10">“Shout for joy and be glad, O Daughter of Zion, for I am coming to dwell among you,” declares the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="11">“On that day many nations will join themselves to the LORD, and they will become My people. I will dwell among you, and you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me to you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the LORD will take possession of Judah as His portion in the Holy Land, and He will once again choose Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Be silent before the LORD, all people, for He has roused Himself from His holy dwelling.”</verse>
