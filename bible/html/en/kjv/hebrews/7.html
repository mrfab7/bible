<div class="chapter" data-book="Hebrews" data-chapter="7" data-translation="King James Bible" data-translation-id="kjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of peace;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Now consider how great this man [was], unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the better.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And here men that die receive tithes; but there he [receiveth them], of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed tithes in Abraham.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need [was there] that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For [it is] evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For he testifieth, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope [did]; by the which we draw nigh unto God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And inasmuch as not without an oath [he was made priest]:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And they truly were many priests, because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But this [man], because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable priesthood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For such an high priest became us, [who is] holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the peopleâ€™s: for this he did once, when he offered up himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, [maketh] the Son, who is consecrated for evermore.</p>
