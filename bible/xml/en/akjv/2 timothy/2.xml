<chapter book="2 Timothy" number="2" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the things that you have heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit you to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</verse>
  <verse number="3">You therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="4">No man that wars entangles himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The farmer that labors must be first partaker of the fruits.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Consider what I say; and the Lord give you understanding in all things.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even to bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</verse>
  <verse number="11">It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:</verse>
  <verse number="12">If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:</verse>
  <verse number="13">If we believe not, yet he stays faithful: he cannot deny himself.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Study to show yourself approved to God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase to more ungodliness.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And their word will eat as does a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</verse>
  <verse number="18">Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his. And, Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor.</verse>
  <verse number="21">If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honor, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, and prepared to every good work.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do engender strifes.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle to all men, apt to teach, patient,</verse>
  <verse number="25">In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</verse>
  <verse number="26">And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</verse>
