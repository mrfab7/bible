<chapter book="Isaiah" number="53" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Who has believed our message? To whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed?</verse>
  <verse number="2">For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of dry ground. He has no good looks or majesty. When we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">He was despised, and rejected by men; a man of suffering, and acquainted with disease. He was despised as one from whom men hide their face; and we didn’t respect him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Surely he has borne our sickness, and carried our suffering; yet we considered him plagued, struck by God, and afflicted.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But he was pierced for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities. The punishment that brought our peace was on him; and by his wounds we are healed.</verse>
  <verse number="6">All we like sheep have gone astray. Everyone has turned to his own way; and Yahweh has laid on him the iniquity of us all.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He was oppressed, yet when he was afflicted he didn’t open his mouth. As a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before its shearers is mute, so he didn’t open his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He was taken away by oppression and judgment; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living and stricken for the disobedience of my people?</verse>
  <verse number="9">They made his grave with the wicked, and with a rich man in his death; although he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Yet it pleased Yahweh to bruise him. He has caused him to suffer. When you make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed. He shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of Yahweh shall prosper in his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="11">After the suffering of his soul, he will see the light and be satisfied. My righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself; and he will bear their iniquities.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul to death, and was numbered with the transgressors; yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</verse>
