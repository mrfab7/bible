  <verse number="1">I will stand on my watch, and set me on the tower, and will watch to see what he will say to me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make it plain on tables, that he may run that reads it.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Yes also, because he transgresses by wine, he is a proud man, neither keeps at home, who enlarges his desire as hell, and is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathers to him all nations, and heaps to him all people:</verse>
  <verse number="6">Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increases that which is not his! how long? and to him that lades himself with thick clay!</verse>
  <verse number="7">Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite you, and awake that shall vex you, and you shall be for booties to them?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Because you have spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil you; because of men’s blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Woe to him that covets an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!</verse>
  <verse number="10">You have consulted shame to your house by cutting off many people, and have sinned against your soul.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Woe to him that builds a town with blood, and establishes a city by iniquity!</verse>
  <verse number="13">Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall labor in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?</verse>
  <verse number="14">For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Woe to him that gives his neighbor drink, that put your bottle to him, and make him drunken also, that you may look on their nakedness!</verse>
  <verse number="16">You are filled with shame for glory: drink you also, and let your foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD’s right hand shall be turned to you, and shameful spewing shall be on your glory.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For the violence of Lebanon shall cover you, and the spoil of beasts, which made them afraid, because of men’s blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</verse>
  <verse number="18">What profits the graven image that the maker thereof has graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusts therein, to make dumb idols?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Woe to him that said to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in the middle of it.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.</verse>
