<chapter book="Job" number="6" translation="King James Bible" translationID="kjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But Job answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!</verse>
  <verse number="3">For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For the arrows of the Almighty [are] within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there [any] taste in the white of an egg?</verse>
  <verse number="7">The things [that] my soul refused to touch [are] as my sorrowful meat.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant [me] the thing that I long for!</verse>
  <verse number="9">Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</verse>
  <verse number="11">What [is] my strength, that I should hope? and what [is] mine end, that I should prolong my life?</verse>
  <verse number="12">[Is] my strength the strength of stones? or [is] my flesh of brass?</verse>
  <verse number="13">[Is] not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</verse>
  <verse number="14">To him that is afflicted pity [should be shewed] from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
  <verse number="15">My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, [and] as the stream of brooks they pass away;</verse>
  <verse number="16">Which are blackish by reason of the ice, [and] wherein the snow is hid:</verse>
  <verse number="17">What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For now ye are nothing; ye see [my] casting down, and are afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Or, Deliver me from the enemy’s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</verse>
  <verse number="25">How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?</verse>
  <verse number="26">Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, [which are] as wind?</verse>
  <verse number="27">Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig [a pit] for your friend.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Now therefore be content, look upon me; for [it is] evident unto you if I lie.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness [is] in it.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?</verse>
