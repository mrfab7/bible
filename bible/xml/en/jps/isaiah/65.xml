  <verse number="1">I gave access to them that asked not for Me, I was at hand to them that sought Me not; I said: ‘Behold Me, behold Me’, Unto a nation that was not called by My name.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I have spread out My hands all the day Unto a rebellious people, That walk in a way that is not good, After their own thoughts;</verse>
  <verse number="3">A people that provoke Me To My face continually, That sacrifice in gardens, And burn incense upon bricks;</verse>
  <verse number="4">That sit among the graves, And lodge in the vaults; That eat swine’s flesh, And broth of abominable things is in their vessels;</verse>
  <verse number="5">That say: ‘Stand by thyself, Come not near to me, for I am holier than thou’; These are a smoke in My nose, A fire that burneth all the day.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Behold, it is written before Me; I will not keep silence, except I have requited, Yea, I will requite into their bosom,</verse>
  <verse number="7">Your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, Saith the LORD, that have offered upon the mountains, And blasphemed Me upon the hills; Therefore will I first measure their wage into their bosom.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thus saith the LORD: As, when wine is found in the cluster, One saith: ‘Destroy it not, For a blessing is in it’; So will I do for My servants’ sakes, That I may not destroy all.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, And out of Judah an inheritor of My mountains; And Mine elect shall inherit it, And My servants shall dwell there.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, And the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, For My people that have sought Me;</verse>
  <verse number="11">But ye that forsake the LORD, That forget My holy mountain, That prepare a table for Fortune, And that offer mingled wine in full measure unto Destiny,</verse>
  <verse number="12">I will destine you to the sword, And ye shall all bow down to the slaughter; Because when I called, ye did not answer, When I spoke, ye did not hear; But ye did that which was evil in Mine eyes, And chose that wherein I delighted not.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, My servants shall eat, But ye shall be hungry; Behold, My servants shall drink, But ye shall be thirsty; Behold, My servants shall rejoice, But ye shall be ashamed;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Behold, My servants shall sing For joy of heart, But ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, And shall wail for vexation of spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto Mine elect: ‘So may the Lord GOD slay thee’; But He shall call His servants by another name;</verse>
  <verse number="16">So that he who blesseth himself in the earth Shall bless himself by the God of truth; And he that sweareth in the earth Shall swear by the God of truth; Because the former troubles are forgotten, And because they are hid from Mine eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For, behold, I create new heavens And a new earth; And the former things shall not be remembered, Nor come into mind.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But be ye glad and rejoice for ever In that which I create; For, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, And her people a joy.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, And joy in My people; And the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, Nor the voice of crying.</verse>
  <verse number="20">There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man, That hath not filled his days; For the youngest shall die a hundred years old, And the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; And they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</verse>
  <verse number="22">They shall not build, and another inhabit, They shall not plant, and another eat; For as the days of a tree shall be the days of My people, And Mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</verse>
  <verse number="23">They shall not labour in vain, Nor bring forth for terror; For they are the seed blessed of the LORD, And their offspring with them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer, And while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, And the lion shall eat straw like the ox; And dust shall be the serpent’s food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, Saith the LORD.</verse>
