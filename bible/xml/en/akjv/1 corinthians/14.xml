<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="14" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For he that speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not to men, but to God: for no man understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But he that prophesies speaks to men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He that speaks in an unknown tongue edifies himself; but he that prophesies edifies the church.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I would that you all spoke with tongues but rather that you prophesied: for greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?</verse>
  <verse number="7">And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?</verse>
  <verse number="8">For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?</verse>
  <verse number="9">So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for you shall speak into the air.</verse>
  <verse number="10">There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaks a barbarian, and he that speaks shall be a barbarian to me.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Even so you, for as much as you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Why let him that speaks in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.</verse>
  <verse number="15">What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Else when you shall bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupies the room of the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he understands not what you say?</verse>
  <verse number="17">For you truly give thanks well, but the other is not edified.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than you all:</verse>
  <verse number="19">Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Brothers, be not children in understanding: however, in malice be you children, but in understanding be men.</verse>
  <verse number="21">In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak to this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, said the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Why tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serves not for them that believe not, but for them which believe.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?</verse>
  <verse number="24">But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believes not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:</verse>
  <verse number="25">And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</verse>
  <verse number="26">How is it then, brothers? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done to edifying.</verse>
  <verse number="27">If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.</verse>
  <verse number="30">If any thing be revealed to another that sits by, let the first hold his peace.</verse>
  <verse number="31">For you may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="33">For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also said the law.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.</verse>
  <verse number="36">What? came the word of God out from you? or came it to you only?</verse>
  <verse number="37">If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="38">But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</verse>
  <verse number="39">Why, brothers, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.</verse>
  <verse number="40">Let all things be done decently and in order.</verse>
