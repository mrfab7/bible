<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="18" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">He that separateth himself seeketh his own desire, And rageth against all sound wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A fool hath no delight in understanding, But only that his heart may reveal itself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">When the wicked cometh, there cometh also contempt, And with ignominy cometh reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The words of a man’s mouth are as deep waters; The wellspring of wisdom is as a flowing brook.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">To respect the person of the wicked is not good, Nor to turn aside the righteous in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">A fool’s lips enter into contention, And his mouth calleth for stripes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">A fool’s mouth is his destruction, And his lips are the snare of his soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, And they go down into the innermost parts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He also that is slack in his work Is brother to him that is a destroyer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The name of Jehovah is a strong tower; The righteous runneth into it, and is safe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The rich man’s wealth is his strong city, And as a high wall in his own imagination.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Before destruction the heart of man is haughty; And before honor goeth humility.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He that giveth answer before he heareth, It is folly and shame unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; But a broken spirit who can bear?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A man’s gift maketh room for him, And bringeth him before great men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He that pleadeth his cause first seemeth just; But his neighbor cometh and searcheth him out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The lot causeth contentions to cease, And parteth between the mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city; And such contentions are like the bars of a castle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A man’s belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth; With the increase of his lips shall he be satisfied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Death and life are in the power of the tongue; And they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, And obtaineth favor of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The poor useth entreaties; But the rich answereth roughly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He that maketh many friends doeth it to his own destruction; But there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.</p>
