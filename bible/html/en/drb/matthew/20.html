<p class="verse" data-verse="1">THE kingdom of heaven is like to an householder, who went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And having agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And going about the third hour, he saw others standing in the market place idle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he said to them: Go you also into my vineyard, and I will give you what shall be just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And they went their way. And again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did in like manner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing, and he saith to them: Why stand you here all the day idle?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They say to him: Because no man hath hired us. He saith to them: Go you also into my vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And when evening was come, the lord of the vineyard saith to his steward: Call the labourers and pay them their hire, beginning from the last even to the first.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">When therefore they were come, that came about the eleventh hour, they received every man a penny.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But when the first also came, they thought that they should receive more: and they also received every man a penny.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And receiving it they murmured against the master of the house,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Saying: These last have worked but one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us, that have borne the burden of the day and the heats.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But he answering said to one of them: Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst thou not agree with me for a penny?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Take what is thine, and go thy way: I will also give to this last even as to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Or, is it not lawful for me to do what I will? is thy eye evil, because I am good?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">So shall the last be first, and the first last. For many are called, but few chosen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart, and said to them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked, and scourged, and crucified, and the third day he shall rise again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, adoring and asking something of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Who said to her: What wilt thou? She saith to him: Say that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left, in thy kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Jesus answering, said: You know not what you ask. Can you drink the chalice that I shall drink? They say to him: We can.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He saith to them: My chalice indeed you shall drink; but to sit on my right or left hand, is not mine to give to you, but to them for whom it is prepared by my Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And the ten hearing it, were moved with indignation against the two brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But Jesus called them to him, and said: You know that the princes of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they that are the greater, exercise power upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">It shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be the greater among you, let him be your minister:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And he that will be first among you, shall be your servant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Even as the Son of man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a redemption for many.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And when they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And behold two blind men sitting by the way side, heard that Jesus passed by, and they cried out, saying: O Lord, thou son of David, have mercy on us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And the multitude rebuked them that they should hold their peace. But they cried out the more, saying: O Lord, thou son of David, have mercy on us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And Jesus stood, and called them, and said: What will ye that I do to you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">They say to him: Lord, that our eyes be opened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And Jesus having compassion on them, touched their eyes. And immediately they saw, and followed him.</p>
