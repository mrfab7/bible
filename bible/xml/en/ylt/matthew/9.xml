  <verse number="1">And having gone to the boat, he passed over, and came to his own city,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and lo, they were bringing to him a paralytic, laid upon a couch, and Jesus having seen their faith, said to the paralytic, ‘Be of good courage, child, thy sins have been forgiven thee.’</verse>
  <verse number="3">And lo, certain of the scribes said within themselves, ‘This one doth speak evil.’</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Jesus, having known their thoughts, said, ‘Why think ye evil in your hearts?</verse>
  <verse number="5">for which is easier? to say, The sins have been forgiven to thee; or to say, Rise, and walk?</verse>
  <verse number="6">‘But, that ye may know that the Son of Man hath power upon the earth to forgive sins—(then saith he to the paralytic)—having risen, take up thy couch, and go to thy house.’</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he, having risen, went to his house,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and the multitudes having seen, wondered, and glorified God, who did give such power to men.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Jesus passing by thence, saw a man sitting at the tax-office, named Matthew, and saith to him, ‘Be following me,’ and he, having risen, did follow him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And it came to pass, he reclining (at meat) in the house, that lo, many tax-gatherers and sinners having come, were lying (at meat) with Jesus and his disciples,</verse>
  <verse number="11">and the Pharisees having seen, said to his disciples, ‘Wherefore with the tax-gatherers and sinners doth your teacher eat?’</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Jesus having heard, said to them, ‘They who are whole have no need of a physician, but they who are ill;</verse>
  <verse number="13">but having gone, learn ye what is, Kindness I will, and not sacrifice, for I did not come to call righteous men, but sinners, to reformation.’</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then come to him do the disciples of John, saying, ‘Wherefore do we and the Pharisees fast much, and thy disciples fast not?’</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Jesus said to them, ‘Can the sons of the bride-chamber mourn, so long as the bridegroom is with them? but days shall come when the bridegroom may be taken from them, and then they shall fast.</verse>
  <verse number="16">‘And no one doth put a patch of undressed cloth on an old garment, for its filling up doth take from the garment, and a worse rent is made.</verse>
  <verse number="17">‘Nor do they put new wine into old skins, and if not—the skins burst, and the wine doth run out, and the skins are destroyed, but they put new wine into new skins, and both are preserved together.’</verse>
  <verse number="18">While he is speaking these things to them, lo, a ruler having come, was bowing to him, saying that ‘My daughter just now died, but, having come, lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.’</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Jesus having risen, did follow him, also his disciples,</verse>
  <verse number="20">and lo, a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, having come to him behind, did touch the fringe of his garments,</verse>
  <verse number="21">for she said within herself, ‘If only I may touch his garment, I shall be saved.’</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Jesus having turned about, and having seen her, said, ‘Be of good courage, daughter, thy faith hath saved thee,’ and the woman was saved from that hour.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Jesus having come to the house of the ruler, and having seen the minstrels and the multitude making tumult,</verse>
  <verse number="24">he saith to them, ‘Withdraw, for the damsel did not die, but doth sleep,’ and they were deriding him;</verse>
  <verse number="25">but, when the multitude was put forth, having gone in, he took hold of her hand, and the damsel arose,</verse>
  <verse number="26">and the fame of this went forth to all the land.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And Jesus passing on thence, two blind men followed him, calling and saying, ‘Deal kindly with us, Son of David.’</verse>
  <verse number="28">And he having come to the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus saith to them, ‘Believe ye that I am able to do this?’ They say to him, ‘Yes, sir.’</verse>
  <verse number="29">Then touched he their eyes, saying, ‘According to your faith let it be to you,’</verse>
  <verse number="30">and their eyes were opened, and Jesus strictly charged them, saying, ‘See, let no one know;’</verse>
  <verse number="31">but they, having gone forth, did spread his fame in all that land.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And as they are coming forth, lo, they brought to him a man dumb, a demoniac,</verse>
  <verse number="33">and the demon having been cast out, the dumb spake, and the multitude did wonder, saying that ‘It was never so seen in Israel:’</verse>
  <verse number="34">but the Pharisees said, ‘By the ruler of the demons he doth cast out the demons.’</verse>
  <verse number="35">And Jesus was going up and down all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the reign, and healing every sickness and every malady among the people.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And having seen the multitudes, he was moved with compassion for them, that they were faint and cast aside, as sheep not having a shepherd,</verse>
  <verse number="37">then saith he to his disciples, ‘The harvest indeed is abundant, but the workmen few;</verse>
  <verse number="38">beseech ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he may put forth workmen to His harvest.’</verse>
