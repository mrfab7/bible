<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities! all is vanity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">What profit hath man of all his labour wherewith he laboureth under the sun?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">[One] generation passeth away, and [another] generation cometh, but the earth standeth for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The sun also riseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to its place where it ariseth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The wind goeth towards the south, and turneth about towards the north: it turneth about continually, and the wind returneth again to its circuits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full: unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">All things are full of toil; none can express it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which will be done: and there is nothing new under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? It hath been already in the ages which were before us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be remembrance of things that are to come with those who shall live afterwards.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And I applied my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the heavens: this grievous occupation hath God given to the children of men to weary themselves therewith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and pursuit of the wind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I have become great and have acquired wisdom more than all they that have been before me over Jerusalem; and my heart hath seen much of wisdom and knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And I applied my heart to the knowledge of wisdom, and to the knowledge of madness and folly: I perceived that this also is a striving after the wind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For in much wisdom is much vexation, and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</p>
