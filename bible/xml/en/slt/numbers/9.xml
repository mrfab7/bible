  <verse number="6">And there shall be men who were unclean by the soul of man, and they will not be able to do the passover in that day: and they came near before Moses and before Aaron, in that day:</verse>

  <verse number="15">And in the day of the raising up the dwelling the cloud covered the dwelling of the tent of testimony: and in the evening it shall be upon the tent as the appearance of fire till morning.</verse>

  <verse number="17">And when the cloud went up from the tent, and after this the sons of Israel shall remove: and in the place where the cloud shall dwell there, there shall the sons of Israel encamp.</verse>
  <verse number="18">At the mouth of Jehovah the sons of Israel will remove, and at the mouth of Jehovah they will encamp: all the days which the cloud shall dwell upon the dwelling they shall encamp.</verse>

  <verse number="22">Or days, or a month, or days, in the prolonging of the cloud upon the dwelling to dwell upon it, the sons of Israel shall encamp, and they shall not remove; and in its going up they shall remove.</verse>
  <verse number="23">At the mouth of Jehovah they shall encamp, and at the mouth of Jehovah, they shall remove; the watches of Jehovah they watched, at the mouth of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.</verse>
