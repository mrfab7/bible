<div class="chapter" data-book="Jonah" data-chapter="2" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jonah prayeth unto Jehovah his God from the bowels of the fish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he saith: I called, because of my distress, to Jehovah, And He doth answer me, From the belly of sheol I have cried, Thou hast heard my voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">When Thou dost cast me into the deep, Into the heart of the seas, Then the flood doth compass me, All Thy breakers and Thy billows have passed over me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I—I said: I have been cast out from before Thine eyes, (Yet I add to look unto Thy holy temple!)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Compassed me have waters unto the soul, The deep doth compass me, The weed is bound to my head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">To the cuttings of mountains I have come down, The earth, her bars are behind me to the age. And Thou bringest up from the pit my life, O Jehovah my God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In the feebleness within me of my soul Jehovah I have remembered, And come in unto Thee doth my prayer, Unto Thy holy temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Those observing lying vanities their own mercy forsake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And I—with a voice of thanksgiving—I sacrifice to Thee, That which I have vowed I complete, Salvation is of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Jehovah saith to the fish, and it vomiteth out Jonah on the dry land.</p>
