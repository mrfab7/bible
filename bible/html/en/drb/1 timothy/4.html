<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Timothy" data-chapter="4" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now the Spirit manifestly saith, that in the last times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to spirits of error, and doctrines of devils,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Speaking lies in hypocrisy, and having their conscience seared,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Forbidding to marry, to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by the faithful, and by them that have known the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be rejected that is received with thanksgiving:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">These things proposing to the brethren, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished up in the words of faith, and of the good doctrine which thou hast attained unto.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But avoid foolish and old wivesâ€™ fables: and exercise thyself unto godliness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For bodily exercise is profitable to little: but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For therefore we labor and are reviled, because we hope in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, especially of the faithful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">These things command and teach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let no man despise thy youth: but be thou an example of the faithful in word, in conversation, in charity, in faith, in chastity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Till I come, attend unto reading, to exhortation, and to doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Neglect not the grace that is in thee, which was given thee by prophesy, with imposition of the hands of the priesthood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Meditate upon these things, be wholly in these things: that thy profiting may be manifest to all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Take heed to thyself and to doctrine: be earnest in them. For in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that hear thee.</p>
