<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Therefore, my brethren, dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, thus stand ye in the Lord, dearly beloved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I beseech Euodias, and I beseech Syntyche, to think the same in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I also ask thee, worthy yoke fellow, aid those women who fought in company with me in the good news, and with Clement, and the rest of my co-workers, whose names in the book of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Rejoice in the Lord always: again say I, Do ye rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Let your fitness be known to all men. The Lord is near.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Rave anxiety about nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with gratitude let your desires be made known to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the peace of God, surpassing all understanding, shall watch your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">As to the rest, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever venerable, whatever just, whatever pure, whatever lovely, whatever prosperous; if any ability, and if any praise, reckon up these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And what things ye learned, and received, and heard, and saw in me, these do; and the God of peace shall be with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that once already ye recovered new vigor; for thinking of me, upon whom ye were thinking, and ye had not time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Not that I speak concerning want; for I have learned, among whom I am, to be satisfied with my condition.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And I know how to be humble, and I know how to abound in every thing: and in all I am instructed also to be full and to hunger, and to abound and to be in want.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">I am strong for all things in Christ strengthening me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But ye did well, participating together in my pressure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And ye also know, Philippians, that in the beginning of the good news, when I went out from Macedonia, no church participated with me in the word of donation and accepting, except ye alone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For also in Thessalonica, and once, and twice, ye sent to my necessity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Not that I covet a gift: but I covet fruit abounding to your word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And I have all, and abound: I have been filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things from you, a smell of sweet odor, a sacrifice acceptable, pleasing to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And God will fill up all your need according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And to God and our Father the glory for the times of times. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Greet ye every one holy in Christ Jesus. The brethren with me greet you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">All the holy greet you, and chiefly they from Caesarâ€™s house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you all. Amen.</p>
