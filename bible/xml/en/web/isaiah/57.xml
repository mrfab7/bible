<chapter book="Isaiah" number="57" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He enters into peace; they rest in their beds, each one who walks in his uprightness.</verse>
  <verse number="3">“But draw near here, you sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the prostitute.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Against whom do you sport yourselves? Against whom do you make a wide mouth, and stick out your tongue? Aren’t you children of disobedience, a seed of falsehood,</verse>
  <verse number="5">you who inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree; who kill the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Among the smooth stones of the valley is your portion; they, they are your lot; you have even poured a drink offering to them. You have offered an offering. Shall I be appeased for these things?</verse>
  <verse number="7">On a high and lofty mountain you have set your bed; there also you went up to offer sacrifice.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Behind the doors and the posts you have set up your memorial: for you have uncovered to someone besides me, and have gone up; you have enlarged your bed, and made you a covenant with them: you loved their bed where you saw it.</verse>
  <verse number="9">You went to the king with oil, and increased your perfumes, and sent your ambassadors far off, and debased yourself even to Sheol.</verse>
  <verse number="10">You were wearied with the length of your way; yet you didn’t say, ‘It is in vain.’ You found a reviving of your strength; therefore you weren’t faint.</verse>
  <verse number="11">“Of whom have you been afraid and in fear, that you lie, and have not remembered me, nor laid it to your heart? Haven’t I held my peace even of long time, and you don’t fear me?</verse>
  <verse number="12">I will declare your righteousness; and as for your works, they shall not profit you.</verse>
  <verse number="13">When you cry, let those who you have gathered deliver you; but the wind shall take them, a breath shall carry them all away: but he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">He will say, “Cast up, cast up, prepare the way, take up the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: “I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For I will not contend forever, neither will I be always angry; for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls who I have made.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry, and struck him; I hid myself and was angry; and he went on backsliding in the way of his heart.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.</verse>
  <verse number="19">I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him who is far off and to him who is near,” says Yahweh; “and I will heal them.”</verse>
  <verse number="20">But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it can’t rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.</verse>
  <verse number="21">“There is no peace,” says my God, “for the wicked.”</verse>
