<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Words of Lemuel a king, a declaration that his mother taught him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">‘What, my son? and what, son of my womb? And what, son of my vows?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Give not to women thy strength, And thy ways to wiping away of kings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Not for kings, O Lemuel, Not for kings, to drink wine, And for princes a desire of strong drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Lest he drink, and forget the decree, And change the judgment of any of the sons of affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Give strong drink to the perishing, And wine to the bitter in soul,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He drinketh, and forgetteth his poverty, And his misery he remembereth not again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Open thy mouth for the dumb, For the right of all sons of change.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Open thy mouth, judge righteously, Both the cause of the poor and needy!’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A woman of worth who doth find? Yea, far above rubies is her price.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The heart of her husband hath trusted in her, And spoil he lacketh not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">She hath done him good, and not evil, All days of her life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">She hath sought wool and flax, And with delight she worketh with her hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">She hath been as ships of the merchant, From afar she bringeth in her bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Yea, she riseth while yet night, And giveth food to her household, And a portion to her damsels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">She hath considered a field, and taketh it, From the fruit of her hands she hath planted a vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">She hath girded with might her loins, And doth strengthen her arms.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">She hath perceived when her merchandise is good, Her lamp is not extinguished in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Her hands she hath sent forth on a spindle, And her hands have held a distaff.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Her hand she hath spread forth to the poor, Yea, her hands she sent forth to the needy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">She is not afraid of her household from snow, For all her household are clothed with scarlet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Ornamental coverings she hath made for herself, Silk and purple are her clothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Known in the gates is her husband, In his sitting with elders of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Linen garments she hath made, and selleth, And a girdle she hath given to the merchant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Strength and honour are her clothing, And she rejoiceth at a latter day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Her mouth she hath opened in wisdom, And the law of kindness is on her tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">She is watching the ways of her household, And bread of sloth she eateth not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Her sons have risen up, and pronounce her happy, Her husband, and he praiseth her,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Many are the daughters who have done worthily, Thou hast gone up above them all.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The grace is false, and the beauty is vain, A woman fearing Jehovah, she may boast herself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Give ye to her of the fruit of her hands, And her works do praise her in the gates!</p>
