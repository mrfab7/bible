<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say to them, To the shepherds, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Wo! to the shepherds of Israel who were feeding themselves: shall not the shepherds feed the sheep?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Ye will eat the fat, and ye will put on the wool, ye will sacrifice the fatlings: ye will not feed the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Ye strengthened not the sickly, and the diseased ye healed not, and the broken ye bound not up, and the thrust away ye turned not back, and the lost ye sought not; and with force and with oppression ye ruled them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And they will be scattered from Without a shepherd: and they will be for consuming to all the beasts of the field, and they will be scattered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">My sheep will wander upon all the mountains, and upon every high hill: and upon all the face of the earth my flock was scattered, and none searching and none seeking.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For this, hear ye shepherds, the word of Jehovah:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I live, says the Lord Jehovah, if not my sheep were for plunder and my sheep will be for consuming to all the beasts of the field from no shepherd; and the shepherds sought not my sheep, and the shepherds will feed themselves, and my sheep they fed not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For this, hear ye shepherds, the word of Jehovah:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against the shepherds; and I sought my flock from their hand, and I caused them to cease from feeding the sheep: and the shepherds shall no more feed themselves; and I delivered my flock from their face, and they shall not be to them for consuming.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me. I also sought my sheep, and I searched them out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">According to the seeking of the shepherd of his flock in the day of his being in the midst of his sheep being scattered; so will I search out my sheep and deliver them from all places where they were scattered there in the day of cloud and darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And I brought them out from the peoples, and I gathered them from the lands, and I brought them to their land, and I fed them upon the mountains of Israel by the torrents, and in all the dwellings of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">In a good pasture will I feed them, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall be their rest: there shall they lie in a good rest, and a fat pasture they shall feed upon the mountains of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I will feed my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down, says the Lord Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The lost I will seek out, and the thrust away I will turn back, and to the broken I will bind up, and the diseased I will strengthen: and the fat and the strong I will destroy; I will feed them with judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And ye, my sheep, thus said the Lord Jehovah; Behold me judging between sheep to sheep, to the rams and to the he goats.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Is it small for you ye will feed the good pasture, and the remainder of your pastures ye will tread down with your feet? and ye will drink front the settled waters and that being left they will tread with your feet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And my sheep will feed of the trodden down of your feet; and they will drink of the treading of your feet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah to them: Behold me I also judged between fat sheep and between lean sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Because with side and with shoulder ye will thrust away, and with your horns ye pushed all the sickly till that ye scattered them without;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And I saved my sheep, and they shall no more be for plunder; and I judged between sheep to sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And I raised up one shepherd over them, and he fed them, my servant David; he shall feed them and he shall be to them for shepherd.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">I Jehovah will be to them for God, and my servant David a prince in the midst of them; I Jehovah spake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And I cut out to them a covenant of peace, and I caused the evil beast to cease from the land: and they dwelt with confidence in the desert, and they slept in the forests.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And I gave them and round about my hill a blessing; and I brought down the rain in its time, and they shall be rains of blessing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And the tree of the field gave its fruit, and the land shall give her produce, and they shall be upon their land with confidence, and they knew that I am Jehovah in my breaking the rods of their yoke; and I delivered them from the hand of those serving themselves in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And they shall no more be plunder to the nations, and the beast of the earth shall not eat them; and they dwelt confidently and none making afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And I raised up to them a plant for a name, and they shall be no more taken away by famine in the land, and they shall no more bear the shame of the nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And they knew that I Jehovah their God with them, and they my people, the house of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And ye my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, ye are men, I your God, says the Lord Jehovah.</p>
