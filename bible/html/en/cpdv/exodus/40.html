<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“In the first month, on the first day of the month, you shall raise the tabernacle of the testimony,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and you shall place the ark in it, and you shall release the veil before it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And having brought in the table, you shall place the things which were solemnly commanded upon it. The lampstand shall stand with its lamps,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and the altar of gold, in which the incense is burned, shall stand before the ark of the testimony. You shall place the tent at the entrance of the tabernacle,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and before it, the altar of holocaust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The washtub shall stand between the altar and the tabernacle, and you shall fill it with water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And you shall encompass the atrium and its entrance with hangings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And, having taken up the oil of unction, you shall anoint the tabernacle along with its articles, so that they may be sanctified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The altar of holocaust and all its vessels,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">the washtub with its base, and all things, you shall consecrate with the oil of unction, so that they may be the Holy of holies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And you shall bring forward Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the tabernacle of the testimony, and, having washed them with water,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">- - -</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">- - -</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">you shall clothe them in the holy vestments, so that they may minister to me, and so that their unction may accomplish an everlasting priesthood.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Moses did all that the Lord had instructed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Therefore, in the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was put in place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Moses raised it up, and he positioned the panels as well as the bases and the bars, and he set up the columns,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and he stretched out the roof over the tabernacle, imposing a cover above it, just as the Lord had decreed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And he placed the testimony in the ark, applying the bars beneath, and the oracle above.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And when he had brought the ark into the tabernacle, he drew the veil before it, in order to fulfill the commandment of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And he placed the table in the tabernacle of the testimony, at the north side, beyond the veil,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">arranging before it the bread of the presence, just as the Lord had instructed Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And he placed the lampstand in the tabernacle of the testimony, away from the table, on the south side,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">setting the lamps in order, according to the precept of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He also positioned the altar of gold under the roof of the testimony, opposite the veil,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">and he heaped upon it the incense of aromatics, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And he positioned the tent at the entrance of the tabernacle of the testimony,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">and the altar of holocaust in the vestibule of the testimony, offering the holocaust and the sacrifices upon it, just as the Lord had decreed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Likewise, he stationed the washtub between the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar, filling it with water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And Moses and Aaron, along with his sons, washed their hands and feet,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">whenever they would enter the covering of the covenant, and when they approached to the altar, just as the Lord had instructed Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And he raised up the atrium around the tabernacle and the altar, drawing the hanging at its entrance. After all these things were perfected,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">the cloud covered the tabernacle of the testimony, and the glory of the Lord filled it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Neither could Moses enter the covering of the covenant: the cloud was covering all things, and the majesty of the Lord was flashing. For the cloud had covered everything.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Whenever the cloud departed from the tabernacle, the sons of Israel set out by their companies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">But if it remained hanging over it, they remained in the same place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">Certainly, the cloud of the Lord lay over the tabernacle by day, and the fire by night, being seen by all the people of Israel throughout all their resting places.</p>
