<chapter book="Isaiah" number="10" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Woe to those who enact unjust statutes and issue oppressive decrees,</verse>
  <verse number="2">to deprive the poor of fair treatment and withhold justice from the oppressed of My people, to make widows their prey and orphans their plunder.</verse>
  <verse number="3">What will you do on the day of reckoning when devastation comes from afar? To whom will you flee for help? Where will you leave your wealth?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Nothing will remain but to crouch among the captives or fall among the slain. Despite all this, His anger is not turned away; His hand is still upraised.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Woe to Assyria, the rod of My anger; the staff in their hands is My wrath.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I will send him against a godless nation; I will dispatch him against a people destined for My rage, to take spoils and seize plunder, and to trample them down like clay in the streets.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But this is not his intention; this is not his plan. For it is in his heart to destroy and cut off many nations.</verse>
  <verse number="8">“Are not all my commanders kings?” he says.</verse>
  <verse number="9">“Is not Calno like Carchemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Samaria like Damascus?</verse>
  <verse number="10">As my hand seized the idolatrous kingdoms whose images surpassed those of Jerusalem and Samaria,</verse>
  <verse number="11">and as I have done to Samaria and its idols, will I not also do to Jerusalem and her idols?”</verse>
  <verse number="12">So when the Lord has completed all His work against Mount Zion and Jerusalem, He will say, “I will punish the king of Assyria for the fruit of his arrogant heart and the proud look in his eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For he says: ‘By the strength of my hand I have done this, and by my wisdom, for I am clever. I have removed the boundaries of nations and plundered their treasures; like a mighty one I subdued their rulers.</verse>
  <verse number="14">My hand reached as into a nest to seize the wealth of the nations. Like one gathering abandoned eggs, I gathered all the earth. No wing fluttered, no beak opened or chirped.’”</verse>
  <verse number="15">Does an axe raise itself above the one who swings it? Does a saw boast over him who saws with it? It would be like a rod waving the one who lifts it, or a staff lifting him who is not wood!</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore the Lord GOD of Hosts will send a wasting disease among Assyria’s stout warriors, and under his pomp will be kindled a fire like a burning flame.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the Light of Israel will become a fire, and its Holy One a flame. In a single day it will burn and devour Assyria’s thorns and thistles.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The splendor of its forests and orchards, both soul and body, it will completely destroy, as a sickness consumes a man.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The remaining trees of its forests will be so few that a child could count them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">On that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no longer depend on him who struck them, but they will truly rely on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="21">A remnant will return—a remnant of Jacob—to the Mighty God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Though your people, O Israel, be like the sand of the sea, only a remnant will return. Destruction has been decreed, overflowing with righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For the Lord GOD of Hosts will carry out the destruction decreed upon the whole land.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore this is what the Lord GOD of Hosts says: “O My people who dwell in Zion, do not fear Assyria, who strikes you with a rod and lifts his staff against you as the Egyptians did.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For in just a little while My fury against you will subside, and My anger will turn to their destruction.”</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the LORD of Hosts will brandish a whip against them, as when He struck Midian at the rock of Oreb. He will raise His staff over the sea, as He did in Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="27">On that day the burden will be lifted from your shoulders, and the yoke from your neck. The yoke will be broken because your neck will be too large.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Assyria has entered Aiath and passed through Migron, storing their supplies at Michmash.</verse>
  <verse number="29">They have crossed at the ford: “We will spend the night at Geba.” Ramah trembles; Gibeah of Saul flees.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Cry aloud, O Daughter of Gallim! Listen, O Laishah! O wretched Anathoth!</verse>
  <verse number="31">Madmenah flees; the people of Gebim take refuge.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Yet today they will halt at Nob, shaking a fist at the mount of Daughter Zion, at the hill of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Behold, the Lord GOD of Hosts will lop off the branches with terrifying power. The tall trees will be cut down, the lofty ones will be felled.</verse>
  <verse number="34">He will clear the forest thickets with an axe, and Lebanon will fall before the Mighty One.</verse>
