<chapter book="Titus" number="3" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,</verse>
  <verse number="2">to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,</verse>
  <verse number="5">not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,</verse>
  <verse number="6">whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;</verse>
  <verse number="7">that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
  <verse number="8">This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;</verse>
  <verse number="9">but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;</verse>
  <verse number="11">knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.</verse>
  <verse number="12">When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.</verse>
  <verse number="15">All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</verse>
