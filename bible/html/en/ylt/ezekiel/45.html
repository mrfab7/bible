<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And in your causing the land to fall in inheritance, ye lift up a heave-offering to Jehovah, a holy portion of the land: the length—five and twenty thousand is the length, and the breadth ten thousand; it is holy in all its border round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">There is of this for the sanctuary five hundred by five hundred, square, round about; and fifty cubits of suburb is to it round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And by this measure thou dost measure: the length is five and twenty thousand, and the breadth ten thousand: and in it is the sanctuary, the holy of holies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The holy portion of the land it is; for priests, ministrants of the sanctuary, it is, who are drawing near to serve Jehovah; and it hath been to them a place for houses, and a holy place for a sanctuary.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">‘And of the five and twenty thousand of length, and of the ten thousand of breadth, there is to the Levites, ministrants of the house, for them—for a possession—twenty chambers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And of the possession of the city ye give five thousand of breadth, and of length five and twenty thousand, over-against the heave-offering of the holy portion: to all the house of Israel it is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">As to the prince, on this side, and on that side, of the heave-offering of the holy place, and of the possession of the city, at the front of the heave-offering of the holy place, and at the front of the possession of the city, from the west corner westward, and from the east corner eastward—and the length is over-against one of the portions from the west border unto the east border—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">of the land there is to him for a possession in Israel, and My princes do not oppress any more My people, and the land they give to the house of Israel according to their tribes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">‘Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Enough to you—princes of Israel; violence and spoil turn aside, and judgment and righteousness do; lift up your exactions from off My people—an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath—ye have.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The ephah and the bath is of one measure, for the bath to bear a tenth of the homer, and the ephah a tenth of the homer: according to the homer is its measurement.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And, the shekel is twenty gerah: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels—is your maneh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">This is the heave-offering that ye lift up; a sixth part of the ephah of a homer of wheat, also ye have given a sixth part of the ephah of a homer of barley,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and the portion of oil, the bath of oil, a tenth part of the bath out of the cor, a homer of ten baths—for ten baths are a homer;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the watered country of Israel, for a present, and for a burnt-offering, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement by them—an affirmation of the Lord Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">All the people of the land are at this heave-offering for the prince in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And on the prince are the burnt-offerings, and the present, and the libation, in feasts, and in new moons, and in sabbaths, in all appointed times of the house of Israel: he doth make the sin-offering, and the present, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offerings, to make atonement for the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In the first month, in the first of the month, thou dost take a bullock, a son of the herd, a perfect one, and hast cleansed the sanctuary:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and the priest hath taken of the blood of the sin offering, and hath put on the door-post of the house, and on the four corners of the border of the altar, and on the post of the gate of the inner court.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And so thou dost do on the seventh of the month, because of each erring one, and because of the simple one—and ye have purified the house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye have the passover, a feast of seven days, unleavened food is eaten.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the prince hath prepared on that day, for himself, and for all the people of the land, a bullock, a sin-offering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And the seven days of the feast he prepareth a burnt-offering to Jehovah, seven bullocks, and seven rams, perfect ones, daily seven days, and a sin-offering, a kid of the goats, daily.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And a present of an ephah for a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, he doth prepare, and of oil a hin for an ephah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, in the feast, he doth according to these things seven days; as the sin-offering so the burnt-offering, and as the present so also the oil.</p>
