  <verse number="1">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you be come into the land of your habitations, which I give to you,</verse>
  <verse number="3">And will make an offering by fire to the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet smell to the LORD, of the herd or of the flock:</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then shall he that offers his offering to the LORD bring a meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of oil.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shall you prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Or for a ram, you shall prepare for a meat offering two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And for a drink offering you shall offer the third part of an hin of wine, for a sweet smell to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And when you prepare a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings to the LORD:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And you shall bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine, for an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a lamb, or a kid.</verse>
  <verse number="12">According to the number that you shall prepare, so shall you do to every one according to their number.</verse>
  <verse number="13">All that are born of the country shall do these things after this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whoever be among you in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD; as you do, so he shall do.</verse>
  <verse number="15">One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojournes with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations: as you are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="16">One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger that sojournes with you.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="18">Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you come into the land where I bring you,</verse>
  <verse number="19">Then it shall be, that, when you eat of the bread of the land, you shall offer up an heave offering to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="20">You shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave offering: as you do the heave offering of the threshing floor, so shall you heave it.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Of the first of your dough you shall give to the LORD an heave offering in your generations.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And if you have erred, and not observed all these commandments, which the LORD has spoken to Moses,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Even all that the LORD has commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations;</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet smell to the LORD, with his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire to the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:</verse>
  <verse number="26">And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojournes among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year for a sin offering.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that sins ignorantly, when he sins by ignorance before the LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.</verse>
  <verse number="29">You shall have one law for him that sins through ignorance, both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojournes among them.</verse>
  <verse number="30">But the soul that does ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproaches the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Because he has despised the word of the LORD, and has broken his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his iniquity shall be on him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered sticks on the sabbath day.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And they that found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should be done to him.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the LORD said to Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="38">Speak to the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the fringe of the borders a ribbon of blue:</verse>
  <verse number="39">And it shall be to you for a fringe, that you may look on it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that you seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which you use to go a whoring:</verse>
  <verse number="40">That you may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God.</verse>
  <verse number="41">I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.</verse>
