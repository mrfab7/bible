<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And having looked up, he saw the rich casting their gifts into the royal treasury.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he also saw a certain poor widow casting there two small coins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he said, Truly I say to you, that this poor widow has cast in more than all:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For all they, of that abounding to them, have cast in to the gifts of God: and she from her want cast in all the living which she had.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And certain speaking of the temple, that it has been arranged with beautiful stones and decorations, he said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">These which ye see, the days shall come, in which stone shall not be left upon stone, which shall not be loosened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And they asked him, saying, Teacher, when therefore shall these be and what the sign when these should be about to be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he said, See ye, be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, That I am; and the time has drawn near: therefore go not after them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And when ye hear of wars and tumults, be not terrified: for these must first be; but the end not immediately.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then said he to them, Nation shall be raised up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And great earthquakes in places, and famines, and scourges shall be; and terrific objects and great signs shall be from heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And before all these shall they cast their hands upon you, and drive out, delivering to assemblies, and prisons, being brought before kings and leaders for my name’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And it shall turn out to you for a testimony.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Set therefore in your hearts, not to practise beforehand to justify yourselves:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all they opposed to you shall not be able to contradict nor withstand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And ye shall also be delivered up by parents, and brethren, and kinsmen, and friends; and they shall put of you to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And ye shall be hated by all for my name’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And there shall not a hair of your head perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">In your patience possess ye your souls.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And when ye see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its devastation has drawn near.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Then let those in Judea flee to the mountain; and those in the midst of her withdraw; and let those in the countries not go into her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For these are the days of vengeance, that all things having been written, should be completed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And woe to them having in the womb, and to them giving suck, in those days! for there shall be great necessity upon the land, and anger upon this people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And they shall fall by the mouth of the sword, and they shall be made captives in all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by all the nations, till the times of the nations should be completed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And signs shall be in the sun, and moon, and stars; and upon earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and commotion resounding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Men losing breath for fear and expectation of things coming on the habitable globe: for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with much power and glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And these things beginning to be, get out of danger, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draws near.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And he spake to them a parable; See the fig tree, and all trees;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">When they should already throw forth, seeing of yourselves ye know that summer is already near.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">So also ye, when ye see these being, know that the kingdom of God is near.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Truly I say to you, That this generation should not pass away, even till all things should be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Heaven and earth shall pass away: and my words shall not pass away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And attend to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be loaded with dizziness, caused by excess, and drunkenness, and cares of life, and that day come upon you unexpectedly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">For as a snare shall it come upon all remaining upon the face of all, the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Watch therefore, in all time praying, that ye be deemed worthy to escape all these about to be, and to stand before the Son of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And the days he was teaching in the temple; and the nights, coming out, he lodged in the mount called of Olives.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And all the people arose early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him.</p>
