<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a flying roll.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he said to me, What see you? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then said he to me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth: for every one that steals shall be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that swears shall be cut off as on that side according to it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I will bring it forth, said the LORD of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that swears falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the middle of his house, and shall consume it with the timber thereof and the stones thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said to me, Lift up now your eyes, and see what is this that goes forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that goes forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance through all the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a woman that sits in the middle of the ephah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the middle of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead on the mouth thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then lifted I up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Where do these bear the ephah?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And he said to me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there on her own base.</p>
