<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Avenge the avenging of the sons of Israel of the Midianites: afterwards thou shalt be gathered to thy people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Moses will speak to the people, saying, Arm from yourselves the men for war, and they shall be against Midian, to give the avenging of Jehovah upon Midian.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A thousand to a tribe, a thousand to a tribe, for all the tribes of Israel, ye shall send to war.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And there shall be separated from the thousands of Israel a thousand for a tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Moses will send them a thousand for a tribe, to war, them and Phinehas, son of Eleazar the priest, to war, and the holy vessels, and the trumpets of the signal in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And they will go forth against Midian as Jehovah commanded Moses; and they killed every male.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And they killed the kings of Midian upon those being slain: Evi and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: and they killed Balaam, son of Beor, with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the sons of Israel will take captive the women of Midian and their little ones, and all their cattle, and all their possessions, and they plundered all their strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And their cities with their dwellings, and all their walls they burnt in fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And they will take all the plunder and all the spoil, in man and in cattle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And they will bring to Moses and to Eleazar the priest, and to the assembly of the sons of Israel, the captivity and the spoil and the plunder, to the camp to the desert of Moab, which is by Jordan of Jericho.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Moses and Eleazar the priest, and all the chiefs of the assembly will come forth to their meeting without the camp.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Moses will be angry against the officers of the army, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds coming from the war of the battle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Moses will say to them, Preserved ye alive every female?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Behold, they were to the sons of Israel by the word of Balaam for separating treacherously against Jehovah, concerning the word of Peor; and there will be a smiting in the assembly of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And now kill every male among the little ones; and every woman know in man by the bed of a male, do ye kill.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And all the little ones among the women who knew not the bed of a male, preserve ye alive for yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And encamp ye without the camp seven days: every one killing a soul, and every one touching upon the wounded, ye shall be purified in the third day, and in the seventh day, ye and your captivity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And every garment and every vessel of skin, and every work of goats’ hair, and every vessel of wood, ye shall purify.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Eleazar the priest will say to the men of war coming from the battle, This the law of instruction which Jehovah commanded Moses:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Only the gold and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Every thing which shall come through fire ye shall make pass through fire, and it was cleansed: only with the water of uncleanness shall it be purified: and all which will not come through the fire ye shall make pass through the water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And wash ye your garments in the seventh day, and be purified, and afterwards ye shall come into the camp.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Take the head of the spoil of the captivity, in man and in cattle, thou and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers of the assembly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And divide the spoil between them taking hold of the battle, going forth to war, and between all the assembly:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And cast a tribute to Jehovah from the men of the battle going forth to war: one soul from five hundred, from the men and from the oxen, and from the asses, and from the sheep:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Ye shall take from their half and give it to Eleazar the priest, an offering of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And from the sons of Israel’s half thou shalt take one taking from fifty, from the men, from the oxen, from the asses, and from the sheep, from all the cattle, and give them to the Levites watching the watches of the dwelling of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And Moses will do, and Eleazar the priest, as the Lord commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And the remainder of the spoil plundered which the people of war plundered, will be six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And the oxen two and seventy thousand,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And the asses, one and sixty thousand,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And the souls of man, from the women which knew not the bed of a male all the souls, two and thirty thousand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And half of the portion of those having gone forth in the war, the Numbers of the sheep will be three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And the tribute to Jehovah will be from the sheep, six hundred five and seventy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And the oxen, six and thirty thousand; and their tribute to Jehovah, two and seventy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And the asses thirty thousand and five hundred; and their tribute to Jehovah, one and sixty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And the souls of man, sixteen thousand; and their tribute to Jehovah, two and thirty souls.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And Moses will give the tribute, an offering of Jehovah, to Eleazar the priest, as Jehovah commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And from the sons of Israel’s half which Moses divided from the men having warred,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">(And the assembly’s half from the sheep, will be three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand five hundred,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And the oxen, six and thirty thousand,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">And the asses, thirty thousand and five hundred,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">And the souls of man, sixteen thousand;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">Moses will take from the sons of Israel’s half, one taking from fifty, from man and from cattle, and he will give them to the Levites watching the watches of the tent of Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">And there will come near to Moses the officers which are over the thousands of the war, captains of thousands and captains of hundreds:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">And they will say to Moses, Thy servants took the head of the men of the battle which are in our hand, and a man was not missed from us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">And we will bring an offering to Jehovah, what each found, vessels of gold, armbands, and bracelets, rings, ear-rings, and globules of gold, to expiate for our souls before Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">And Moses will take, and Eleazar the priest, all the gold from them, all the vessels of work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">And all the gold of the offering which they lifted up to Jehovah, will be sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels, from the captains of thousands and from the captains of hundreds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">The men of war plundered each for himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">And Moses will take, and Eleazar the priest, the gold from the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and they will bring it to the tent of appointment, a remembrance for the sons of Israel before Jehovah.</p>
