<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Knowing, brethren beloved by God, your election.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">So that ye were examples to all that believe, in Macedonia and Achaia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For they themselves show of us what manner of entrance we had to you, and how ye turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, who delivered us from the wrath to come.</p>
