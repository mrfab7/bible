<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, forget not my law, and let thy heart keep my commandments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For they shall add to thee length of days, and years of life and peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Let not mercy and truth leave thee, put them about thy neck, and write them in the tables of thy heart:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And thou shalt And grace and good understanding before God and men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Have confidence in the Lord with all thy heart, and lean not upon thy own prudence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In all thy ways think on him, and he will direct thy steps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Be not wise in thy own conceit: fear God, and depart from evil:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For it shall be health to thy navel, and moistening to thy bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Honour the Lord with thy substance, and give him of the first of all thy fruits :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And thy barns shall be filled with abundance, and thy presses shall run over with wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My son, reject not the correction of the Lord: and do not faint when thou art chastised by him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For whom the Lord loveth, he chastiseth: and as a father in the son he pleaseth himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Blessed is the man that findeth wisdom and is rich in prudence:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The purchasing thereof is better than the merchandise of silver, and her fruit than the chiefest and purest gold:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">She is more precious than all riches : and all the things that are desired, are not to be compared with her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Length of days is in her right hand, and in her left hand riches and glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Her ways are beautiful ways, and all her paths are peaceable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her: and he that shall retain her is blessed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth, hath established the heavens by prudence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">By his wisdom the depths have broken out, and the clouds grow thick with dew</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">My son, let not these things depart from thy eyes: keep the law and counsel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And there shall be life to thy soul, and grace to thy mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Then shalt thou walk confidently in thy way, and thy foot shall not stumble:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">If thou sleep, thou shalt not fear: thou shalt rest, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Be not afraid of sudden fear, nor of the power of the wicked falling upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For the Lord will be at thy side, and will keep thy foot that thou be not taken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Do not withhold him from doing good, who is able: if thou art able, do good thyself also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Say not to thy friend: Go, and come again: and to morrow I will give to thee: when thou canst give at present.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Practise not evil against thy friend, when he hath confidence in thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Strive not against a man without cause, when he hath done thee no evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Envy not the unjust man, and do not follow his ways:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For every mocker is an abomination to the Lord, and his communication is with the simple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Want is from the Lord in the house of the wicked: but the habitations of the just shall be blessed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">He shall scorn the scorners, and to the meek he will give grace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">The wise shall possess glory: the promotion of fools is disgrace.</p>
