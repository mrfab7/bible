<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="7" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And of what ye wrote to me: good for a man not to touch a woman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And, on account of fornication, let each have his own wife, and let each have her own husband.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Let the husband return to the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife to the husband.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The wife of her own body has not power, but the husband: and likewise also the husband of his own body has not power, but the wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Deprive ye not one another, except somewhat of an agreement for a time, that ye might have leisure for fasting and prayer; and again upon the same ye might come together, lest Satan tempt you for your want of self command.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And this I say according to indulgence, not according to order.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For I will all men to be as also myself. But each has his own favor of God, the one truly thus, and the other thus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And I say to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they remain also as I.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And if they have not self command, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to be set on fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And to the married I announce, (not I, but the Lord,) The wife not to be separated from the husband:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And if also she be separated, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to the husband: and the husband not to send away the wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother have an unbelieving wife, and she assents to dwell with him, let him not send her away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he assents to dwell with her, let her not send him away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For the unbelieving husband was consecrated in the wife, and the unbelieving wife was consecrated in the husband: for then are our children unclean; and now are they holy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And if the unbelieving is separated, let him be separated. A brother or a sister has not been reduced to slavery in such things as these: and God has called us in peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For what knowest thou, O wife, if thou shalt save the husband or what knowest thou, O husband, if thou shalt save the wife?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Except as God divided to each, as the Lord has called each, so let him walk. And so I ordain in all the churches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Whoever was called circumcised? let him not be drawn to himself. Whoever was called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commands of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Each in the calling which he was called, in this let him remain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">A servant wert thou called? let it not concern thee: for if thou art able to be free, rather make use of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For the servant called in the Lord, is the freedman of the Lord: likewise also the freedman called, is the servant of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Ye were bought for a price; be ye not servants of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Each, in what he was called, brethren, in this let him remain with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But for virgins I have not an order of the Lord: and I give an opinion as compassionated by the Lord to be faithful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I think therefore this to be good for the present necessity, that it is good for a man to be thus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Hast thou been bound to a wife? seek not a release. Hast thou been loosed from a wife seek thou not a wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And if also thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she has not sinned. And such shall have pressure to the flesh: and I spare you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And this I say, brethren, the time is restricted; as to the rest, that they also having wives should be as not having;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And they weeping, as not weeping; and they rejoicing, as not rejoicing; and they buying, as not possessing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And they using this world, as not using; for the form of this world passes away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">But I will you to be free from care. The unmarried cares for things of the Lord, how he shall please the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And he married cares for the things of the world, how he shall please the wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">The wife and virgin have been divided. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, that she might be holy also in body and spirit: and she married cares for the things of the world, how she shall please her husband.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And this I say for the advantage of yourselves; not that I shall cast a net upon you, but for the becoming, and occupied assiduously for the Lord without being turned away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And if any think to act unbecomingly towards his virgin, if she be past the vigor of youth, and so it ought to be, let him do what he will, he sins not; let them marry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And he who has stood firmly fixed in heart; not having necessity, and has power concerning his own will, and has judged this in his heart to keep his virgin, does well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">So that he marrying does well; and he not marrying does better.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">The woman was bound by law for as much time as her husband lives; and if her husband be set to sleep, she is free to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And she is happier if she so remain, according to my opinion: and I also think to have the Spirit of God.</p>
