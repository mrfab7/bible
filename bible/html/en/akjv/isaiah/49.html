<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Listen, O isles, to me; and listen, you people, from far; The LORD has called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother has he made mention of my name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he has made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of his hand has he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his quiver has he hid me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And said to me, You are my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Then I said, I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nothing, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the LORD, and my work with my God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And now, said the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he said, It is a light thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give you for a light to the Gentiles, that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thus said the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Thus said the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard you, and in a day of salvation have I helped you: and I will preserve you, and give you for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">That you may say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in darkness, Show yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that has mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Behold, these shall come from far: and, see, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the LORD has comforted his people, and will have mercy on his afflicted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But Zion said, The LORD has forsaken me, and my Lord has forgotten me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? yes, they may forget, yet will I not forget you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Behold, I have graven you on the palms of my hands; your walls are continually before me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Your children shall make haste; your destroyers and they that made you waste shall go forth of you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Lift up your eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to you. As I live, said the LORD, you shall surely clothe you with them all, as with an ornament, and bind them on you, as a bride does.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For your waste and your desolate places, and the land of your destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed you up shall be far away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The children which you shall have, after you have lost the other, shall say again in your ears, The place is too strait for me: give place to me that I may dwell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Then shall you say in your heart, Who has begotten me these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro? and who has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they shall bring your sons in their arms, and your daughters shall be carried on their shoulders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And kings shall be your nursing fathers, and their queens your nursing mothers: they shall bow down to you with their face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of your feet; and you shall know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But thus said the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered: for I will contend with him that contends with you, and I will save your children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And I will feed them that oppress you with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am your Savior and your Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.</p>
