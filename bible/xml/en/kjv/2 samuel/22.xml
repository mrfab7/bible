  <verse number="1">And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day [that] the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he said, The LORD [is] my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;</verse>
  <verse number="3">The God of my rock; in him will I trust: [he is] my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou savest me from violence.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I will call on the LORD, [who is] worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="5">When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;</verse>
  <verse number="6">The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death prevented me;</verse>
  <verse number="7">In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry [did enter] into his ears.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven moved and shook, because he was wroth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness [was] under his feet.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters, [and] thick clouds of the skies.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Through the brightness before him were coals of fire kindled.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his voice.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and discomfited them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many waters;</verse>
  <verse number="18">He delivered me from my strong enemy, [and] from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</verse>
  <verse number="20">He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For all his judgments [were] before me: and [as for] his statutes, I did not depart from them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.</verse>
  <verse number="26">With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, [and] with the upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.</verse>
  <verse number="27">With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes [are] upon the haughty, [that] thou mayest bring [them] down.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For thou [art] my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped over a wall.</verse>
  <verse number="31">[As for] God, his way [is] perfect; the word of the LORD [is] tried: he [is] a buckler to all them that trust in him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For who [is] God, save the LORD? and who [is] a rock, save our God?</verse>
  <verse number="33">God [is] my strength [and] power: and he maketh my way perfect.</verse>
  <verse number="34">He maketh my feet like hinds’ [feet]: and setteth me upon my high places.</verse>
  <verse number="35">He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not slip.</verse>
  <verse number="38">I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not again until I had consumed them.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.</verse>
  <verse number="40">For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose up against me hast thou subdued under me.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might destroy them that hate me.</verse>
  <verse number="42">They looked, but [there was] none to save; [even] unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did stamp them as the mire of the street, [and] did spread them abroad.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people, thou hast kept me [to be] head of the heathen: a people [which] I knew not shall serve me.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they hear, they shall be obedient unto me.</verse>
  <verse number="46">Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of their close places.</verse>
  <verse number="47">The LORD liveth; and blessed [be] my rock; and exalted be the God of the rock of my salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="48">It [is] God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people under me,</verse>
  <verse number="49">And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</verse>
  <verse number="50">Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.</verse>
  <verse number="51">[He is] the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.</verse>
