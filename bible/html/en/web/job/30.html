<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“But now those who are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Of what use is the strength of their hands to me, men in whom ripe age has perished?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They are gaunt from lack and famine. They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of waste and desolation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They pluck salt herbs by the bushes. The roots of the broom are their food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">They are driven out from the midst of men. They cry after them as after a thief;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">So that they dwell in frightful valleys, and in holes of the earth and of the rocks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Among the bushes they bray; and under the nettles they are gathered together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They are children of fools, yes, children of base men. They were flogged out of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">“Now I have become their song. Yes, I am a byword to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They abhor me, they stand aloof from me, and don’t hesitate to spit in my face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For he has untied his cord, and afflicted me; and they have thrown off restraint before me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">On my right hand rise the rabble. They thrust aside my feet, They cast up against me their ways of destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They mar my path, They set forward my calamity, without anyone’s help.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">As through a wide breach they come, in the midst of the ruin they roll themselves in.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Terrors have turned on me. They chase my honor as the wind. My welfare has passed away as a cloud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">“Now my soul is poured out within me. Days of affliction have taken hold on me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">In the night season my bones are pierced in me, and the pains that gnaw me take no rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">By great force is my garment disfigured. It binds me about as the collar of my coat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He has cast me into the mire. I have become like dust and ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I cry to you, and you do not answer me. I stand up, and you gaze at me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">You have turned to be cruel to me. With the might of your hand you persecute me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">You lift me up to the wind, and drive me with it. You dissolve me in the storm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For I know that you will bring me to death, To the house appointed for all living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">“However doesn’t one stretch out a hand in his fall? Or in his calamity therefore cry for help?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Didn’t I weep for him who was in trouble? Wasn’t my soul grieved for the needy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">When I looked for good, then evil came; When I waited for light, there came darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">My heart is troubled, and doesn’t rest. Days of affliction have come on me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">I go mourning without the sun. I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">I am a brother to jackals, and a companion to ostriches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">My skin grows black and peels from me. My bones are burned with heat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Therefore my harp has turned to mourning, and my pipe into the voice of those who weep.</p>
