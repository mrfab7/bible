<chapter book="Job" number="28" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Surely there is for silver a source, And a place for the gold they refine;</verse>
  <verse number="2">Iron from the dust is taken, And from the firm stone brass.</verse>
  <verse number="3">An end hath he set to darkness, And to all perfection he is searching, A stone of darkness and death-shade.</verse>
  <verse number="4">A stream hath broken out from a sojourner, Those forgotten of the foot, They were low, from man they wandered.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The earth! from it cometh forth bread, And its under-part is turned like fire.</verse>
  <verse number="6">A place of the sapphire are its stones, And it hath dust of gold.</verse>
  <verse number="7">A path—not known it hath a ravenous fowl, Nor scorched it hath an eye of the kite,</verse>
  <verse number="8">Nor trodden it have the sons of pride, Not passed over it hath the fierce lion.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Against the flint he sent forth his hand, He overturned from the root mountains.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Among rocks, brooks he hath cleaved, And every precious thing hath his eye seen.</verse>
  <verse number="11">From overflowing floods he hath bound, And the hidden thing bringeth out to light.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the wisdom—whence is it found? And where is this, the place of understanding?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Man hath not known its arrangement, Nor is it found in the land of the living.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The deep hath said, ‘It is not in me,’ And the sea hath said, ‘It is not with me.’</verse>
  <verse number="15">Gold is not given for it, Nor is silver weighed—its price.</verse>
  <verse number="16">It is not valued with pure gold of Ophir, With precious onyx and sapphire,</verse>
  <verse number="17">Not equal it do gold and crystal, Nor is its exchange a vessel of fine gold.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Corals and pearl are not remembered, The acquisition of wisdom is above rubies.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Not equal it doth the topaz of Cush, With pure gold it is not valued.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the wisdom—whence doth it come? And where is this, the place of understanding?</verse>
  <verse number="21">It hath been hid from the eyes of all living. And from the fowl of the heavens It hath been hidden.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Destruction and death have said: ‘With our ears we have heard its fame.’</verse>
  <verse number="23">God hath understood its way, And He hath known its place.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For He to the ends of the earth doth look, Under the whole heavens He doth see,</verse>
  <verse number="25">To make for the wind a weight, And the waters He meted out in measure.</verse>
  <verse number="26">In His making for the rain a limit, And a way for the brightness of the voices,</verse>
  <verse number="27">Then He hath seen and declareth it, He hath prepared it, and also searched it out,</verse>
  <verse number="28">And He saith to man:—‘Lo, fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, And to turn from evil is understanding.’</verse>
