<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Call now, if there is answering thee; and to whom from the holy ones wilt thou turn?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For to the foolish, and anger will slay, and the simple will jealousy kill.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I saw the foolish one taking root, and suddenly I shall curse his habitation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">His sons shall be far from salvation, and they shall be crushed in the gate, and none delivering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Which his harvest the hungry one will devour, and not from thorns shall they take it, and destruction gaped after their substance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For toil will not come forth from the dust, and labor will not spring up from the earth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For man shall be born to labor as the sons of the flame will lift up to fly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But I will seek to God, and to God set my cause:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He did great things, and no searching; and wonders even no number:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He gave rain upon the face of the earth, and sent waters upon the out places:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">To raise up the humbled to height; and those mourning were exalted to salvation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Bringing to nought the purposes of the crafty, and their hand shall not do an undertaking.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He took the wise in their craftiness, and the counsel of the perverse was headlong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The days they will meet darkness, and they will grope in the noon day as night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he saved the needy from the sword, from their mouth and from the band of the strong one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And hope will be to the poor one, and iniquity contracted her mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Behold, happy the man God shall rebuke him: and thou shalt not reject the correction of the Almighty:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For he will cause pain, and he will bind up: he will smite and his hands will heal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">In six straits he will deliver thee, and in seven, evil shall not touch upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In famine he redeemed thee from death, and in war from the hands of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">In the scourge of the tongue thou shalt be hid, and thou shalt not be afraid of desolation when it shall come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">At desolation and at hunger thou shalt laugh, and from the beasts of the earth thou shalt not fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For with the stones of the field they covenant, and the beast of the field was at peace with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And thou knewest that thy tent is peace, and thou reviewedst thy dwelling, and thou shalt not sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And thou knewest the multitude of thy seed, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Thou shalt come in old age to thy grave, as the ascending of a heap of sheaves in its time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Behold this, we searched it out, so it is: hear it, and know thou for thyself.</p>
