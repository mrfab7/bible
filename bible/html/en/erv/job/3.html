<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Job answered and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night which said, There is a man child conceived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own; let a cloud dwell upon it; let all that maketh black the day terrify it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it: let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Lo, let that night be barren; let no joyful voice come therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark: let it look for light, but have none; neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Because it shut not up the doors of my motherâ€™s womb, nor hid trouble from mine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Why did the knees receive me? or why the breasts, that I should suck?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For now should I have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept; then had I been at rest:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">With kings and counsellors of the earth, which built up waste places for themselves;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">There the prisoners are at ease together; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For the thing which I fear cometh upon me, and that which I am afraid of cometh unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; but trouble cometh.</p>
