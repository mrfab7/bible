<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The burden of Egypt.Behold, Jehovah rideth upon a swift cloud, and cometh unto Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall tremble at his presence; and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the midst of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And I will stir up the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbor; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst of it; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek unto the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and become dry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the rivers shall become foul; the streams of Egypt shall be diminished and dried up; the reeds and flags shall wither away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The meadows by the Nile, by the brink of the Nile, and all the sown fields of the Nile, shall become dry, be driven away, and be no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the fishers shall lament, and all they that cast angle into the Nile shall mourn, and they that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Moreover they that work in combed flax, and they that weave white cloth, shall be confounded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the pillars of Egypt shall be broken in pieces; all they that work for hire shall be grieved in soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The princes of Zoan are utterly foolish; the counsel of the wisest counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Where then are thy wise men? and let them tell thee now; and let them know what Jehovah of hosts hath purposed concerning Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Memphis are deceived; they have caused Egypt to go astray, that are the corner-stone of her tribes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Jehovah hath mingled a spirit of perverseness in the midst of her; and they have caused Egypt to go astray in every work thereof, as a drunken man staggereth in his vomit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Neither shall there be for Egypt any work, which head or tail, palm-branch or rush, may do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">In that day shall the Egyptians be like unto women; and they shall tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Jehovah of hosts, which he shaketh over them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the land of Judah shall become a terror unto Egypt; every one to whom mention is made thereof shall be afraid, because of the purpose of Jehovah of hosts, which he purposeth against it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Egypt that speak the language of Canaan, and swear to Jehovah of hosts; one shall be called The city of destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">In that day shall there be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto Jehovah of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they shall cry unto Jehovah because of oppressors, and he will send them a saviour, and a defender, and he will deliver them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Jehovah shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know Jehovah in that day; yea, they shall worship with sacrifice and oblation, and shall vow a vow unto Jehovah, and shall perform it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Jehovah will smite Egypt, smiting and healing; and they shall return unto Jehovah, and he will be entreated of them, and will heal them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and the Egyptians shall worship with the Assyrians.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">for that Jehovah of hosts hath blessed them, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance.</p>
