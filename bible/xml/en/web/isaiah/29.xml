<chapter book="Isaiah" number="29" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Woe to Ariel! Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add year to year; let the feasts come around;</verse>
  <verse number="2">then I will distress Ariel, and there will be mourning and lamentation. She shall be to me as an altar hearth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I will encamp against you all around you, and will lay siege against you with posted troops. I will raise siege works against you.</verse>
  <verse number="4">You will be brought down, and will speak out of the ground. Your speech will mumble out of the dust. Your voice will be as of one who has a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and your speech will whisper out of the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But the multitude of your foes will be like fine dust, and the multitude of the ruthless ones like chaff that blows away. Yes, it will be in an instant, suddenly.</verse>
  <verse number="6">She will be visited by Yahweh of Armies with thunder, with earthquake, with great noise, with whirlwind and storm, and with the flame of a devouring fire.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all who fight against her and her stronghold, and who distress her, will be like a dream, a vision of the night.</verse>
  <verse number="8">It will be like when a hungry man dreams, and behold, he eats; but he awakes, and his hunger isn’t satisfied; or like when a thirsty man dreams, and behold, he drinks; but he awakes, and behold, he is faint, and he is still thirsty. The multitude of all the nations that fight against Mount Zion will be like that.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Pause and wonder! Blind yourselves and be blind! They are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For Yahweh has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes, the prophets; and he has covered your heads, the seers.</verse>
  <verse number="11">All vision has become to you like the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to one who is educated, saying, “Read this, please;” and he says, “I can’t, for it is sealed:”</verse>
  <verse number="12">and the book is delivered to one who is not educated, saying, “Read this, please;” and he says, “I can’t read.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">The Lord said, “Because this people draws near with their mouth and with their lips to honor me, but they have removed their heart far from me, and their fear of me is a commandment of men which has been taught;</verse>
  <verse number="14">therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder; and the wisdom of their wise men will perish, and the understanding of their prudent men will be hidden.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">Woe to those who deeply hide their counsel from Yahweh, and whose works are in the dark, and who say, “Who sees us?” and “Who knows us?”</verse>
  <verse number="16">You turn things upside down! Should the potter be thought to be like clay; that the thing made should say about him who made it, “He didn’t make me;” or the thing formed say of him who formed it, “He has no understanding?”</verse>
  <verse number="17">Isn’t it yet a very little while, and Lebanon will be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field will be regarded as a forest?</verse>
  <verse number="18">In that day, the deaf will hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind will see out of obscurity and out of darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The humble also will increase their joy in Yahweh, and the poor among men will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For the ruthless is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases, and all those who are alert to do evil are cut off—</verse>
  <verse number="21">who cause a person to be indicted by a word, and lay a snare for the arbiter in the gate, and who deprive the innocent of justice with false testimony.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Therefore thus says Yahweh, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: “Jacob shall no longer be ashamed, neither shall his face grow pale.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they will sanctify my name. Yes, they will sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and will stand in awe of the God of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="24">They also who err in spirit will come to understanding, and those who grumble will receive instruction.”</verse>
