<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Faithful the word, If any strive for superintendence, he eagerly desires a good work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Therefore an overseer must be irreprehensible, husband of one wife, sober, of sound mind, well arranged, hospitable, giving instruction;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Not intoxicated, not a quarrelsome person, not occupied in sordid gain; but equitable, without fighting, exempt from avarice;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Presiding well over his own house, having the children in subjection with all gravity;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">(And if any know not to preside over his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Not newly planted, lest rendered proud he fall into condemnation of the accuser.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he must also have good testimony from them without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the accuser.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Deacons likewise grave, not speaking equivocally, not holding to much wine, not occupied in sordid gain;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Having the mystery of faith in pure consciousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And let these also first be tried; then let them perform the office of footman, being blameless.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Wives also grave, not accusers, sober, faithful in all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let the deacons be husbands of one wife, presiding well over the children and their own houses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For they having served well, acquire to themselves a good step, and much freedom of speech in the faith which in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">These I write to thee, hoping to come to thee quickly:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And if I delay, that thou shouldest know how thou must be occupied in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And manifestly great is the mystery of devotion: God was manifested in the flesh, was justified in the Spirit, was seen by angels, was proclaimed in the nations, was believed on in the world, was received up in glory.</p>
