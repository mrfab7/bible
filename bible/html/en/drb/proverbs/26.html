<p class="verse" data-verse="1">As snow in summer, and rain in harvest, so glory is not seemly for a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As a bird flying to other places, and a sparrow going here or there: so a curse uttered without cause shall come upon a man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A whip for a horse, and a snaffle for an ass, and a rod for the back of fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou be made like him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he imagine himself to be wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He that sendeth words by a foolish messenger, is lame of feet and drinketh iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">As a lame man hath fair legs in vain: so a parable is unseemly in the mouth of fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">As he that casteth a stone into the heap of Mercury: so is he that giveth honour to a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">As if a thorn should grow in the hand of a drunkard: so is a parable in the mouth of fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Judgment determineth causes: and he that putteth a fool to silence, appeaseth anger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">As a dog that returneth to his vomit, so is the fool that repeateth his folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Hast thou seen a man wise in his own conceit? there shall be more hope of a fool than of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The slothful man saith: There is a lion in the way, and a lioness in the roads.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">As the door turneth upon its hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The slothful hideth his hand under his armpit, and it grieveth him to turn it to his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit, than seven men that speak sentences.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">As he that taketh a dog by the ears, so is he that passeth by in anger, and meddleth with another manâ€™s quarrel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">As he is guilty that shooteth arrows, and lances unto death :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">So is the man that hurteth his friend deceitfully: and when he is taken, saith: I did it in jest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">When the wood faileth, the fire shall go out: and when the talebearer is taken away, contentions shall cease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire, so an angry man stirreth up strife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The words of a talebearer are as it were simple, but they reach to the innermost parts of the belly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Swelling lips joined with a corrupt heart, are like an earthen vessel adorned with silver dross.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">An enemy is known by his lips, when in his heart he entertaineth deceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">When he shall speak low, trust him not: because there are seven mischiefs in his heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He that covereth hatred deceitfully, his malice shall be laid open in the public assembly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that rolleth a stone, it shall return to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A deceitful tongue loveth not truth: and a slippery mouth worketh ruin.</p>
