<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="1" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The parables of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">To know wisdom, and instruction: To understand the words of prudence:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and to receive the instruction of doctrine, justice, and judgment, and equity:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To give subtilty to little ones, to the young man knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A wise man shall hear and shall be wiser: and he that understandeth, shall possess governments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He shall understand a parable, and the interpretation, the words of the wise, and their mysterious sayings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Fools despise wisdom and instruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">That grace may be added to thy head, and a chain of gold to thy neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">My son, if sinners shall entice thee, consent not to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If they shall say: Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us hide snares for the innocent without cause:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let us swallow him up alive like hell, and whole as one that goeth down into the pit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoils.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Cast in thy lot with us, let us all have one purse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">My son, walk not thou with them, restrain thy foot from their paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But a net is spread in vain before the eyes of them that have wings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And they themselves lie in wait for their own blood, and practise deceits against their own souls.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">So the wage of every covetous man destroy the souls of the possessors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Wisdom preacheth abroad, she uttereth her voice in the streets:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">At the head of multitudes she crieth out, in the entrance of the gates of the city she uttereth her words, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">O children, how long will you love childishness, and fools covet those things which are hurtful to themselves, and the unwise hate knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Turn ye at my reproof: behold I will utter my spirit to you, and will shew you my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Because I called, and you refused: I stretched out my hand, and there was none that regarded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">You have despised all my counsel, and have neglected my reprehensions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I also will laugh in your destruction, and will mock when that shall come to you which you feared.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">When sudden calamity shall fall on you, and destruction, as a tempest, shall be at hand: when tribulation and distress shall come upon you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Then shall they call upon me, and I will not hear: they shall rise in the morning and shall not find me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Because they have hated instruction and received not the fear of the Lord,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Nor consented to my counsel, but despised all my reproof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way, and shall be filled with their own devices.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">The turning away of little ones shall kill them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">But he that shall hear me, shall rest without terror, and shall enjoy abundance, without fear of evils.</p>
