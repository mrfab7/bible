<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there: and make there an altar to God, that appeared to you when you fled from the face of Esau your brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Then Jacob said to his household, and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and change your garments:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with me in the way which I went.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they gave to Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And they journeyed: and the terror of God was on the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel: because there God appeared to him, when he fled from the face of his brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And God appeared to Jacob again, when he came out of Padanaram, and blessed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And God said to him, Your name is Jacob: your name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be your name: and he called his name Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And God said to him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of you, and kings shall come out of your loins;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to you I will give it, and to your seed after you will I give the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and he poured oil thereon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Bethel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And it came to pass, when she was in hard labor, that the midwife said to her, Fear not; you shall have this son also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him Benjamin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Jacob set a pillar on her grave: that is the pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And it came to pass, when Israel dwelled in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine: and Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And Jacob came to Isaac his father to Mamre, to the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered to his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.</p>
