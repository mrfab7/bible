  <verse number="1">Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity Than he that is perverse in his lips and a fool at the same time.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Also, that the soul be without knowledge is not good; And he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The foolishness of man perverteth his way; And his heart fretteth against the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Wealth addeth many friends; But as for the poor, his friend separateth himself from him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">A false witness shall not be unpunished; And he that breatheth forth lies shall not escape.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Many will entreat the favour of the liberal man; And every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.</verse>
  <verse number="7">All the brethren of the poor do hate him; How much more do his friends go far from him! He that pursueth words, they turn against him.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul; He that keepeth understanding shall find good.</verse>
  <verse number="9">A false witness shall not be unpunished; And he that breatheth forth lies shall perish.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Luxury is not seemly for a fool; Much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</verse>
  <verse number="11">It is the discretion of a man to be slow to anger, And it is his glory to pass over a transgression.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion; But his favour is as dew upon the grass.</verse>
  <verse number="13">A foolish son is the calamity of his father; And the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.</verse>
  <verse number="14">House and riches are the inheritance of fathers; But a prudent wife is from the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; And the idle soul shall suffer hunger.</verse>
  <verse number="16">He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his soul; But he that despiseth His ways shall die.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He that is gracious unto the poor lendeth unto the LORD; And his good deed will He repay unto him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Chasten thy son, for there is hope; But set not thy heart on his destruction.</verse>
  <verse number="19">A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment; For if thou interpose, thou wilt add thereto.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Hear counsel, and receive instruction, That thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.</verse>
  <verse number="21">There are many devices in a man’s heart; But the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The lust of a man is his shame; And a poor man is better than a liar.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The fear of the LORD tendeth to life; And he that hath it shall abide satisfied, He shall not be visited with evil.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish, And will not so much as bring it back to his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="25">When thou smitest a scorner, the simple will become prudent; And when one that hath understanding is reproved, he will understand knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="26">A son that dealeth shamefully and reproachfully Will despoil his father, and chase away his mother.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Cease, my son, to hear the instruction That causeth to err from the words of knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="28">An ungodly witness mocketh at right; And the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Judgments are prepared for scorners, And stripes for the back of fools.</verse>
