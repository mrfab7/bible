  <verse number="1">After that, Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says: ‘Let My people go, so that they may hold a feast to Me in the wilderness.’”</verse>
  <verse number="2">But Pharaoh replied, “Who is the LORD that I should obey His voice and let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, and I will not let Israel go.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">“The God of the Hebrews has met with us,” they answered. “Please let us go on a three-day journey into the wilderness to sacrifice to the LORD our God, or He may strike us with plagues or with the sword.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">But the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why do you draw the people away from their work? Get back to your labor!”</verse>
  <verse number="5">Pharaoh also said, “Look, the people of the land are now numerous, and you would be stopping them from their labor.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">That same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people and their foremen:</verse>
  <verse number="7">“You shall no longer supply the people with straw for making bricks. They must go and gather their own straw.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But require of them the same quota of bricks as before; do not reduce it. For they are lazy; that is why they are crying out, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’</verse>
  <verse number="9">Make the work harder on the men so they will be occupied and pay no attention to these lies.”</verse>
  <verse number="10">So the taskmasters and foremen of the people went out and said to them, “This is what Pharaoh says: ‘I am no longer giving you straw.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it; but your workload will in no way be reduced.’”</verse>
  <verse number="12">So the people scattered all over the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The taskmasters kept pressing them, saying, “Fulfill your quota each day, just as you did when straw was provided.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then the Israelite foremen, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over the people, were beaten and asked, “Why have you not fulfilled your quota of bricks yesterday or today, as you did before?”</verse>
  <verse number="15">So the Israelite foremen went and appealed to Pharaoh: “Why are you treating your servants this way?</verse>
  <verse number="16">No straw has been given to your servants, yet we are told, ‘Make bricks!’ Look, your servants are being beaten, but the fault is with your own people.”</verse>
  <verse number="17">“You are slackers!” Pharaoh replied. “Slackers! That is why you keep saying, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.’</verse>
  <verse number="18">Now get to work. You will be given no straw, yet you must deliver the full quota of bricks.”</verse>
  <verse number="19">The Israelite foremen realized they were in trouble when they were told, “You must not reduce your daily quota of bricks.”</verse>
  <verse number="20">When they left Pharaoh, they confronted Moses and Aaron, who stood waiting to meet them.</verse>
  <verse number="21">“May the LORD look upon you and judge you,” the foremen said, “for you have made us a stench before Pharaoh and his officials; you have placed in their hand a sword to kill us!”</verse>
  <verse number="22">So Moses returned to the LORD and asked, “Lord, why have You brought trouble upon this people? Is this why You sent me?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Ever since I went to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has brought trouble on this people, and You have not delivered Your people in any way.”</verse>
