<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Joseph commanded the steward of his house, saying: Fill their sacks with corn, as much as they can hold: and put the money of every one in the top of his sack.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And in the mouth of the younger’s sack put my silver cup, and the price which he gave for the wheat. And it was so done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And when the morning arose, they were sent away with their asses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And when they were now departed out of the city, and had gone forward a little way; Joseph sendingfor the steward of his house, said: Arise, and pursue after the men: and when thou hast overtaken them, say to them: Why have you returned evil for good?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The cup which you have stolen is that in which my lord drinketh, and in which he is wont to divine: you have done a very evil thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He did as he had commanded him. And having overtaken them, he spoke to them the same words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And they answered: Why doth our lord speak so, as though thy servants had committed so heinous a fact?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The money, that we found in the top of our sacks, we brought back to thee from the land of Chanaan: how then should it be that we should steal out of thy lord’s house, gold or silver?\</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">With whomsoever of thy servants shall be found that which thou seekest, let him die, and we will be the bondmen of my lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he said to them: Let it be according to your sentence: with whomsoever it shall be found, let him be my servant, and you shall be blameless.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Them they speedily took down their sacks to the ground, and every man opened his sack.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Which when he had searched, beginning at the eldest and ending at the youngest, he found the cup in Benjamin’s sack.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Then they rent their garments, and loading their asses again, returned into the town.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Juda at the head of his brethren went in to Joseph, (for he was not yet gone out of the place, ) and they altogether fell down before him on the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he said to them: Why would you do so? know you not that there is no one like me in the science of divining.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Juda said to him: What shall we answer my lord? or what shall we say, or be able justly to allege? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are all bondmen to my lord, both we, and he with whom the cup was found.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Joseph answered: God forbid that should do so: he that stole the cup, he shall be my bondman: and go you away free to your father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then Juda coming hearer, said boldly: I beseech thee, my lord, let thy servant speak a word in thy ears,and be not angry with thy servant: for after Pharao thou art,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">My lord. Thou didst ask thy servants the first time: Have you a father or a brother?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And we answered thee, my lord: We have a father an old man, and a young boy, that was born in his old age; whose brother by the mother is dead: and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him tenderly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And thou saidst to thy servants: Bring him hither to me, and I will set my eyes on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">We suggested to my lord: The boy cannot leave his father: for if he leave him, he will die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And thou saidst to thy servants: Except your youngest brother come with you, you shall see my face no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Therefore when we were gone up to thy servant our father, we told him all that my lord had said.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And our father said: Go again, and buy us a little wheat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And we said to him: We cannot go: if our youngest brother go down with us, we will set out together: otherwise, without him we dare not see the man’s face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Whereunto he answered: You know that my wife bore two.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">One went out, and you said: A beast devoured him: and hitherto he appeareth not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">If you take this also, and any thing befall him in the way you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow unto hell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">30Therefore if I shall go to thy servant our father, and the boy be wanting, (whereas his life dependeth upon the life of him,)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And he shall see that he is not with us, he will die, and thy servants shall bring down his gray hairs with sorrow unto hell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Let me be tht proper servant, who took him into my trust, and promised, saying: If I bring him not again, I will be guilty of sin against my father for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Therefore I thy servant will stay instead of the boy in the service of my lord, and let the boy go up with his brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For I cannot return to my father without the boy, lest I be a witness of the calamity that will oppress my father.</p>
