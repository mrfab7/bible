<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD has commanded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">If a man vow a vow to the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If a woman also vow a vow to the LORD, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father’s house in her youth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And her father hear her vow, and her bond with which she has bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But if her father disallow her in the day that he hears; not any of her vows, or of her bonds with which she has bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, with which she bound her soul;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds with which she bound her soul shall stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, with which she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, with which they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And if she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But if her husband has utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband has made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establishes all her vows, or all her bonds, which are on her: he confirms them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But if he shall any ways make them void after that he has heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth in her father’s house.</p>
