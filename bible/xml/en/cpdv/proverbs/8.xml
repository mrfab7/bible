<chapter book="Proverbs" number="8" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Does not wisdom call out, and prudence bestow her voice?</verse>
  <verse number="2">At the summits and the tops of exalted places, standing above the ways, in the midst of the paths,</verse>
  <verse number="3">beside the gates of the city, at the very doors, she speaks, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="4">“O men, to you I call out, and my voice is to the sons of men.</verse>
  <verse number="5">O little ones, understand discernment. And you who are unwise, turn your souls.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Listen, for I will speak about great things, and my lips will be opened, so as to foretell what is right.</verse>
  <verse number="7">My throat shall practice truth, and my lips shall detest the impious.</verse>
  <verse number="8">All my words are just. There is no depravity in them, and no perversity.</verse>
  <verse number="9">They are upright to those who understand, and equitable to those who discover knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Accept my discipline, and not money. Choose the doctrine that is greater than gold.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For wisdom is better than all that is most precious, and everything that is desirable cannot compare to her.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I, wisdom, dwell in counsel, and I am inside learned thoughts.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The fear of the Lord hates evil. I detest arrogance, and pride, and every wicked way, and a mouth with a double tongue.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Counsel is mine, and equity. Prudence is mine. Strength is mine.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Through me, kings reign and legislators decree just conditions.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Through me, princes rule and the powerful decree justice.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I love those who love me. And those who stand watch for me until morning shall discover me.</verse>
  <verse number="18">With me, are wealth and glory, superb riches and justice.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For my fruit is better than gold and precious stones, and my progeny better than choice silver.</verse>
  <verse number="20">I walk in the way of justice, in the midst of the paths of judgment,</verse>
  <verse number="21">so that I may enrich those who love me, and thus complete their treasures.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways, before he made anything, from the beginning.</verse>
  <verse number="23">I was ordained from eternity, and out of antiquity, before the earth was formed.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The abyss did not yet exist, and I was already conceived; neither had the fountains of waters yet erupted.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The mountains, with their great mass, had not yet been established. Before the hills, I was brought forth.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Still he had not made the earth, and the rivers, and the poles of the globe of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="27">I was already present: when he prepared the heavens; when, with a certain law and a circuit, he fortified the abyss;</verse>
  <verse number="28">when he made firm the sky above, and set free the fountains of waters;</verse>
  <verse number="29">when he encompassed the sea within its limits, and laid down a law for the waters, lest they transgress their limits; when he weighed the foundations of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="30">I was with him in composing all things. And I was delighted, throughout every day, by playing in his sight at all times,</verse>
  <verse number="31">playing in globe of the earth. And my delight was to be with the sons of men.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Therefore, sons, hear me now. Blessed are those who preserve my ways.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Listen to discipline, and become wise, and do not be willing to cast it aside.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Blessed is the man who listens to me, and who stands watch at my gates everyday, and who observes at the posts of my doors.</verse>
  <verse number="35">He who finds me, finds life, and he will draw salvation from the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="36">But he who sins against me will wound his own soul. All who hate me love death.”</verse>
