<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I desire therefore, first of all, that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all men:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For kings, and for all that are in high station: that we may lead a quiet and a peaceable life in all piety and chastity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who will have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For there is one God, and one mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Who gave himself a redemption for all, a testimony in due times.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Whereunto I am appointed a preacher and an apostle, (I say the truth, I lie not,) a doctor of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I will therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up pure hands, without anger and contention.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">In like manner women also in decent apparel: adorning themselves with modesty and sobriety, not with plaited hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly attire,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But as it becometh women professing godliness, with good works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Let the woman learn in silence, with all subjection.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to use authority over the man: but to be in silence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For Adam was first formed; then Eve.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Adam was not seduced; but the woman being seduced, was in the transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Yet she shall be saved through childbearing; if she continue in faith, and love, and sanctification, with sobriety.</p>
