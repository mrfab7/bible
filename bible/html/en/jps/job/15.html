<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Should a wise man make answer with windy knowledge, And fill his belly with the east wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Should he reason with unprofitable talk, Or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Yea, thou doest away with fear, And impairest devotion before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth, And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; Yea, thine own lips testify against thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Art thou the first man that was born? Or wast thou brought forth before the hills?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Dost thou hearken in the council of God? And dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What knowest thou, that we know not? What understandest thou, which is not in us?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, Much older than thy father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Are the consolations of God too small for thee, And the word that dealeth gently with thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Why doth thy heart carry thee away? And why do thine eyes wink?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">That thou turnest thy spirit against God, And lettest such words go out of thy mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What is man, that he should be clean? And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold, He putteth no trust in His holy ones; Yea, the heavens are not clean in His sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">How much less one that is abominable and impure, Man who drinketh iniquity like water!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I will tell thee, hear thou me; And that which I have seen I will declare—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Which wise men have told From their fathers, and have not hid it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Unto whom alone the land was given, And no stranger passed among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, Even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">A sound of terrors is in his ears: In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, And he is waited for of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He wandereth abroad for bread: ‘Where is it?’ He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Distress and anguish overwhelm him; They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Because he hath stretched out his hand against God, And behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He runneth upon him with a stiff neck, With the thick bosses of his bucklers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Because he hath covered his face with his fatness, And made collops of fat on his loins;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And he hath dwelt in desolate cities, In houses which no man would inhabit, Which were ready to become heaps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, Neither shall their produce bend to the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He shall not depart out of darkness; The flame shall dry up his branches, And by the breath of His mouth shall he go away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself; For vanity shall be his recompense.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">It shall be accomplished before his time, And his branch shall not be leafy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, And shall cast off his flower as the olive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For the company of the godless shall be desolate, And fire shall consume the tents of bribery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, And their belly prepareth deceit.</p>
