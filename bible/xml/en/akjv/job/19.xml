<chapter book="Job" number="19" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Then Job answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">How long will you vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?</verse>
  <verse number="3">These ten times have you reproached me: you are not ashamed that you make yourselves strange to me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And be it indeed that I have erred, my error remains with myself.</verse>
  <verse number="5">If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:</verse>
  <verse number="6">Know now that God has overthrown me, and has compassed me with his net.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He has fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he has set darkness in my paths.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He has stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He has destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and my hope has he removed like a tree.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He has also kindled his wrath against me, and he counts me to him as one of his enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="12">His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He has put my brothers far from me, and my acquaintance are truly estranged from me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.</verse>
  <verse number="15">They that dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I entreated him with my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">My breath is strange to my wife, though I entreated for the children’s sake of my own body.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Yes, young children despised me; I arose, and they spoke against me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My bone sticks to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Have pity on me, have pity on me, O you my friends; for the hand of God has touched me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Why do you persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!</verse>
  <verse number="24">That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!</verse>
  <verse number="25">For I know that my redeemer lives, and that he shall stand at the latter day on the earth:</verse>
  <verse number="26">And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:</verse>
  <verse number="27">Whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But you should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?</verse>
  <verse number="29">Be you afraid of the sword: for wrath brings the punishments of the sword, that you may know there is a judgment.</verse>
