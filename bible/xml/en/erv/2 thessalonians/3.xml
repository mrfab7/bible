  <verse number="1">Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as also it is with you;</verse>
  <verse number="2">and that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for all have not faith.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and guard you from the evil one.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which they received of us.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For yourselves know how ye ought to imitate us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;</verse>
  <verse number="8">neither did we eat bread for nought at any man’s hand, but in labour and travail, working night and day, that we might not burden any of you:</verse>
  <verse number="9">not because we have not the right, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you, that ye should imitate us.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, If any will not work, neither let him eat.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For we hear of some that walk among you disorderly, that work not at all, but are busybodies.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now them that are such we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But ye, brethren, be not weary in well-doing.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And if any man obeyeth not our word by this epistle, note that man, that ye have no company with him, to the end that he may be ashamed.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in all ways. The Lord be with you all.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.</verse>
