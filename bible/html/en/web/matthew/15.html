<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat bread.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He answered them, “Why do you also disobey the commandment of God because of your tradition?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For God commanded, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But you say, ‘Whoever may tell his father or his mother, “Whatever help you might otherwise have gotten from me is a gift devoted to God,”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">he shall not honor his father or mother.’ You have made the commandment of God void because of your tradition.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">‘These people draw near to me with their mouth, and honor me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrine rules made by men.’”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He summoned the multitude, and said to them, “Hear, and understand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">That which enters into the mouth doesn’t defile the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Then the disciples came, and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But he answered, “Every plant which my heavenly Father didn’t plant will be uprooted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If the blind guide the blind, both will fall into a pit.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Peter answered him, “Explain the parable to us.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">So Jesus said, “Do you also still not understand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the belly, and then out of the body?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and they defile the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual sins, thefts, false testimony, and blasphemies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">These are the things which defile the man; but to eat with unwashed hands doesn’t defile the man.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Jesus went out from there, and withdrew into the region of Tyre and Sidon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, you son of David! My daughter is severely demonized!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But he answered her not a word. His disciples came and begged him, saying, “Send her away; for she cries after us.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But he answered, “I wasn’t sent to anyone but the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But she came and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, help me.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But he answered, “It is not appropriate to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">But she said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Then Jesus answered her, “Woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you even as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that hour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Jesus departed there, and came near to the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Great multitudes came to him, having with them the lame, blind, mute, maimed, and many others, and they put them down at his feet. He healed them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">so that the multitude wondered when they saw the mute speaking, injured whole, lame walking, and blind seeing—and they glorified the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Jesus summoned his disciples and said, “I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away fasting, or they might faint on the way.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The disciples said to him, “Where should we get so many loaves in a deserted place as to satisfy so great a multitude?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Jesus said to them, “How many loaves do you have?” They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">and he took the seven loaves and the fish. He gave thanks and broke them, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">They all ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces that were left over.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Then he sent away the multitudes, got into the boat, and came into the borders of Magdala.</p>
