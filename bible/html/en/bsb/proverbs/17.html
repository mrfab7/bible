<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Better a dry morsel in quietness than a house full of feasting with strife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A wise servant will rule over a disgraceful son and share his inheritance as one of the brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A crucible for silver and a furnace for gold, but the LORD is the tester of hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A wicked man listens to evil lips; a liar gives ear to a destructive tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He who mocks the poor insults their Maker; whoever gloats over calamity will not go unpunished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Grandchildren are the crown of the aged, and the glory of a son is his father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Eloquent words are unfit for a fool; how much worse are lying lips to a ruler!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">A bribe is a charm to its giver; wherever he turns, he succeeds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Whoever conceals an offense promotes love, but he who brings it up separates friends.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A rebuke cuts into a man of discernment deeper than a hundred lashes cut into a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">An evil man seeks only rebellion; a cruel messenger will be sent against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">It is better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs than a fool in his folly.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="14">To start a quarrel is to release a flood; so abandon the dispute before it breaks out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Acquitting the guilty and condemning the righteousâ€”both are detestable to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Why should the fool have money in his hand with no intention of buying wisdom?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">A man lacking judgment strikes hands in pledge and puts up security for his neighbor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He who loves transgression loves strife; he who builds his gate high invites destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The one with a perverse heart finds no good, and he whose tongue is deceitful falls into trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">A man fathers a fool to his own grief; the father of a fool has no joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A joyful heart is good medicine, but a broken spirit dries up the bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">A wicked man takes a covert bribe to subvert the course of justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Wisdom is the focus of the discerning, but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">A foolish son brings grief to his father and bitterness to her who bore him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">It is surely not good to punish the innocent or to flog a noble for his honesty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">A man of knowledge restrains his words, and a man of understanding maintains a calm spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Even a fool is considered wise if he keeps silent, and discerning when he holds his tongue.</p>
