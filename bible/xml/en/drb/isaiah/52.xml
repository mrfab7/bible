  <verse number="6">Therefore my people shall know my name in that day: for I myself that spoke, behold I am here.</verse>
  <verse number="7">How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, and that preacheth peace: of him that sheweth forth good, that preacheth salvation, that saith to Sion: Thy God shall reign!</verse>

  <verse number="13">Behold my servant shall understand, he shall be exalted, and extolled, and shall be exceeding high.</verse>
  <verse number="14">As many have been astonished at thee, so shall his visage be inglorious among men, and his form among the sons of men.</verse>
  <verse number="15">He shall sprinkle many nations, kings shall shut their mouth at him: for they to whom it was not told of him, have seen: and they that heard not, have beheld.</verse>
