<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="9" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">AT the first time the land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephtali was lightly touched: and at the last the way of the sea beyond the Jordan of the Galilee of the Gentiles was heavily loaded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The people that walked in darkness, have seen a great light: to them that dwelt in the region of the shadow of death, light is risen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thou hast multiplied the nation, and hast not increased the joy. They shall rejoice before thee, as they that rejoice in the harvest, as conquerors rejoice after taking a prey, when they divide the spoils.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For the yoke of their burden, and the rod of their shoulder, and the sceptre of their oppressor thou best overcome, as in the day of Median.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For every violent taking of spoils, with tumult, and garment mingled with blood, shall be burnt, and be fuel for the fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For a CHILD IS BORN to us, and a son is given to us, and the government is upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called, Wonderful, Counsellor, God the Mighty, the Father of the world to come, the Prince of Peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">His empire shall be multiplied, and there shall be no end of peace: he shall sit upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom; to establish it and strengthen it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth and for ever: the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And all the people of Ephraim shall know, and the inhabitants of Samaria that say in the pride and haughtiness of their heart:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with square stones: they have cut down the sycamores, but we will change them for cedars.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the Lord shall set up the enemies of Rasin over him, and shall bring on his enemies in a crowd:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The Syrians from the east, and the Philistines from the west: and they shall devour Israel with open mouth, For all this his indignation is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the people are not returned to him who hath struck them, and have not sought after the Lord of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And the Lord shall destroy out of Israel the head and the tail, him that bendeth down, and him that holdeth back, in one day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The aged and honourable, he is the head: and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And they that call this people blessed, shall cause them to err: and they that are called blessed, shall be thrown down headlong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Therefore the Lord shell have no joy in their young men: neither shall he have mercy on their fatherless, and widows: for every one is a hypocrite and wicked, and every mouth hath spoken folly. For all this his indignation is not turned away, but his bend is stretched out still.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For wickedness is kindled as a fire, it shall devour the brier and the thorn: and shall kindle in the thicket of the forest, and it shall be wrapped up in smoke ascending on high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">By the wrath of the Lord of hosts the land is troubled, and the people shall be as fuel for the fire: no man shall spare his brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And he shall turn to the right hand, and shall be hungry: and shall eat on the left hand, and shall not be filled: every one shell eat the flesh of his own arm: Manasses Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasses, and they together shall be against Juda.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">After all these things his indignation is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</p>
