<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight is his delight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">When pride comes, then comes shame: but with the lowly is wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivers from death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When a wicked man dies, his expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust men perishes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked comes in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">An hypocrite with his mouth destroys his neighbor: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He that is void of wisdom despises his neighbor: but a man of understanding holds his peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A talebearer reveals secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit conceals the matter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that hates indebtedness is sure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A gracious woman retains honor: and strong men retain riches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The merciful man does good to his own soul: but he that is cruel troubles his own flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The wicked works a deceitful work: but to him that sows righteousness shall be a sure reward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">As righteousness tends to life: so he that pursues evil pursues it to his own death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">They that are of a fraudulent heart are abomination to the LORD: but such as are upright in their way are his delight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">As a jewel of gold in a swineâ€™s snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">There is that scatters, and yet increases; and there is that withholds more than is meet, but it tends to poverty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that waters shall be watered also himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He that withholds corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing shall be on the head of him that sells it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He that diligently seeks good procures favor: but he that seeks mischief, it shall come to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He that trusts in his riches shall fall; but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He that troubles his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that wins souls is wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.</p>
