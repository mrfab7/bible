<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he said to Aaron, Take you a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And to the children of Israel you shall speak, saying, Take you a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded that you should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And Moses said to Aaron, Go to the altar, and offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make an atonement for yourself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Aaron therefore went to the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But the fat, and the kidneys, and the lobe above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt on the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled round about on the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And they presented the burnt offering to him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them on the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them on the burnt offering on the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the manner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt it on the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron’s sons presented to him the blood, which he sprinkled on the altar round about,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covers the inwards, and the kidneys, and the lobe above the liver:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And they put the fat on the breasts, and he burnt the fat on the altar:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed on the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</p>
