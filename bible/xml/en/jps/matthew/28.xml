  <verse number="1">After the Sabbath, in the early dawn of the first day of the week, Mary of Magdala and the other Mary came to see the sepulchre.</verse>
  <verse number="2">But to their amazement there had been a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord had descended from Heaven, and had come and rolled back the stone, and was sitting upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="3">His appearance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For fear of him the guards trembled violently, and became like dead men.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But the angel said to the women, “As for you, dismiss your fears. I know that it is Jesus that you are looking for—the crucified One.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He is not here: He has come back to life, as He foretold. Come and see the place where He lay.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead and is going before you into Galilee: there you shall see Him. Remember, I have told you.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">They quickly left the tomb and ran, still terrified but full of unspeakable joy, to carry the news to His disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And then suddenly they saw Jesus coming to meet them. “Peace be to you,” He said. And they came and clasped His feet, bowing to the ground before Him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then He said, “Dismiss all fear! Go and take word to my brethren to go into Galilee, and there they shall see me.”</verse>
  <verse number="11">While they went on this errand, some of the guards came into the city and reported to the High Priests every detail of what had happened.</verse>
  <verse number="12">So the latter held a conference with the Elders, and after consultation with them they heavily bribed the soldiers,</verse>
  <verse number="13">telling them to say, “His disciples came during the night and stole his body while we were asleep.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">“And if this,” they added, “is reported to the Governor, we will satisfy him and screen you from punishment.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this story was noised about among the Jews, and is current to this day.</verse>
  <verse number="16">As for the eleven disciples, they proceeded into Galilee, to the hill where Jesus had arranged to meet them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">There they saw Him and prostrated themselves before Him. Yet some doubted.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Jesus however came near and said to them, “All power in Heaven and over the earth has been given to me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations; baptize them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="20">and teach them to obey every command which I have given you. And remember, I am with you always, day by day, until the Close of the Age.”</verse>
