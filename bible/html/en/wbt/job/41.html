<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Canst thou put a hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Will he make many supplications to thee? will he speak soft words to thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Lay thy hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">None is so fierce that he dare rouse him: who then is able to stand before me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Who hath first benefited me, that I should repay him? whatever is under the whole heaven is mine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible around.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">His scales are his pride, shut together as with a close seal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">His sneezings flash light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire dart forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Out of his nostrils issueth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His breath kindleth coals, and a flame issueth from his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">His heart is as firm as a stone; yes, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">When he raiseth himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The sword of him that attacketh him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The arrow cannot make him flee: sling-stones are turned with him into stubble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.</p>
