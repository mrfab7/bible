  <verse number="1">Let there be a trumpet in thy throat like an eagle upon the house of the Lord: because they have transgressed my covenant, and have violated my law.</verse>
  <verse number="2">They shall call upon me: O my God, we, Israel, know thee.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Israel hath cast off the thing that is good, the enemy shall pursue him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">They have reigned, but not by me: they have been princes, and I knew not: of their silver, and their gold they have made idols to themselves, that they might perish.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thy calf, O Samaria, is cast off, my wrath is kindled against them. How long will they be incapable of being cleansed ?</verse>
  <verse number="6">For itself also is the invention of Israel: a workman made it, and it is no god: for the calf of Samaria shall be turned to spiders’ webs.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For they shall sow wind, and reap a whirlwind, there is no standing stalk in it, the bud shall yield no meal; end if it should yield, strangers shall eat it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Israel is swallowed up: now is he become among the nations like an unclean vessel.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath given gifts to his lovers.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But even though they shall have hired the nations, now will I gather them together: and they shall rest a while from the burden of the king, and the princes.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin: altars are become to him unto sin.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I shall write to him my manifold laws, which have been accounted as foreign.</verse>
  <verse number="13">They shall offer victims, they shall sacrifice flesh, and shall eat it, and the Lord will not receive them: now will he remember their iniquity, and will visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and hath built temples: and Juda hath built many fenced cities: and I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the houses thereof.</verse>
