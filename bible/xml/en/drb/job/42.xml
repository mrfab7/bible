  <verse number="1">Then Job answered the Lord, and said :</verse>
  <verse number="2">I know that thou canst do all things, and no thought is hid from thee.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore I have spoken unwisely, and things that above measure exceeded my knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Hear, and I will speak : I will ask thee, and do thou tell me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">With the hearing of the ear, I have heard thee, but now my eye seeth thee.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Therefore I reprehend myself, and do penance in dust and ashes.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And after the Lord had spoken these words to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Themanite : My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends, because you have not spoken the thing that is right before my, as my servant Job hath.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Take unto you therefore seven oxen, and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer for yourselves a holocaust : and my servant Job shall pray for you : his face I will accept, that folly be not imputed to you : for you have not spoken right things before me, as my servant Job hath.</verse>

  <verse number="11">And all his brethren came to him, and all his sisters, and all that knew him before, and they ate bread with him in his house : and bemoaned him, and comforted him upon all the evil that God had brought upon him. And every man gave him one ewe, and one earring of fold.</verse>

  <verse number="13">And he had seven sons, and three daughters.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he called the names of one Dies, and the name of the second Cassia, and the name of the third Cornustibil.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And there were not found in all the earth women so beautiful as the daughters of Job : and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Job lived after these things, a hundred and forty years, and he saw his children, and his children’s children, unto the fourth generation,</verse>
