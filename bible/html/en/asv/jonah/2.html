<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Jonah prayed unto Jehovah his God out of the fishâ€™s belly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he said, I called by reason of mine affliction unto Jehovah, And he answered me; Out of the belly of Sheol cried I, And thou heardest my voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For thou didst cast me into the depth, in the heart of the seas, And the flood was round about me; All thy waves and thy billows passed over me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I said, I am cast out from before thine eyes; Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; The deep was round about me; The weeds were wrapped about my head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; The earth with its bars closed upon me for ever: Yet hast thou brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah my God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah; And my prayer came in unto thee, into thy holy temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They that regard lying vanities Forsake their own mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Jehovah spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.</p>
