  <verse number="1">Bride: On my bed, throughout the night, I sought him whom my soul loves. I sought him, and did not find him.</verse>

  <verse number="3">The watchers who guard the city found me: “Have you seen him whom my soul loves?”</verse>
  <verse number="4">When I had passed by them a little, I found him whom my soul loves. I held him, and would not release him, until I would bring him into my mother’s house, and into the chamber of her who bore me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Groom to Chorus: I bind you by oath, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the does and the stags of the open field, not to disturb or awaken the beloved, until she wills.</verse>

  <verse number="9">Bride to Chorus: King Solomon made himself a portable throne from the wood of Lebanon.</verse>

  <verse number="11">O daughters of Zion, go forth and see king Solomon with the diadem with which his mother crowned him, on the day of his espousal, on the day of the rejoicing of his heart.</verse>
