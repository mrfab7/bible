<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The words of king Lamuel. The vision wherewith his mother instructed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">What, O my beloved, what, O the beloved of my womb, what, O the beloved of my vows?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Give not thy substance to women, and thy riches to destroy kings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Give not to kings, O Lamuel, give not wine to kings: because there is no secret where drunkenness reigneth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And lest they drink and forget judgments, and pervert the cause of the children of the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Give strong drink to them that are sad: and wine to them that are grieved in mind:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Let them drink, and forget their want, and remember their sorrow no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Open thy mouth for the dumb, and for the causes of all the children that pass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Open thy mouth, decree that which is just, and do justice to the needy and poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who shall find a valiant woman? far and from the uttermost coasts is the price of her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The heart of her husband trusteth in her, and he shall have no need of spoils.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">She will render him good, and not evil, all the days of her life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">She hath sought wool and flax, and hath wrought by the counsel of her hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">She is like the merchantâ€™s ship, she bringeth her bread from afar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And she hath risen in the night, and given a prey to her household, and victuals to her maidens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">She hath considered a field, and bought it: with the fruit of her hands she hath planted a vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">She hath girded her loins with strength, and hath strengthened her arm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">She hath tasted and seen that her traffic is good: her lamp shall not be put out in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">She hath put out her hand to strong things, and her fingers have taken hold of the spindle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">She hath opened her hand to the needy, and stretched out her hands to the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">She shall not fear for her house in the cold of snow: for dl her domestics are clothed with double garments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">She hath made for herself clothing of tapestry: fine linen, and purple is her covering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Her husband is honourable in the gates, when he sitteth among the senators of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">She made fine linen, and sold it, end delivered a girdle to the Chanaanite.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Strength and beauty are her clothing, and she shall laugh in the latter day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">She hath opened her mouth to wisdom, and the law of clemency is on her tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">She hath looked well to the paths of her house, and hath not eaten her bread idle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Her children rose up, and called her blessed: her husband, and he praised her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Many daughters have gathered together riches: thou hast surpassed them all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: the woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Give her of the fruit of her hands: and let her works praise her in the gates.</p>
