<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And as he passed on, he saw a man blind from birth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this [man] or his parents, that he should be born blind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Jesus answered, Neither has this [man] sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God should be manifested in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I must work the works of him that has sent me while it is day. [The] night is coming, when no one can work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">As long as I am in the world, I am [the] light of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Having said these things, he spat on the ground and made mud of the spittle, and put the mud, as ointment, on his eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, which is interpreted, Sent. He went therefore and washed, and came seeing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The neighbours therefore, and those who used to see him before, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that was sitting and begging?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Some said, It is he; others said, No, but he is like him: he said, It is I.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They said therefore to him, How have thine eyes been opened?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He answered [and said], A man called Jesus made mud and anointed mine eyes, and said to me, Go to Siloam and wash: and having gone and washed, I saw.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They said therefore to him, Where is he? He says, I do not know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They bring him who was before blind to the Pharisees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Now it was sabbath when Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The Pharisees therefore also again asked him how he received his sight. And he said to them, He put mud upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Some of the Pharisees therefore said, This man is not of God, for he does not keep the sabbath. Others said, How can a sinful man perform such signs? And there was a division among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">They say therefore again to the blind [man], What dost thou say of him, that he has opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him that he was blind and had received sight, until they had called the parents of him that had received sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And they asked them saying, This is your son, of whom ye say that he was born blind: how then does he now see?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">His parents answered [them] and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">but how he now sees we do not know, or who has opened his eyes we do not know. He is of age: ask him; he will speak concerning himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">His parents said these things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if any one confessed him [to be the] Christ, he should be excommunicated from the synagogue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">On this account his parents said, He is of age: ask him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">They called therefore a second time the man who had been blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is sinful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He answered therefore, If he is sinful I know not. One thing I know, that, being blind [before], now I see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And they said to him again, What did he do to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He answered them, I told you already and ye did not hear: why do ye desire to hear again? do ye also wish to become his disciples?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">They railed at him, and said, Thou art his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">We know that God spoke to Moses; but [as to] this [man], we know not whence he is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The man answered and said to them, Now in this is a wonderful thing, that ye do not know whence he is, and he has opened mine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">[But] we know that God does not hear sinners; but if any one be God-fearing and do his will, him he hears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Since time was, it has not been heard that any one opened the eyes of one born blind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If this [man] were not of God he would be able to do nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">They answered and said to him, Thou hast been wholly born in sins, and thou teachest us? And they cast him out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having found him, he said to him, Thou, dost thou believe on the Son of God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And Jesus said to him, Thou hast both seen him, and he that speaks with thee is he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And he said, I believe, Lord: and he did him homage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And Jesus said, For judgment am I come into this world, that they which see not may see, and they which see may become blind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And [some] of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and they said to him, Are we blind also?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Jesus said to them, If ye were blind ye would not have sin; but now ye say, We see, your sin remains.</p>
