<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="31" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I MADE a covenant with mine eyes; how then should I look upon a maid?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For what is the portion of God from above, and the heritage of the Almighty from on high?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, and disaster to the workers of iniquity?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Doth not he see my ways, and number all my steps?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If I have walked with vanity, and my foot hath hasted to deceit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">(Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any spot hath cleaved to mine hands:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">If mine heart have been enticed unto a woman, and I have laid wait at my neighbour’s door:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For that were an heinous crime; yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For it is a fire that consumeth unto Destruction, and would root out all mine increase.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">(Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, and I have been her guide from my mother’s womb;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or that the needy had no covering;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For calamity from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his excellency I could do nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">If I have made gold my hope, and have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And my heart hath been secretly enticed, and my mouth hath kissed my hand:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges: for I should have lied to God that is above.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">(Yea, I suffered not my mouth to sin by asking his life with a curse;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">If the men of my tent said not, Who can find one that hath not been satisfied with his flesh?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">The stranger did not lodge in the street; but I opened my doors to the traveller;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If like Adam I covered my transgressions, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Because I feared the great multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and went not out of the door—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Oh that I had one to hear me! (lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me;) and that I had the indictment which mine adversary hath written!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder; I would bind it unto me as a crown.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">If my land cry out against me, and the furrows thereof weep together;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.</p>
