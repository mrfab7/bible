  <verse number="1">Now these are the nations which Yahweh left, to prove Israel by them, even as many as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</verse>
  <verse number="2">only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing of it:</verse>
  <verse number="3">the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.</verse>
  <verse number="4">They were left to test Israel by them, to know whether they would listen to the commandments of Yahweh, which he commanded their fathers by Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The children of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites:</verse>
  <verse number="6">and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, and forgot Yahweh their God, and served the Baals and the Asheroth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years.</verse>
  <verse number="9">When the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised up a savior to the children of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The Spirit of Yahweh came on him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war, and Yahweh delivered Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand: and his hand prevailed against Cushan Rishathaim.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The land had rest forty years. Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh: and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek; and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised them up a savior, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a man left-handed. The children of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length; and he wore it under his clothing on his right thigh.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab: now Eglon was a very fat man.</verse>
  <verse number="18">When he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the people who bore the tribute.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, “I have a secret errand to you, king.” The king said, “Keep silence!” All who stood by him went out from him.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. Ehud said, “I have a message from God to you.” He arose out of his seat.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body:</verse>
  <verse number="22">and the handle also went in after the blade; and the fat closed on the blade, for he didn’t draw the sword out of his body; and it came out behind.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room on him, and locked them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw, and behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said, “Surely he is covering his feet in the upper room.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">They waited until they were ashamed; and behold, he didn’t open the doors of the upper room: therefore they took the key, and opened them, and behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Ehud escaped while they waited, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirah.</verse>
  <verse number="27">It happened, when he had come, that he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he before them.</verse>
  <verse number="28">He said to them, “Follow me; for Yahweh has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.” They followed him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and didn’t allow any man to pass over.</verse>
  <verse number="29">They struck of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped not a man.</verse>
  <verse number="30">So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. The land had rest eighty years.</verse>
  <verse number="31">After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck of the Philistines six hundred men with an oxgoad: and he also saved Israel.</verse>
