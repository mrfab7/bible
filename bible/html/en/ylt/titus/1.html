<div class="chapter" data-book="Titus" data-chapter="1" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the choice ones of God, and an acknowledging of truth that is according to piety,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">upon hope of life age-during, which God, who doth not lie, did promise before times of ages,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">(and He manifested in proper times His word,) in preaching, which I was entrusted with, according to a charge of God our Saviour,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">to Titus—true child according to a common faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For this cause left I thee in Crete, that the things lacking thou mayest arrange, and mayest set down in every city elders, as I did appoint to thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">if any one is blameless, of one wife a husband, having children stedfast, not under accusation of riotous living or insubordinate—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">for it behoveth the overseer to be blameless, as God’s steward, not self-pleased, nor irascible, not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">but a lover of strangers, a lover of good men, sober-minded, righteous, kind, self-controlled,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">holding—according to the teaching—to the stedfast word, that he may be able also to exhort in the sound teaching, and the gainsayers to convict;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">for there are many both insubordinate, vain-talkers, and mind-deceivers—especially they of the circumcision—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">whose mouth it behoveth to stop, who whole households do overturn, teaching what things it behoveth not, for filthy lucre’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A certain one of them, a prophet of their own, said—‘Cretans! always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies!’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">this testimony is true; for which cause convict them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">not giving heed to Jewish fables and commands of men, turning themselves away from the truth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">all things, indeed, are pure to the pure, and to the defiled and unstedfast is nothing pure, but of them defiled are even the mind and the conscience;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">God they profess to know, and in the works they deny Him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work disapproved.</p>
