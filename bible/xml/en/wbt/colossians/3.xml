  <verse number="1">If ye then be raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then will ye also appear with him in glory.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; lewdness, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:</verse>
  <verse number="6">For which things the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:</verse>
  <verse number="7">In which ye also walked formerly, when ye lived with them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Lie not one to another, seeing ye have put off the old man with his deeds;</verse>
  <verse number="10">And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:</verse>
  <verse number="11">Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;</verse>
  <verse number="13">Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man hath a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And whatever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well-pleasing to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:</verse>
  <verse number="23">And whatever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not to men;</verse>
  <verse number="24">Knowing that from the Lord ye will receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But he that doeth wrong, will receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.</verse>
