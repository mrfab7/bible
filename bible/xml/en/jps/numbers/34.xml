  <verse number="1">And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Command the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye come into the land of Canaan, this shall be the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to the borders thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thus your south side shall be from the wilderness of Zin close by the side of Edom, and your south border shall begin at the end of the Salt Sea eastward;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin; and the goings out thereof shall be southward of Kadesh-barnea; and it shall go forth to Hazar-addar, and pass along to Azmon;</verse>
  <verse number="5">and the border shall turn about from Azmon unto the Brook of Egypt, and the goings out thereof shall be at the Sea.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And for the western border, ye shall have the Great Sea for a border; this shall be your west border.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And this shall be your north border: from the Great Sea ye shall mark out your line unto mount Hor;</verse>
  <verse number="8">from mount Hor ye shall mark out a line unto the entrance to Hamath; and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad;</verse>
  <verse number="9">and the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out thereof shall be at Hazar-enan; this shall be your north border.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And ye shall mark out your line for the east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham;</verse>
  <verse number="11">and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down, and shall strike upon the slope of the sea of Chinnereth eastward;</verse>
  <verse number="12">and the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the goings out thereof shall be at the Salt Sea; this shall be your land according to the borders thereof round about.’</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying: ‘This is the land wherein ye shall receive inheritance by lot, which the LORD hath commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe;</verse>

  <verse number="17">These are the names of the men that shall take possession of the land for you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to take possession of the land.</verse>
