  <verse number="1">Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Esau took wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and Basemath, the daughter of Ishmael, sister of Nebaioth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then Adah bore Eliphaz. Basemath conceived Reuel.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Oholibamah conceived Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then Esau took his wives, and sons, and daughters, and every soul of his house, and his substance, and cattle, and whatever he was able to obtain in the land of Canaan, and he went into another region, withdrawing from his brother Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For they were very wealthy and were not able to live together. Neither was the land of their sojourn able to sustain them, because of the multitude of their flocks.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Esau lived at mount Seir: he is Edom.</verse>
  <verse number="9">So these are the generations of Esau, the father of Edom, at mount Seir,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and these are the names of his sons: Eliphaz the son of Adah, the wife of Esau, likewise Reuel, the son of Basemath, his wife.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Eliphaz had sons: Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenez.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now Timna was the concubine of Eliphaz, the son of Esau. And she bore him Amalek. These are the sons of Adah, the wife of Esau.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the sons of Reuel were Nahath and Zerah, Shammah and Mizzah. These are the sons of Basemath, the wife of Esau.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Likewise, these were the sons of Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, the wife of Esau, whom she bore to him: Jeush, and Jalam, and Korah.</verse>
  <verse number="15">These were leaders of the sons of Esau, the sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn of Esau: leader Teman, leader Omar, leader Zepho, leader Kenez,</verse>
  <verse number="16">leader Korah, leader Gatam, leader Amalek. These are the sons of Eliphaz, in the land of Edom, and these the sons of Adah.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Likewise, these are the sons of Reuel, the son of Esau: leader Nahath, leader Zerah, leader Shammah, leader Mizzah. And these were the leaders of Reuel, in the land of Edom. These are the sons of Basemath, the wife of Esau.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Now these are the sons of Oholibamah, the wife of Esau: leader Jeush, leader Jalam, leader Korah. These were the leaders of Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah and the wife of Esau.</verse>
  <verse number="19">These are the sons of Esau, and these were their leaders: this is Edom.</verse>
  <verse number="20">These are the sons of Seir, the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,</verse>
  <verse number="21">and Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan. These were the leaders of the Horites, the sons of Seir, in the land of Edom.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Now Lotan produced sons: Hori and Heman. But the sister of Lotan was Timna.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And these are the sons of Shobal: Alvan, and Manahath, and Ebal, and Shepho, and Onam.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And these are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is the Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness, when he was pasturing the donkeys of his father Zibeon.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he had a son Dishon, and a daughter Oholibamah.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And these are the sons of Dishon: Hemdan, and Esheban, and Ithran, and Cheran.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Likewise, these are the sons of Ezer: Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then Dishan had sons: Uz and Aran.</verse>
  <verse number="29">These were the leaders of the Horites: leader Lotan, leader Shobal, leader Zibeon, leader Anah,</verse>
  <verse number="30">leader Dishon, leader Ezer, leader Disan. These were leaders of the Horites who ruled in the land of Seir.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Now before the sons of Israel had a king, the kings who ruled in the land of Edom were these:</verse>
  <verse number="32">Bela the son of Beor, and the name of his city was Dinhabah.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Then Bela died, and Jobab, the son of Zerah from Bozrah, reigned in his place.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And when Jobab was dead, Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned in his place.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Likewise, this one having died, Hadad the son of Bedad reigned in his place. He struck down Midian in the region of Moab. And the name of his city was Avith.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And when Adad was dead, Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his place.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Likewise, this one being dead, Shaul of the river Rehoboth, reigned in his place.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And when he also had passed away, Baal-hanan, the son of Achbor, succeeded to the kingdom.</verse>
  <verse number="39">Likewise, this one being dead, Hadar reigned in his place; and the name of his city was Pau. And his wife was called Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, daughter of Mezahab.</verse>
  <verse number="40">Therefore, these were the names of the leaders of Esau, by their families, and places, and in their vocabulary: leader Timna, leader Alvah, leader Jetheth,</verse>
  <verse number="41">leader Oholibamah, leader Elah, leader Pinon,</verse>
  <verse number="42">leader Kanez, leader Teman, leader Mibzar,</verse>
  <verse number="43">leader Magdiel, leader Iram. These were the leaders of Edom living in the land of their rule: this is Esau, the father of Idumea.</verse>
