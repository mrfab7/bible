<div class="chapter" data-book="Hosea" data-chapter="4" data-translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" data-translation-id="jps" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel! For the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, Because there is no truth, nor mercy, Nor knowledge of God in the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Swearing and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery! They break all bounds, and blood toucheth blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Therefore doth the land mourn, And every one that dwelleth therein doth languish, With the beasts of the field, and the fowls of heaven; Yea, the fishes of the sea also are taken away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; For thy people are as they that strive with the priest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Therefore shalt thou stumble in the day, And the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night; And I will destroy thy mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge; Because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to Me; Seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The more they were increased, the more they sinned against Me; I will change their glory into shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They feed on the sin of My people, And set their heart on their iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And it is like people, like priest; And I will punish him for his ways, And will recompense him his doings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And they shall eat, and not have enough, They shall commit harlotry, and shall not increase; Because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Harlotry, wine, and new wine take away the heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">My people ask counsel at their stock, And their staff declareth unto them; For the spirit of harlotry hath caused them to err, And they have gone astray from under their God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, And offer upon the hills, Under oaks and poplars and terebinths, Because the shadow thereof is good; Therefore your daughters commit harlotry, And your daughters-in-law commit adultery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I will not punish your daughters when they commit harlotry, Nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery; For they themselves consort with lewd women, And they sacrifice with harlots; And the people that is without understanding is distraught.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, Yet let not Judah become guilty; And come not ye unto Gilgal, Neither go ye up to Beth-aven, Nor swear: ‘As the LORD liveth.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For Israel is stubborn like a stubborn heifer; Now shall the LORD feed them as a lamb in a large place?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Ephraim is joined to idols; Let him alone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">When their carouse is over, They take to harlotry; Her rulers deeply love dishonour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The wind hath bound her up in her skirts; And they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.</p>
