<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="28" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The wicked have fled and there is no pursuer. And the righteous as a young lion is confident.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">By the transgression of a land many are its heads. And by an intelligent man, Who knoweth right—it is prolonged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A man—poor and oppressing the weak, Is a sweeping rain, and there is no bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Those forsaking the law praise the wicked, Those keeping the law plead against them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Evil men understand not judgment, And those seeking Jehovah understand all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Better is the poor walking in his integrity, Than the perverse of ways who is rich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Whoso is keeping the law is an intelligent son, And a friend of gluttons, Doth cause his father to blush.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Whoso is multiplying his wealth by biting and usury, For one favouring the poor doth gather it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Whoso is turning his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer is an abomination.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Whoso is causing the upright to err in an evil way, Into his own pit he doth fall, And the perfect do inherit good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">A rich man is wise in his own eyes, And the intelligent poor searcheth him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">In the exulting of the righteous the glory is abundant, And in the rising of the wicked man is apprehensive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whoso is covering his transgressions prospereth not, And he who is confessing and forsaking hath mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">O the happiness of a man fearing continually, And whoso is hardening his heart falleth into evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">A growling lion, and a ranging bear, Is the wicked ruler over a poor people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A leader lacking understanding multiplieth oppressions, Whoso is hating dishonest gain prolongeth days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A man oppressed with the blood of a soul, Unto the pit fleeth, none taketh hold on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Whoso is walking uprightly is saved, And the perverted of ways falleth at once.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Whoso is tilling his ground is satisfied with bread, And whoso is pursuing vanity, Is filled with poverty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A stedfast man hath multiplied blessings, And whoso is hasting to be rich is not acquitted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">To discern faces is not good, And for a piece of bread doth a man transgress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Troubled for wealth is the man with an evil eye, And he knoweth not that want doth meet him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Whoso is reproving a man afterwards findeth grace, More than a flatterer with the tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Whoso is robbing his father, or his mother, And is saying, ‘It is not transgression,’ A companion he is to a destroyer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Whoso is proud in soul stirreth up contention, And whoso is trusting on Jehovah is made fat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Whoso is trusting in his heart is a fool, And whoso is walking in wisdom is delivered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Whoso is giving to the poor hath no lack, And whoso is hiding his eyes multiplied curses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">In the rising of the wicked a man is hidden, And in their destruction the righteous multiply!</p>
