  <verse number="1">At length, on the day of the Harvest Festival, they had all met in one place;</verse>
  <verse number="2">when suddenly there came from the sky a sound as of a strong rushing blast of wind. This filled the whole house where they were sitting;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and they saw tongues of what looked like fire distributing themselves over the assembly, and on the head of each person a tongue alighted.</verse>
  <verse number="4">They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in foreign languages according as the Spirit gave them words to utter.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now there were Jews residing in Jerusalem, devout men from every part of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="6">So when this noise was heard, they came crowding together, and were amazed because everyone heard his own language spoken.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They were beside themselves with wonder, and exclaimed, “Are not all these speakers Galilaeans?</verse>
  <verse number="8">How then does each of us hear his own native language spoken by them?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Some of us are Parthians, Medes, Elamites. Some are inhabitants of Mesopotamia, of Judaea or Cappadocia, of Pontus or the Asian Province, of Phrygia or Pamphylia,</verse>
  <verse number="10">of Egypt or of the parts of Africa towards Cyrene. Others are visitors from Rome—being either Jews or converts from heathenism—and others are Cretans or Arabians.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Yet we all alike hear these Galilaeans speaking in our own language about the wonderful things which God has done.”</verse>
  <verse number="12">They were all astounded and bewildered, and asked one another, “What can this mean?”</verse>
  <verse number="13">But others, scornfully jeering, said, “They are brim-full of sweet wine.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">Peter however, together with the Eleven, stood up and addressed them in a loud voice. “Men of Judaea, and all you inhabitants of Jerusalem,” he said, “be in no uncertainty about this matter but pay attention to what I say.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For this is not intoxication, as you suppose, it being only the third hour of the day.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But that which was predicted through the Prophet Joel has happened:</verse>
  <verse number="17">“And it shall come to pass in the last days, God says, that I will pour out My Spirit upon all mankind; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall have dreams;</verse>
  <verse number="18">and even upon My bondservants, both men and women, at that time, I will pour out My Spirit, and they shall prophesy.</verse>
  <verse number="19">I will display marvels in the sky above, and signs on the earth below, blood and fire, and pillars of smoke.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, to usher in the day of the Lord—that great and illustrious day;</verse>
  <verse number="21">and every one who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.’</verse>
  <verse number="22">“Listen, Israelites, to what I say. Jesus, the Nazarene, a man accredited to you from God by miracles and marvels and signs which God did among you through Him, as you yourselves know, Him—</verse>
  <verse number="23">delivered up through God’s settled purpose and foreknowledge—you by the hands of Gentiles have nailed to a cross and have put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But God has raised Him to life, having terminated the throes of death, for in fact it was not possible for Him to be held fast by death.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For David says in reference to Him, “’I constantly fixed my eyes upon the Lord, because He is at my right hand in order that I may continue unshaken.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For this reason my heart is glad and my tongue exults. My body also shall rest in hope.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For Thou wilt not leave me in the Unseen World forsaken, nor give up Thy holy One to undergo decay.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Thou hast made known to me the ways of Life: Thou wilt fill me with gladness in Thy presence.’</verse>
  <verse number="29">“As to the patriarch David, I need hardly remind you, brethren, that he died and was buried, and that we still have his tomb among us.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Being a Prophet, however, and knowing that God had solemnly sworn to him to seat a descendant of his upon his throne,</verse>
  <verse number="31">with prophetic foresight he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, to the effect that He was not left forsaken in the Unseen World, nor did His body undergo decay.</verse>
  <verse number="32">This Jesus, God has raised to life—a fact to which all of us testify.</verse>
  <verse number="33">“Being therefore lifted high by the mighty hand of God, He has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out this which you see and hear.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For David did not ascend into Heaven, but he says himself, “’The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand</verse>
  <verse number="35">until I make thy foes a footstool under thy feet.’</verse>
  <verse number="36">“Therefore let the whole House of Israel know beyond all doubt that God has made Him both LORD and CHRIST—this Jesus whom you crucified.”</verse>
  <verse number="37">Stung to the heart by these words, they said to Peter and the rest of the Apostles, “Brethren, what are we to do?”</verse>
  <verse number="38">“Repent,” replied Peter, “and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, with a view to the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="39">For to you belongs the promise, and to your children, and to all who are far off, whoever the Lord our God may call.”</verse>
  <verse number="40">And with many more appeals he solemnly warned and entreated them, saying, “Escape from this crooked generation.”</verse>
  <verse number="41">Those, therefore, who joyfully welcomed his Message were baptized; and on that one day about three thousand persons were added to them;</verse>
  <verse number="42">and they were constant in listening to the teaching of the Apostles and in their attendance at the Communion, that is, the Breaking of the Bread, and at prayer.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Fear came upon every one, and many marvels and signs were done by the Apostles.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And all the believers kept together, and had everything in common.</verse>
  <verse number="45">They sold their lands and other property, and distributed the proceeds among all, according to every one’s necessities.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And, day by day, attending constantly in the Temple with one accord, and breaking bread in private houses, they took their meals with great happiness and single-heartedness,</verse>
  <verse number="47">praising God and being regarded with favour by all the people. Also, day by day, the Lord added to their number those whom He was saving.</verse>
