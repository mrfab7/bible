<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="10" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint on myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I will say to God, Do not condemn me; show me why you contend with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is it good to you that you should oppress, that you should despise the work of your hands, and shine on the counsel of the wicked?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Have you eyes of flesh? or see you as man sees?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Are your days as the days of man? are your years as manâ€™s days,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">That you enquire after my iniquity, and search after my sin?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">You know that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of your hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Your hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet you do destroy me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Remember, I beseech you, that you have made me as the clay; and will you bring me into dust again?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Have you not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">You have clothed me with skin and flesh, and have fenced me with bones and sinews.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">You have granted me life and favor, and your visitation has preserved my spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And these things have you hid in your heart: I know that this is with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If I sin, then you mark me, and you will not acquit me from my iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If I be wicked, woe to me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see you my affliction;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For it increases. You hunt me as a fierce lion: and again you show yourself marvelous on me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">You renew your witnesses against me, and increase your indignation on me; changes and war are against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Why then have you brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Before I go from where I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.</p>
