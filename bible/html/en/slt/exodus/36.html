<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Bezaleel made, and Aholiab, and every man wise of heart, to whom Jehovah gave wisdom and understanding in them to know to do all the work of service of the holy place according to all which Jehovah commanded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Moses will call to Bezaleel and to Aholiab, and to every man wise of heart, to whom Jehovah gave wisdom in his heart, every one who lifted up his heart to draw near to the work to do it:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they will take from before Moses all the offering which the sons of Israel brought for the work of the service of the holy place to do it. And they brought to him yet a voluntary gift in the morning by morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And all the wise will come, doing the work of the holy place; a man a man from his work which they were doing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And they will say to Moses, saying, The people are multiplying to bring more than enough to the service for the work which Jehovah commanded to do it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Moses will command, and they will make a voice pass through in the camp, saying, A man and woman shall do no more work for the offering of the holy place. And the people will withhold from bringing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the work was enough for all the work to do it, and more than enough.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And all the wise of heart will work in doing the work of the temple: ten curtains of twisted byssus and cerulean purple, and red purple, and double scarlet; Cherubs a skilful work he made them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The length of the one curtain, eight and twenty by the cubit, and the breadth, four by the cubit of the one curtain: one length to all the curtains.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he will bind together the five curtains, the one to the one: and the curtains he joined the one to the one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And he will make loops of cerulean purple upon the lip of the one curtain from the end from the joining: thus he made in the lip of the last curtain in the joining of the second.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Fifty loops he made in the one curtain, and fifty loops he made in the end of the curtain which is in the joining of the second; the loops being over against the one to the one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And he shall make fifty gold hooks, and shall join together the curtains, one to the one, with the hooks: and it shall be one temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he shall make curtains of goatsâ€™ hair for the tent over the temple: eleven curtains he made them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The length of the one curtain thirty by the cubit, and four cubits the breadth of the one curtain: one length to the eleven curtains.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he will join five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he will make fifty loops upon the lip of the curtain the extreme part in the joining, and fifty loops he made upon the lip of the curtain joining the second.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he will make fifty brass hooks to join the tent together to be one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And he will make a covering for the tent, skins of rams made red, and a covering of tahash skins from above.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And he will make boards for the temple of acacia wood, standing up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Ten cubits the length of the board, and a cubit and a half a cubit, the breadth of the one board.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Two hands to the one board, joined together one to the one: thus he made for all the boards of the temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he will make boards for the temple, twenty boards for the south side southward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And forty bases of silver, he made the twenty boards; two bases under the one board, for its two hands, and two bases under one board for its two hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And for the second rib of the temple for the north side, he made twenty boards,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And their forty bases of silver; two bases under the one board, and two bases under the one board.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And for the hinder parts of the temple to the sea he made six boards.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And two boards he made for the angles of the temple in the hinder parts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And they were double from beneath, and they will be joined, they will be complete at its head to the one ring; thus he did to two of them for the two angles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And there were eight boards; and their bases of silver, sixteen bases; two bases, two bases under the one board.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And he will make bars of acacia wood; five for the boards of the one rib of the temple,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And five bars for the second rib of the temple, and five bars for the boards of the temple, for the hinder parts to the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And he made the middle bar to pass through in the midst of the boards from the end to the end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And he spread over the boards with gold, and he made their rings of gold, the inner parts for the bars, and he will spread over the bars with gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And he will make a vail of cerulean purple, red purple, double scarlet and twisted byssus: a skilful work he made it cherubs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And he will make to it four acacia pillars, and he will spread them over with gold: and their pegs gold; and he cast for them four bases of silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And he will make a covering for the door of the tent of cerulean purple, and red purple, and double scarlet, and twisted byssus, a variegated work;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And its five pillars and their pegs: and he spread over their heads and their joinings with gold; and their five bases brass.</p>
