  <verse number="1">BE ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things you are mindful of me: and keep my ordinances as I have delivered them to you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered, disgraceth his head.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But every woman praying or prophesying with her head not covered, disgraceth her head: for it is all one as if she were shaven.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For if a woman be not covered, let her be shorn. But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald, let her cover her head.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The man indeed ought not to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore ought the woman to have a power over her head, because of the angels.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But yet neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all things of God.</verse>
  <verse number="13">You yourselves judge: doth it become a woman, to pray unto God uncovered?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Doth not even nature itself teach you, that a man indeed, if he nourish his hair, it is a shame unto him?</verse>
  <verse number="15">But if a woman nourish her hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the church of God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Now this I ordain: not praising you, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For first of all I hear that when you come together in the church, there are schisms among you; and in part I believe it.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For there must be also heresies: that they also, who are approved, may be made manifest among you.</verse>
  <verse number="20">When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat the Lord’s supper.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk.</verse>
  <verse number="22">What, have you not houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God; and put them to shame that have not ? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise you not.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And giving thanks, broke, and said: Take ye, and eat: this is my body, which shall be delivered for you: this do for the commemoration of me.</verse>
  <verse number="25">In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread, or drink the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of the chalice.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Therefore are there many inform and weak among you, and many sleep.</verse>
  <verse number="31">But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.</verse>
  <verse number="34">If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order, when I come.</verse>
