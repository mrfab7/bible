<chapter book="2 Chronicles" number="11" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he mobilized the house of Judah and Benjamin—180,000 chosen warriors—to fight against Israel and restore the kingdom to Rehoboam.</verse>
  <verse number="2">But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God:</verse>
  <verse number="3">“Tell Rehoboam son of Solomon king of Judah and all the Israelites in Judah and Benjamin</verse>
  <verse number="4">that this is what the LORD says: ‘You are not to go up and fight against your brothers. Each of you must return home, for this is My doing.’” So they listened to the words of the LORD and turned back from going against Jeroboam.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem, and he built up cities for defense in Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He built up Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,</verse>
  <verse number="7">Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam,</verse>
  <verse number="8">Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,</verse>
  <verse number="9">Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,</verse>
  <verse number="10">Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, the fortified cities in Judah and Benjamin.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He strengthened their fortifications and put officers in them, with supplies of food, oil, and wine.</verse>
  <verse number="12">He also put shields and spears in all the cities and strengthened them greatly. So Judah and Benjamin belonged to him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Moreover, the priests and Levites from all their districts throughout Israel stood with Rehoboam.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For the Levites left their pasturelands and their possessions and went to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons had rejected them as priests of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Jeroboam appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat demons and calf idols he had made.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Those from every tribe of Israel who had set their hearts to seek the LORD their God followed the Levites to Jerusalem to sacrifice to the LORD, the God of their fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="17">So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam son of Solomon for three years, because they walked for three years in the way of David and Solomon.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Rehoboam married Mahalath, who was the daughter of David’s son Jerimoth and of Abihail, the daughter of Jesse’s son Eliab.</verse>
  <verse number="19">She bore sons to him: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.</verse>
  <verse number="20">After her, he married Maacah daughter of Absalom, and she bore to him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Rehoboam loved Maacah daughter of Absalom more than all his wives and concubines. In all, he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and he was the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maacah as chief prince among his brothers, intending to make him king.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Rehoboam also acted wisely by dispersing some of his sons throughout the districts of Judah and Benjamin, and to all the fortified cities. He gave them abundant provisions and sought many wives for them.</verse>
