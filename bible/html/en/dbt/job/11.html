<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Zophar the Naamathite answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man of much talk be justified?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Should thy fictions make men hold their peace? and shouldest thou mock, and no one make [thee] ashamed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For thou sayest, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But oh that +God would speak, and open his lips against thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, how that they are the double of what is realised; and know that +God passeth by [much] of thine iniquity!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Canst thou by searching find out +God? canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">[It is as] the heights of heaven; what wilt thou do? deeper than Sheol; what canst thou know?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If he pass by, and shut up, and call to judgment, who can hinder him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For he knoweth vain men, and seeth wickedness when [man] doth not consider it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Yet a senseless man will make bold, though man be born [like] the foal of a wild ass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If thou prepare thy heart and stretch out thy hands toward him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If thou put far away the iniquity which is in thy hand, and let not wrong dwell in thy tents;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot, and thou shalt be stedfast and shalt not fear:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For thou shalt forget misery; as waters that are passed away shalt thou remember it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And life shall arise brighter than noonday; though thou be enshrouded in darkness, thou shalt be as the morning,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And thou shalt have confidence, because there shall be hope; and having searched about [thee], thou shalt take rest in safety.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Yea, thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; and many shall seek thy favour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and [all] refuge shall vanish from them, and their hope [shall be] the breathing out of life.</p>
