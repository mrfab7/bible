  <verse number="1">For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, Doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah Stay and staff, Every stay of bread, and every stay of water;</verse>
  <verse number="2">The mighty man, and the man of war; The judge, and the prophet, And the diviner, and the elder;</verse>
  <verse number="3">The captain of fifty, and the man of rank, And the counsellor, and the cunning charmer, and the skilful enchanter.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And I will give children to be their princes, And babes shall rule over them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the people shall oppress one another, Every man his fellow, and every man his neighbour; The child shall behave insolently against the aged, And the base against the honourable,</verse>
  <verse number="6">For a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father: ‘Thou hast a mantle, Be thou our ruler, And let this ruin be under thy hand.’</verse>
  <verse number="7">In that day shall he swear, saying: ‘I will not be a healer; For in my house is neither bread nor a mantle; Ye shall not make me ruler of a people.’</verse>
  <verse number="8">For Jerusalem is ruined, And Judah is fallen; Because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, To provoke the eyes of His glory.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The show of their countenance doth witness against them; And they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! For they have wrought evil unto themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Say ye of the righteous, that it shall be well with him; For they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him; For the work of his hands shall be done to him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">As for My people, a babe is their master, And women rule over them. O My people, they that lead thee cause thee to err, And destroy the way of thy paths.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The LORD standeth up to plead, And standeth to judge the peoples.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The LORD will enter into judgment With the elders of His people, and the princes thereof: ‘It is ye that have eaten up the vineyard; The spoil of the poor is in your houses;</verse>
  <verse number="15">What mean ye that ye crush My people, And grind the face of the poor?’ Saith the Lord, the GOD of hosts.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Moreover the LORD said: Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, And walk with stretched-forth necks And wanton eyes, Walking and mincing as they go, And making a tinkling with their feet;</verse>
  <verse number="17">Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab The crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, And the LORD will lay bare their secret parts.</verse>
  <verse number="18">In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their anklets, and the fillets, and the crescents;</verse>
  <verse number="19">the pendants, and the bracelets, and the veils;</verse>
  <verse number="20">the headtires, and the armlets, and the sashes, and the corselets, and the amulets;</verse>
  <verse number="21">the rings, and the nose-jewels;</verse>
  <verse number="22">the aprons, and the mantelets, and the cloaks, and the girdles;</verse>
  <verse number="23">and the gauze robes, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the mantles.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And it shall come to pass, that Instead of sweet spices there shall be rottenness; And instead of a girdle rags; And instead of curled hair baldness; And instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; Branding instead of beauty.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Thy men shall fall by the sword, And thy mighty in the war.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And her gates shall lament and mourn; And utterly bereft she shall sit upon the ground.</verse>
