<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Call now if there be any that will answer thee, and turn to some of the saints.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Anger indeed killeth the foolish, and envy slayeth the little one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I have seen a fool with a strong root, and I cursed his beauty immediately.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">His children shall be far from safety, and shall be destroyed in the gate, and there shall be none to deliver them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Whose harvest the hungry shall eat, and the armed man shall take him by violence, and the thirsty shall drink up his riches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Nothing upon earth is done without a voice cause, and sorrow doth not spring out of the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Man is born to labour and the bird to fly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Wherefore I will pray to the Lord, and address my speech to God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who doth great things and unsearchable and wonderful things without number:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who giveth rain upon the face of the earth, and watereth all things with waters:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Who setteth up the humble on high, and comforteth with health those that mourn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Who bringeth to nought the designs of the malignant, so that their hands cannot accomplish what they had begun:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who catcheth the wise in their craftiness, and disappointeth the counsel of the wicked:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">They shall meet with darkness in the day, and grope at noonday as in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But he shall save the needy from the sword of their mouth, and the poor from the hand of the violent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And to the needy there shall he hope, but iniquity shall draw in her mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Blessed is the man whom God correcteth: refuse not therefore the chastising of the lord:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For he woundeth, and cureth: he striketh, and his hands shall heal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">In six troubles he shall deliver thee, and in the seventh, evil shall not touch thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In famine he shall deliver thee from death: and in battle, from the hand of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Thou shalt he hidden from the scourge of the tongue: and thou shalt not fear calamity when it cometh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">In destruction and famine then shalt laugh: and thou shalt not be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But thou shalt have a covenant with the stones of the lands, and the beasts of the earth shall be at pence with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle is in peace, and visiting thy beauty thou shalt not sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be multiplied, and thy offspring like the grass of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Thou shalt enter into the grave in abundance, as a heap of wheat is brought in its season.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Behold, this is even so, as we have searched oat: which thou having heard, consider it thoroughly in thy mind.</p>
