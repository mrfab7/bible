  <verse number="1">And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these were the years of the life of Sarah.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="4">I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a burial plot with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,</verse>
  <verse number="6">Hear us, my lord: you are a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchers bury your dead; none of us shall withhold from you his sepulcher, but that you may bury your dead.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the children of Heth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar,</verse>
  <verse number="9">That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a burial plot among you.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Ephron dwelled among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="11">No, my lord, hear me: the field give I you, and the cave that is therein, I give it you; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it you: bury your dead.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if you will give it, I pray you, hear me: I will give you money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,</verse>
  <verse number="15">My lord, listen to me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that between me and you? bury therefore your dead.</verse>

  <verse number="17">And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure</verse>
  <verse number="18">To Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.</verse>
