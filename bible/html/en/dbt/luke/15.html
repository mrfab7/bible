<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And all the tax-gatherers and the sinners were coming near to him to hear him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, This [man] receives sinners and eats with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he spoke to them this parable, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">What man of you having a hundred sheep, and having lost one of them, does not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost, until he find it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and having found it, he lays it upon his own shoulders, rejoicing;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and being come to the house, calls together the friends and the neighbours, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my lost sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I say unto you, that thus there shall be joy in heaven for one repenting sinner, [more] than for ninety and nine righteous who have no need of repentance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Or, what woman having ten drachmas, if she lose one drachma, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek carefully till she find it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and having found it she calls together the friends and neighbours, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thus, I say unto you, there is joy before the angels of God for one repenting sinner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And he said, A certain man had two sons;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give to me the share of the property that falls [to me]. And he divided to them what he was possessed of.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And after not many days the younger son gathering all together went away into a country a long way off, and there dissipated his property, living in debauchery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But when he had spent all there arose a violent famine throughout that country, and he began to be in want.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he went and joined himself to one of the citizens of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he longed to fill his belly with the husks which the swine were eating; and no one gave to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And coming to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my fatherâ€™s have abundance of bread, and I perish here by famine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I will rise up and go to my father, and I will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I am no longer worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And he rose up and went to his own father. But while he was yet a long way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and ran, and fell upon his neck, and covered him with kisses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the son said to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee; I am no longer worthy to be called thy son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But the father said to his bondmen, Bring out the best robe and clothe him in [it], and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">and bring the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and make merry:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">for this my son was dead and has come to life, was lost and has been found. And they began to make merry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And his elder son was in the field; and as, coming [up], he drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And having called one of the servants, he inquired what these things might be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And he said to him, Thy brother is come, and thy father has killed the fatted calf because he has received him safe and well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">But he became angry and would not go in. And his father went out and besought him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">But he answering said to his father, Behold, so many years I serve thee, and never have I transgressed a commandment of thine; and to me hast thou never given a kid that I might make merry with my friends:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">but when this thy son, who has devoured thy substance with harlots, is come, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But he said to him, Child, thou art ever with me, and all that is mine is thine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">But it was right to make merry and rejoice, because this thy brother was dead and has come to life again, and was lost and has been found.</p>
