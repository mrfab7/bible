<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Shall vain words have an end? or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I also could speak as ye do; if your soul were in my soulâ€™s stead, I could join words together against you, and shake mine head at you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the solace of my lips should assuage your grief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And thou hast laid fast hold on me, which is a witness against me: and my leanness riseth up against me, it testifieth to my face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He hath torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me; he hath gnashed upon me with his teeth: mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully: they gather themselves together against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">God delivereth me to the ungodly, and casteth me into the hands of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I was at ease, and he brake me asunder; yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces: he hath also set me up for his mark.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He breaketh me with breach upon breach; he runneth upon me like a giant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and have laid my horn in the dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Although there is no violence in mine hands, and my prayer is pure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no resting place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and he that coucheth for me is on high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">That he would maintain the right of a man with God, and of a son of man with his neighbour!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For when a few years are come, I shall go the way whence I shall not return.</p>
