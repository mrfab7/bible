<p class="verse" data-verse="1">LET not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">In my Father’s house there are many mansions. If not, I would have told you: because I go to prepare a place for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And if I shall go, and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will take you to myself; that where I am, you also may be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And whither I go you know, and the way you know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thomas saith to him: Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Jesus saith to him: I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No man cometh to the Father, but by me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If you had known me, you would without doubt have known my Father also: and from henceforth you shall know him, and you have seen him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Philip saith to him: Lord, shew us the Father, and it is enough for us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Jesus saith to him: Have I been so long a time with you; and have you not known me? Philip, he that seeth me seeth the Father also. How sayest thou, Shew us the Father?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Do you not believe, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak to you, I speak not of myself. But the Father who abideth in me, he doth the works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Otherwise believe for the very works’ sake. Amen, amen I say to you, he that believeth in me, the works that I do, he also shall do; and greater than these shall he do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Because I go to the Father: and whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, that will I do: that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If you shall ask me any thing in my name, that I will do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If you love me, keep my commandments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another Paraclete, that he may abide with you for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, nor knoweth him: but you shall know him; because he shall abide with you, and shall be in you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I will not leave you orphans, I will come to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Yet a little while: and the world seeth me no more. But you see me: because I live, and you shall live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In that day you shall know, that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them; he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father: and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Judas saith to him, not the Iscariot: Lord, how is it, that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Jesus answered, and said to him: If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and will make our abode with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He that loveth me not, keepeth not my words. And the word which you have heard, is not mine; but the Father’s who sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">These things have I spoken to you, abiding with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But the Paraclete, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things, and bring all things to your mind, whatsoever I shall have said to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, do I give unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor let it be afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">You have heard that I said to you: I go away, and I come unto you. If you loved me, you would indeed be glad, because I go to the Father: for the Father is greater than I.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And now I have told you before it comes to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">I will not now speak many things with you. For the prince of this world cometh, and in me he hath not any thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But that the world may know, that I love the Father: and as the Father hath given me commandment, so do I: Arise, let us go hence.</p>
