<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Send ye a lamb to the ruler to the land, from the rock of the desert to the mountain of the daughter of Zion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it shall be as the bird fleeing, the nest cast out, the daughters of Moab shall be from the passages to Arnon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Bring ye counsel, do judgment; place as the night thy shadow in the midst of noon; hide the driven out; thou shalt not betray the fugitive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The outcast shall dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covering to them from the face of him laying waste: for the oppressor ceased, violence was finished, the treaders-down were consumed out of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the throne was set up in mercy: and he sat upon it in truth in the tent of David, judging and seeking judgment, and hastening justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">We heard the pride of Moab; he was greatly elated; his haughtiness and his pride and his wrath; not so his empty talk.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For this shall Moab wail for Moab, every one shall wail: for the foundations of the wall of Haresheth shall ye sigh; surely they were smitten.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For the fields of Heshbon languished, the vine of Sibmah: the lords of the nations struck its vine of purple grapes, they reached even to Jazer, they wandered to the desert: her sprouts were thrust out, they passed over the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For this I will weep with the weeping of Jazer the vine of Sibmah; I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon and Elealah: for upon thy fruit harvest and upon thy harvest the vintage shout fell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And joy and gladness was taken away from Carmel, and in the vineyards there shall be no shout for joy, there shall be no cry with a loud voice: and he treading shall not tread out wine in the wine-vat: I caused the vintage shout to cease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For this my bowels shall sound as a harp for Moab, and my inner parts for the wall of Haresh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And it was when it was seen that Moab was weary upon the height, and coming to his holy place to pray and he shall not be able.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">This the word which Jehovah spake to Moab from that time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And now Jehovah spake, saying, In three years as the years of a hireling and the honor of Moab despised with with all the great multitude; and the remnant being small, not great.</p>
