<div class="chapter" data-book="Ezekiel" data-chapter="3" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover he said to me, Son of man, eat that you find; eat this roll, and go speak to the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he said to me, Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your bowels with this roll that I give you. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he said to me, Son of man, go, get you to the house of Israel, and speak with my words to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words you can not understand. Surely, had I sent you to them, they would have listened to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But the house of Israel will not listen to you; for they will not listen to me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">As an adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And go, get you to them of the captivity, to the children of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus said the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong on me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelled by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">When I say to the wicked, You shall surely die; and you give him not warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Yet if you warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Again, When a righteous man does turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at your hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also you have delivered your soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the hand of the LORD was there on me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Then the spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet, and spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut yourself within your house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But you, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands on you, and shall bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And I will make your tongue sticks to the roof of your mouth, that you shall be dumb, and shall not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; He that hears, let him hear; and he that declines, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</p>
