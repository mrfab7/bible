  <verse number="1">My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.</verse>
  <verse number="3">[Is it] good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?</verse>
  <verse number="5">[Are] thy days as the days of man? [are] thy years as man’s days,</verse>
  <verse number="6">That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and [there is] none that can deliver out of thine hand.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And these [things] hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this [is] with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="14">If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="15">If I be wicked, woe unto me; and [if] I be righteous, [yet] will I not lift up my head. [I am] full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;</verse>
  <verse number="16">For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war [are] against me.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!</verse>
  <verse number="19">I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</verse>
  <verse number="20">[Are] not my days few? cease [then, and] let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,</verse>
  <verse number="21">Before I go [whence] I shall not return, [even] to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;</verse>
  <verse number="22">A land of darkness, as darkness [itself; and] of the shadow of death, without any order, and [where] the light [is] as darkness.</verse>
