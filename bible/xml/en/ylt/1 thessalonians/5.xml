<chapter book="1 Thessalonians" number="5" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need of my writing to you,</verse>
  <verse number="2">for yourselves have known thoroughly that the day of the Lord as a thief in the night doth so come,</verse>
  <verse number="3">for when they may say, Peace and surety, then sudden destruction doth stand by them, as the travail doth her who is with child, and they shall not escape;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day may catch you as a thief;</verse>
  <verse number="5">all ye are sons of light, and sons of day; we are not of night, nor of darkness,</verse>
  <verse number="6">so, then, we may not sleep as also the others, but watch and be sober,</verse>
  <verse number="7">for those sleeping, by night do sleep, and those making themselves drunk, by night are drunken,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and we, being of the day—let us be sober, putting on a breastplate of faith and love, and an helmet—a hope of salvation,</verse>
  <verse number="9">because God did not appoint us to anger, but to the acquiring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
  <verse number="10">who did die for us, that whether we wake—whether we sleep—together with him we may live;</verse>
  <verse number="11">wherefore, comfort ye one another, and build ye up, one the one, as also ye do.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And we ask you, brethren, to know those labouring among you, and leading you in the Lord, and admonishing you,</verse>
  <verse number="13">and to esteem them very abundantly in love, because of their work; be at peace among yourselves;</verse>
  <verse number="14">and we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the infirm, be patient unto all;</verse>
  <verse number="15">see no one evil for evil may render to any one, but always that which is good pursue ye, both to one another and to all;</verse>
  <verse number="16">always rejoice ye;</verse>
  <verse number="17">continually pray ye;</verse>
  <verse number="18">in every thing give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus in regard to you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The Spirit quench not;</verse>
  <verse number="20">prophesyings despise not;</verse>
  <verse number="21">all things prove; that which is good hold fast;</verse>
  <verse number="22">from all appearance of evil abstain ye;</verse>
  <verse number="23">and the God of the peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your whole spirit, and soul, and body, be preserved unblameably in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="24">stedfast is He who is calling you, who also will do it.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Brethren, pray for us;</verse>
  <verse number="26">salute all the brethren in an holy kiss;</verse>
  <verse number="27">I charge you by the Lord, that the letter be read to all the holy brethren;</verse>
  <verse number="28">the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with you! Amen.</verse>
