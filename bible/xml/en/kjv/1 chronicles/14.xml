  <verse number="1">Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Now these [are] the names of [his] children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard [of it], and went out against them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.</verse>
  <verse number="11">So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baalperazim.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Therefore David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, [that] then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.</verse>
  <verse number="16">David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD brought the fear of him upon all nations.</verse>
