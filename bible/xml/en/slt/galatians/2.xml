  <verse number="1">Then after fourteen years, again went I up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, having taken together Titus.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And I went up according to revelation, and placed before them the good news which I proclaim in the nations, but apart to them highly esteemed, lest I run in vain, or ran.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But neither Titus, with me, being a Greek, was forced to be circumcised:</verse>
  <verse number="4">And through false brethren introduced privately, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might reduce us to slavery:</verse>
  <verse number="5">To whom we yielded in subjection, not for an hour; that the truth of the good news might remain with you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And from them seeming to be something, (whatever they were, it concerns me nothing: God receives not man’s face:) for they seeming entrusted nothing to me:</verse>
  <verse number="7">But on the contrary, having seen that I have been entrusted with the good news of uncircumcision, as Peter of circumcision;</verse>
  <verse number="8">(For be having been energetic in Peter for the mission of circumcision, was energetic also in me for the nations:)</verse>
  <verse number="9">And having known the grace given to me, James, and Cephas, and John, seeming to be pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hands of communion; that we for the nations, and they for the circumcision.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Only that we remember the poor; and this same was I forward to do.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to the face, for he was to be rebuked.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For before certain came from James, he ate with the nations: and when they came, he drew down, and separated himself, being afraid of them of the circumcision.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the rest of the Jews also dissembled with him; so that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But when I saw that they went not upon the strait road according to the truth of the good news, I said to Peter before all, If thou, being a Jew, livest according to the nations, and not according to the Jews, why forcest thou the nations to live as the Jews?</verse>
  <verse number="15">We by nature Jews, and not sinners from the nations,</verse>
  <verse number="16">Knowing that a man is not justified from the works of the law, but through faith of Jesus Christ, and we believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified from the faith of Christ, and not from the works of the law: therefore from the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And it; seeking to be justified in Christ, we were found also ourselves sinners, is Christ therefore the servant of sin? It may not be.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For if what I destroy, these I build again, I unite myself with the transgressor.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For I through the law died to the law, that. I might live to God.</verse>
  <verse number="20">I am crucified with Christ: and I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in we: and what I now live in the flesh I live in the faith of the Son of God, having loved me, and given himself for me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">I put not away the grace of God for if justice through the law, Christ died in vain.</verse>
