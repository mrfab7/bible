<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, attend to my wisdom, and bow your ear to my understanding:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">That you may regard discretion, and that your lips may keep knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Lest you should ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that you can not know them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Hear me now therefore, O you children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Remove your way far from her, and come not near the door of her house:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Lest strangers be filled with your wealth; and your labors be in the house of a stranger;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And you mourn at the last, when your flesh and your body are consumed,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to them that instructed me!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I was almost in all evil in the middle of the congregation and assembly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Drink waters out of your own cistern, and running waters out of your own well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let your fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Let them be only your own, and not strangers’ with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Let your fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of your youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy you at all times; and be you ravished always with her love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And why will you, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his goings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be held with the cords of his sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</p>
