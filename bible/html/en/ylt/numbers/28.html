<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">‘Command the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto them, My offering, My bread for My fire-offerings, My sweet fragrance, ye take heed to bring near to Me in its appointed season.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And thou hast said to them, This is the fire-offering which ye bring near to Jehovah: two lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones, daily, a continual burnt-offering;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">the one lamb thou preparest in the morning, and the second lamb thou preparest between the evenings;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and a tenth of the ephah of flour for a present, mixed with beaten oil, a fourth of the hin;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">a continual burnt-offering, which was made in mount Sinai, for sweet fragrance, a fire-offering to Jehovah;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and its libation, a fourth of the hin for the one lamb; in the sanctuary cause thou a libation of strong drink to be poured out to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">‘And the second lamb thou dost prepare between the evenings; as the present of the morning, and as its libation thou preparest—a fire-offering, a sweet fragrance to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">‘And on the sabbath-day, two lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones, and two-tenth deals of flour, a present, mixed with oil, and its libation;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">the burnt-offering of the sabbath in its sabbath, besides the continual burnt-offering and its libation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">‘And in the beginnings of your months ye bring near a burnt-offering to Jehovah: two bullocks, sons of the herd, and one ram, seven lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">and three-tenth deals of flour, a present, mixed with oil, for the one bullock, and two-tenth deals of flour, a present, mixed with oil, for the one ram;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and a several tenth deal of flour, a present, mixed with oil, for the one lamb; a burnt-offering, a sweet fragrance, a fire-offering to Jehovah;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and their libations are a half of the hin to a bullock, and a third of the hin to a ram, and a fourth of the hin to a lamb, of wine; this is the burnt-offering of every month for the months of the year;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and one kid of the goats for a sin-offering to Jehovah; besides the continual burnt-offering it is prepared, and its libation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And in the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, is the passover to Jehovah;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">and in the fifteenth day of this month is a festival, seven days unleavened food is eaten;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">in the first day is an holy convocation, ye do no servile work,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and ye have brought near a fire-offering, a burnt-offering to Jehovah: two bullocks, sons of the herd, and one ram, and seven lambs, sons of a year, perfect ones they are for you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">and their present, flour mixed with oil, three-tenth deals for a bullock, and two-tenth deals for a ram ye do prepare;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">a several tenth deal thou preparest for the one lamb, for the seven lambs,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">and one goat, a sin-offering, to make atonement for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Apart from the burnt-offering of the morning, which is for the continual burnt-offering, ye prepare these;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">according to these ye prepare daily, seven days, bread of a fire-offering, a sweet fragrance, to Jehovah; besides the continual burnt-offering it is prepared, and its libation;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">and on the seventh day a holy convocation ye have, ye do no servile work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">‘And in the day of the first-fruits, in your bringing near a new present to Jehovah, in your weeks, a holy convocation ye have; ye do no servile work;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">and ye have brought near a burnt-offering for sweet fragrance to Jehovah: two bullocks, sons of the herd, one ram, seven lambs, sons of a year,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">and their present, flour mixed with oil, three-tenth deals to the one bullock, two-tenth deals to the one ram,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">a several tenth deal to the one lamb, for the seven lambs;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">one kid of the goats to make atonement for you;</p>
