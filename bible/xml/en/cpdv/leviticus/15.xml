  <verse number="13">If he who suffers from this affliction will have been healed, he shall number seven days after his cleansing, and having washed his clothes and his entire body in living water, he shall be clean.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then, on the eighth day, he shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, and he shall advance, in the sight of the Lord, toward the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, and he shall give these to the priest,</verse>
  <verse number="15">who shall offer one for sin, and the other as a holocaust. And he shall pray for him before the Lord, so that he may be cleansed from the flow of his seed.</verse>

  <verse number="25">The woman who undergoes a flow of blood many days beyond her time of menstruation, or whose blood does not cease to flow after the menstrual blood, as long as she is subject to this affliction, she shall be unclean, just as if she were in her time of menstruation.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Every bed on which she sleeps, and every item on which she sits, shall be polluted.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Whoever will have touched these shall wash his clothes, and having washed himself with water, he shall be unclean until evening.</verse>
  <verse number="28">If the blood has stopped and has ceased to flow, she shall number seven days for her purification,</verse>
  <verse number="29">and on the eighth day she shall offer for herself, to the priest, two turtledoves or two young pigeons, at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And he shall offer one for sin, and the other as a holocaust, and he shall pray for her before the Lord, and for the flow of her uncleanness.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Therefore, you shall teach the sons of Israel to be cautious of uncleanness, so that they may not die in their filth, when they will have polluted my tabernacle, which is among them.</verse>
  <verse number="32">This is the law of him who undergoes a flow of seed, or who is polluted by sexual intercourse,</verse>
  <verse number="33">and of her who is separated in the time of menstruation, or who has a continual flow of blood, and of the man who sleeps with her.</verse>
