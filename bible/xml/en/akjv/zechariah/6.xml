<chapter book="Zechariah" number="6" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And I turned, and lifted up my eyes, and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.</verse>
  <verse number="2">In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;</verse>
  <verse number="3">And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot spotted and bay horses.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then I answered and said to the angel that talked with me, What are these, my lord?</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the angel answered and said to me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the LORD of all the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The black horses which are therein go forth into the north country; and the white go forth after them; and the spotted go forth toward the south country.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then cried he on me, and spoke to me, saying, Behold, these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="10">Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come you the same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah;</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them on the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;</verse>
  <verse number="12">And speak to him, saying, Thus speaks the LORD of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the LORD:</verse>
  <verse number="13">Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule on his throne; and he shall be a priest on his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the LORD, and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you. And this shall come to pass, if you will diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.</verse>
