<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">to know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">to receive the instruction of wisdom, righteousness and judgment, and equity;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">to give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He that is wise will hear, and will increase learning; and the intelligent will gain wise counsels:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">to understand a proverb and an allegory, the words of the wise and their enigmas.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge: fools despise wisdom and instruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">for they shall be a garland of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">My son, if sinners entice thee, consent not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, and whole, as those that go down into the pit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">we shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">cast in thy lot among us; we will all have one purse:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">—my son, walk not in the way with them, keep back thy foot from their path;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For in vain the net is spread in the sight of anything which hath wings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And these lay wait for their own blood; they lurk secretly for their own lives.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">So are the paths of every one that is greedy of gain: it taketh away the life of its possessors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Wisdom crieth without; she raiseth her voice in the broadways;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">she calleth in the chief [place] of concourse, in the entry of the gates; in the city she uttereth her words:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">How long, simple ones, will ye love simpleness, and scorners take pleasure in their scorning, and the foolish hate knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour forth my spirit unto you, I will make known to you my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one regarded;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">and ye have rejected all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I also will laugh in your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">when your fear cometh as sudden destruction, and your calamity cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come upon you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">—then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me early, and shall not find me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Because they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of Jehovah;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">they would none of my counsel, they despised all my reproof:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their way, and be filled with their own devices.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of the foolish shall cause them to perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be at rest from fear of evil.</p>
