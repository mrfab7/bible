  <verse number="1">And Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he said to them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD has said to me, You shall not go over this Jordan.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The LORD your God, he will go over before you, and he will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall possess them: and Joshua, he shall go over before you, as the LORD has said.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the LORD shall do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings of the Amorites, and to the land of them, whom he destroyed.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that you may do to them according to all the commandments which I have commanded you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD your God, he it is that does go with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for you must go with this people to the land which the LORD has sworn to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to inherit it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the LORD, he it is that does go before you; he will be with you, he will not fail you, neither forsake you: fear not, neither be dismayed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, which bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,</verse>
  <verse number="11">When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD your God in the place which he shall choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and your stranger that is within your gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law:</verse>
  <verse number="13">And that their children, which have not known any thing, may hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as you live in the land where you go over Jordan to possess it.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the LORD said to Moses, Behold, your days approach that you must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the LORD said to Moses, Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come on us, because our God is not among us?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have worked, in that they are turned to other gods.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Now therefore write you this song for you, and teach it the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, that flows with milk and honey; and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong and of a good courage: for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them: and I will be with you.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,</verse>
  <verse number="25">That Moses commanded the Levites, which bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="26">Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against you.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against the LORD; and how much more after my death?</verse>
  <verse number="28">Gather to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to record against them.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because you will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And Moses spoke in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended.</verse>
