<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came unto the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And it came to pass, while they were perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and as they were affrighted, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">saying that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And they remembered his words,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James: and the other women with them told these things unto the apostles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And these words appeared in their sight as idle talk; and they disbelieved them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But Peter arose, and ran unto the tomb; and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths by themselves; and he departed to his home, wondering at that which was come to pass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was threescore furlongs from Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And they communed with each other of all these things which had happened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And it came to pass, while they communed and questioned together, that Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he said unto them, What communications are these that ye have one with another, as ye walk? And they stood still, looking sad.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And one of them, named Cleopas, answering said unto him, Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in these days?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But we hoped that it was he which should redeem Israel. Yea and beside all this, it is now the third day since these things came to pass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Moreover certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And certain of them that were with us went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And he said unto them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Behoved it not the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to abide with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And it came to pass, when he had sat down with them to meat, he took the bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And they said one to another, Was not our heart burning within us, while he spake to us in the way, while he opened to us the scriptures?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And they rehearsed the things that happened in the way, and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And as they spake these things, he himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do reasonings arise in your heart?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and his feet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And he took it, and did eat before them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, how that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Then opened he their mind, that they might understand the scriptures;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">Ye are witnesses of these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">And he led them out until they were over against Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">and were continually in the temple, blessing God.</p>
