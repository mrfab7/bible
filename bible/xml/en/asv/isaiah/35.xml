  <verse number="1">The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.</verse>
  <verse number="2">It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing; the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon: they shall see the glory of Jehovah, the excellency of our God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, with the recompense of God; he will come and save you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing; for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the glowing sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water: in the habitation of jackals, where they lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And a highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but is shall be for the redeemed: the wayfaring men, yea fools, shall not err therein.</verse>
  <verse number="9">No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast go up thereon; they shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there:</verse>
  <verse number="10">and the ransomed of Jehovah shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</verse>
