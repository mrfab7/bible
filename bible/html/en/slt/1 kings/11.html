<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And king Solomon loved many strange women, and the daughter of Pharaoh, Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, Hittites;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">From the nations which Jehovah said to the sons of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, and they shall not come in to you: surely they will turn your heart after their gods: to these Solomon joined to love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And there will be to him seven hundred chief wives, and three hundred concubines: and his wives will turn his heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And it will be at the time of the old age of Solomon his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with Jehovah his God as the heart of David his father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Solomon will go after Ashtaroth the god of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Solomon will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and he will not fill up after Jehovah as David his father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Then Solomon will build a height for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the mountain which is upon the face of Jerusalem, and for the king, the abomination of the sons of Ammon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And thus he did for all his strange wives, they burning incense and sacrificing to their gods.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Jehovah will be angry with Solomon, for his heart was turned from Jehovah the God of Israel, being seen to him twice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he commanded him concerning this word not to go after other gods: and he watched not what Jehovah commanded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Jehovah will say to Solomon, Because this was with thee, and thou didst not watch my covenant and my laws which I commanded upon thee, rending, I will rend the kingdom from thee and give it to thy servant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But in thy days I will not do it for sake of David thy father; out of the hand of thy son will I rend it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But I will not rend all the kingdom; one tribe I will give to thy son for sake of David my servant, and for sake of Jerusalem which I chose.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Jehovah will raise up an adversary to Solomon, Hadad the Edomite: he from the king’s seed in Edom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And it will be in David’s being in Edom, and in Joab the chief of the army going up, he came to bury the slain, and he will strike every male in Edom;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">(For six months Joab dwelt there and all Israel, till he cut off every male in Edom.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Hadad will flee, he and the men, Edomites, his father’s servants, with him to go to Egypt; and Hadad a small boy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And they will rise from Midian and come to Paran: and they will take men with them from Paran, and they will go to Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt; and he will give to him a house and spake bread for him, and gave to him land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Hadad will find favor in the eyes of Pharaoh greatly, and he will give to him a wife, sister of his wife, sister of Tahpenes the mistress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the sister of Tahpenes will bare to him Genubath his son, and Tahpenes will wean him in the midst of Pharaoh’s house: and Genubath will be in Pharaoh’s house in the midst of Pharaoh’s sons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Hadad heard in Egypt that David lay down with his fathers, and that Joab chief of the army died, and Hadad will say to Pharaoh, Send me away, and I will go to my land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Pharaoh will say to him, For what lackest thou with me, and behold thee seeking to go to thy land? and he will say, Naught: but sending, thou shalt send me away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And God will raise up to him an adversary, Rezon, son of Eliadah, who lied from Hadadezer king of Zobah his lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And he will gather to himself men, and he will be chief of a troop in David’s killing them; and they will go to Damascus and dwell in it and reign in Damascus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And he will be an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, and the evil which Hadad did: and he will abhor against Israel and he will reign over Aram.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And Jeroboam son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, and his mother’s name Zeruah, a widow woman, servant to Solomon, and he will lift up the hand against the king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And this the word for which he lifted up the hand against the king: Solomon built the fortress and shut up the breaches of the city of David his father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And the man Jeroboam mighty of strength: and Solomon will see the boy that he did work, and he will appoint him for the burden of the house of Joseph.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And it will be in that time, and Jeroboam went forth from Jerusalem, and Ahijah the Shilonite will find him going in the way; and he being covered with a new garment; and they two alone in the field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And Ahijah will lay hold upon the new garment which was upon him and will rend it in twelve rents:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And he will say to Jeroboam, Take to thee ten rents: for thus said Jehovah God of Israel, Behold me rending the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and I gave to thee ten tribes:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">(And the one tribe shall be to him, for sake of my servant David, and for sake of Jerusalem the city which I chose in it from all the tribes of Israel:)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Because they forsook me and worshiped to Ashtaroth the god of Zidon, and to Chemosh, god of Moab, and to Milcom, god of the sons of Ammon, and they went not in my way to do the straight in mine eyes, and my laws and my judgments as David his father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And I will not take all the kingdom from his hand, for I will set him chief all the days of his life for sake of David my servant whom I chose him, because he watched my commands and my laws.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And I took the kingdom from the hand of his son and gave it to thee, the ten tribes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And to his son I will give one tribe on account of there being a light to David my servant all the days before me in Jerusalem the city which I chose to me to put my name there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all which thy soul shall desire, and be king over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And being if thou shalt hear all that I shall command thee, and go in my way and do the straight in mine eyes to watch my laws and my commands as David my servant did, and I was with thee and built to thee a faithful house as I built to David, and I gave Israel to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And I will humble the seed of David for this, but not all the days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And Solomon will seek to kill Jeroboam, and Jeroboam will rise and flee to Egypt to Shishak, king of Egypt, and he will be in Egypt till the death of Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And the remainder of the words of Solomon and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written upon the book of the words of Solomon?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And the days which Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel were forty years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And Solomon will lie down with his fathers and be buried in the city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son will reign instead of him.</p>
