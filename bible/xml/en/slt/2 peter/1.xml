  <verse number="1">Simon Peter, servant and sent of Jesus Christ, to them having received by inheritance equally honoured faith with us in the justice of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="2">May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,</verse>
  <verse number="3">As his divine power having bestowed upon us all things which for life and devotion, by the knowledge of him having called us by glory and fitness:</verse>
  <verse number="4">(By which the greatest and precious promises are bestowed upon us: that by these ye might be having escaped from the corruption in the world through eager desires.)</verse>
  <verse number="5">And also this same, having brought in at the side all earnestness, furnish in addition in your faith fitness; and In fitness knowledge;</verse>
  <verse number="6">And in knowledge self-control; and in self-control patience; and in patience devotion;</verse>
  <verse number="7">And in devotion brotherly love; and in brotherly love, love.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For these being to you, and abounding, they establish you not without effort, neither unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For in whom these are not present, he is blind, being affected with shortness of sight, having taken forgetfulness of the cleansing formerly of his sins.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Wherefore rather, brethren, be earnest to have your calling and selection made firm: for doing these, ye should not once stumble:</verse>
  <verse number="11">For so shall an entrance be furnished richly to you in addition into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Wherefore I will not neglect to remind you always of these things, though having known, and being supported in the present truth.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And I deem just, in as far as I am in this tent, to arouse you by putting in mind;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Knowing that the laying aside of my tent is swift; as also our Lord Jesus Christ manifested to me.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And I shall also be earnest for you always to have, after my exit, this putting in mind to be done.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For not having followed ingeniously contrived fictions, we made known to you the power and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, but having been spectators of his majesty.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For having received from God the Father honour and glory, and such a voice brought to him from the magnificent glory, This is my dearly beloved Son, in whom I was contented.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And this voice brought from heaven we heard, being with him in the holy mountain.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And we have the prophetic word more firm; which holding to, ye do well, as to a light shining in a dusty place, even till the day shine through, and the morning star spring up in your hearts:</verse>
  <verse number="20">Knowing this first, that every prophecy of the writing is not of private solution.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For prophecy was not once brought by the will of man: but holy men of God spake, being moved by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
