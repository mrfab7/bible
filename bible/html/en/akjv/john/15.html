<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Every branch in me that bears not fruit he takes away: and every branch that bears fruit, he purges it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Now you are clean through the word which I have spoken to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can you, except you abide in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I am the vine, you are the branches: He that stays in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask what you will, and it shall be done to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Herein is my Father glorified, that you bear much fruit; so shall you be my disciples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you: continue you in my love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">These things have I spoken to you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">This is my commandment, That you love one another, as I have loved you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">From now on I call you not servants; for the servant knows not what his lord does: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that you should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">These things I command you, that you love one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If the world hate you, you know that it hated me before it hated you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If you were of the world, the world would love his own: but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Remember the word that I said to you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But all these things will they do to you for my name’s sake, because they know not him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloak for their sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He that hates me hates my Father also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But this comes to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And you also shall bear witness, because you have been with me from the beginning.</p>
