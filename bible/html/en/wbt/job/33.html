<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Behold, I am according to thy wish in God’s stead: I also am formed out of the clay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For God speaketh once, yes twice, yet man perceiveth it not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Yes, his soul draweth near to the grave, and his life to the destroyers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If there is a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man his uprightness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Then he is gracious to him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he will return to the days of his youth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He shall pray to God, and he will be favorable to him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render to man his righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He looketh upon men, and if any shall say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Lo, all these things God often worketh with man,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Mark well, O Job, hearken to me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If not, hearken to me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.</p>
