<chapter book="Proverbs" number="6" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, if you have struck hands in pledge with a stranger,</verse>
  <verse number="2">if you have been trapped by the words of your lips, ensnared by the words of your mouth,</verse>
  <verse number="3">then do this, my son, to free yourself, for you have fallen into your neighbor’s hands: Go, humble yourself, and press your plea with your neighbor.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Allow no sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Walk in the manner of the ant, O slacker; observe its ways and become wise.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Without a commander, without an overseer or ruler,</verse>
  <verse number="8">it prepares its provisions in summer; it gathers its food at harvest.</verse>
  <verse number="9">How long will you lie there, O slacker? When will you get up from your sleep?</verse>
  <verse number="10">A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,</verse>
  <verse number="11">and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and need like a bandit.</verse>
  <verse number="12">A worthless person, a wicked man, walks with a perverse mouth,</verse>
  <verse number="13">winking his eyes, speaking with his feet, and pointing with his fingers.</verse>
  <verse number="14">With deceit in his heart he devises evil; he continually sows discord.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in an instant he will be shattered beyond recovery.</verse>
  <verse number="16">There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are detestable to Him:</verse>
  <verse number="17">haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,</verse>
  <verse number="18">a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that run swiftly to evil,</verse>
  <verse number="19">a false witness who gives false testimony, and one who stirs up discord among brothers.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My son, keep your father’s commandment, and do not forsake your mother’s teaching.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Bind them always upon your heart; tie them around your neck.</verse>
  <verse number="22">When you walk, they will guide you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; when you awake, they will speak to you.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For this commandment is a lamp, this teaching is a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way to life,</verse>
  <verse number="24">to keep you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Do not lust in your heart for her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For the levy of the prostitute is poverty, and the adulteress preys upon your very life.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Can a man embrace fire and his clothes not be burned?</verse>
  <verse number="28">Can a man walk on hot coals without scorching his feet?</verse>
  <verse number="29">So is he who sleeps with another man’s wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Men do not despise the thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Yet if caught, he must pay sevenfold; he must give up all the wealth of his house.</verse>
  <verse number="32">He who commits adultery lacks judgment; whoever does so destroys himself.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Wounds and dishonor will befall him, and his reproach will never be wiped away.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For jealousy enrages a husband, and he will show no mercy in the day of vengeance.</verse>
  <verse number="35">He will not be appeased by any ransom, or persuaded by lavish gifts.</verse>
