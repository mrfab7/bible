<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widowâ€™s ox for a pledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yields food for them and for their children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded cries out: yet God lays not folly to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The murderer rising with the light kills the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The eye also of the adulterer waits for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguises his face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholds not the way of the vineyards.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so does the grave those which have sinned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He evil entreats the barren that bears not: and does not good to the widow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He draws also the mighty with his power: he rises up, and no man is sure of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Though it be given him to be in safety, where on he rests; yet his eyes are on their ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?</p>
