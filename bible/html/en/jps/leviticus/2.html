<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And when any one bringeth a meal-offering unto the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests; and he shall take thereout his handful of the fine flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, together with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall make the memorial-part thereof smoke upon the altar, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And when thou bringest a meal-offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And if thy offering be a meal-offering baked on a griddle, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thou shalt break it in pieces, and pour oil thereon; it is a meal-offering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And if thy offering be a meal-offering of the stewing-pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And thou shalt bring the meal-offering that is made of these things unto the LORD; and it shall be presented unto the priest, and he shall bring it unto the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the priest shall take off from the meal-offering the memorial-part thereof, and shall make it smoke upon the altar—an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But that which is left of the meal-offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">No meal-offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven; for ye shall make no leaven, nor any honey, smoke as an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">As an offering of first-fruits ye may bring them unto the LORD; but they shall not come up for a sweet savour on the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And every meal-offering of thine shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meal-offering; with all thy offerings thou shalt offer salt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And if thou bring a meal-offering of first-fruits unto the LORD, thou shalt bring for the meal-offering of thy first-fruits corn in the ear parched with fire, even groats of the fresh ear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon; it is a meal-offering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the priest shall make the memorial-part of it smoke, even of the groats thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
