<chapter book="Ephesians" number="4" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">I therefore, the prisoner in the Lord, beseech you to walk worthily of the calling wherewith ye were called,</verse>
  <verse number="2">with all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;</verse>
  <verse number="3">giving diligence to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</verse>
  <verse number="4">There is one body, and one Spirit, even as also ye were called in one hope of your calling;</verse>
  <verse number="5">one Lord, one faith, one baptism,</verse>
  <verse number="6">one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through all, and in all.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But unto each one of us was the grace given according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Wherefore he saith, When he ascended on high, he led captivity captive, And gave gifts unto men.</verse>
  <verse number="9">(Now this, He ascended, what is it but that he also descended into the lower parts of the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="10">He that descended is the same also that ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.)</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he gave some to be apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;</verse>
  <verse number="12">for the perfecting of the saints, unto the work of ministering, unto the building up of the body of Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="13">till we all attain unto the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a fullgrown man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="14">that we may be no longer children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error;</verse>
  <verse number="15">but speaking truth in love, may grow up in all things into him, who is the head, even Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="16">from whom all the body fitly framed and knit together through that which every joint supplieth, according to the working in due measure of each several part, maketh the increase of the body unto the building up of itself in love.</verse>
  <verse number="17">This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of their mind,</verse>
  <verse number="18">being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardening of their heart;</verse>
  <verse number="19">who being past feeling gave themselves up to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But ye did not so learn Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="21">if so be that ye heard him, and were taught in him, even as truth is in Jesus:</verse>
  <verse number="22">that ye put away, as concerning your former manner of life, the old man, that waxeth corrupt after the lusts of deceit;</verse>
  <verse number="23">and that ye be renewed in the spirit of your mind,</verse>
  <verse number="24">and put on the new man, that after God hath been created in righteousness and holiness of truth.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Wherefore, putting away falsehood, speak ye truth each one with his neighbor: for we are members one of another.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:</verse>
  <verse number="27">neither give place to the devil.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may have whereof to give to him that hath need.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is good for edifying as the need may be, that it may give grace to them that hear.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, in whom ye were sealed unto the day of redemption.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and railing, be put away from you, with all malice:</verse>
  <verse number="32">and be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other, even as God also in Christ forgave you.</verse>
