  <verse number="1">And the LORD said to Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father’s house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined to thee, and minister to thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they shall be joined to thee, and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh to you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest’s office for every thing of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall serve: I have given your priest’s office to you as a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; to thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="9">This shall be thine of the most holy things reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render to me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.</verse>
  <verse number="10">In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And this is thine; the heave-offering of their gift, with all the wave-offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them to thee, and to thy sons, and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the first-fruits of them which they shall offer to the LORD, them have I given to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And whatever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring to the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring to the LORD, whether of men or beast, shall be thine: nevertheless, the first born of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou redeem, according to thy estimation, for the money of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savor to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave-breast and as the right shoulder are thine</verse>
  <verse number="19">All the heave-offerings of the holy things, which the children of Israel offer to the LORD, have I given to thee, and to thy sons and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt for ever before the LORD to thee and to thy seed with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part and thy inheritance among the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: It shall be a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as a heave-offering to the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said to them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="26">Thus speak to the Levites, and say to them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up a heave-offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the tithe.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And this your heave-offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it were the corn of the threshing-floor, and as the fullness of the wine-press.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Thus ye also shall offer a heave-offering to the LORD of all your tithes which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give of them the LORD’S heave-offering to Aaron the priest.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave-offering of the LORD, of all the best of it, even its hallowed part out of it.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Therefore thou shalt say to them, When ye have heaved from it the best of it, then it shall be counted to the Levites as the increase of the threshing-floor, and as the increase of the wine-press.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.</verse>
