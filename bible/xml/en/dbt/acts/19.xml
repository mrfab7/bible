  <verse number="1">And it came to pass, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper districts, came to Ephesus, and finding certain disciples,</verse>
  <verse number="2">he said to them, Did ye receive [the] Holy Spirit when ye had believed? And they [said] to him, We did not even hear if [the] Holy Spirit was [come].</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he said, To what then were ye baptised? And they said, To the baptism of John.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Paul said, John indeed baptised [with] the baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on him that was coming after him, that is, on Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And when they heard that, they were baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Paul having laid [his] hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And all the men were about twelve.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And entering into the synagogue, he spoke boldly during three months, reasoning and persuading [the things] concerning the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But when some were hardened and disbelieved, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, he left them and separated the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And this took place for two years, so that all that inhabited Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And God wrought no ordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,</verse>
  <verse number="12">so that even napkins or aprons were brought from his body [and put] upon the sick, and the diseases left them, and the wicked spirits went out.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And certain of the Jewish exorcists also, who went about, took in hand to call upon those who had wicked spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preaches.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And there were certain [men], seven sons of Sceva, Jewish high priest, who were doing this.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But the wicked spirit answering said to them, Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with; but ye, who are ye?</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the man in whom the wicked spirit was leaped upon them, and having mastered both, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who inhabited Ephesus, and fear fell upon all of them, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And many of those that believed came confessing and declaring their deeds.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And many of those that practised curious arts brought their books [of charms] and burnt them before all. And they reckoned up the prices of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Thus with might the word of the Lord increased and prevailed.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And when these things were fulfilled, Paul purposed in his spirit to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, After I have been there I must see Rome also.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And having sent into Macedonia two of those ministering to him, Timotheus and Erastus, he remained himself awhile in Asia.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And there took place at that time no small disturbance about the way.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For a certain [man] by name Demetrius, a silver-beater, making silver temples of Artemis, brought no small gain to the artisans;</verse>
  <verse number="25">whom having brought together, and those who wrought in such things, he said, Men, ye know that our well-living arises from this work,</verse>
  <verse number="26">and ye see and hear that this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great crowd, not only of Ephesus, but almost of all Asia, saying that they are no gods which are made with hands.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Now not only there is danger for us that our business come into discredit, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis be counted for nothing, and that her greatness should be destroyed whom the whole of Asia and the world reveres.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And having heard [this], and being filled with rage, they cried out, saying, Great [is] Artemis of the Ephesians.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And the [whole] city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one accord to the theatre, having seized and carried off with [them] Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, fellow-travellers of Paul.</verse>
  <verse number="30">But Paul intending to go in to the people, the disciples suffered him not;</verse>
  <verse number="31">and some of the Asiarchs also, who were his friends, sent to him and urged him not to throw himself into the theatre.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Different persons therefore cried out some different thing; for the assembly was tumultuous, and the most did not know for what cause they had come together.</verse>
  <verse number="33">But from among the crowd they put forward Alexander, the Jews pushing him forward. And Alexander, beckoning with his hand, would have made a defence to the people.</verse>
  <verse number="34">But, recognising that he was a Jew, there was one cry from all, shouting for about two hours, Great [is] Artemis of the Ephesians.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the townclerk, having quieted the crowd, said, Ephesians, what man is there then who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of Artemis the great, and of the [image] which fell down from heaven?</verse>
  <verse number="36">These things therefore being undeniable, it is necessary that ye should be calm and do nothing headlong.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For ye have brought these men, [who are] neither temple-plunderers, nor speak injuriously of your goddess.</verse>
  <verse number="38">If therefore Demetrius and the artisans who [are] with him have a matter against any one, the courts are being held, and there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another.</verse>
  <verse number="39">But if ye inquire anything concerning other matters, it will be settled in the regular assembly.</verse>
  <verse number="40">For also we are in danger to be put in accusation for sedition for this [affair] of to-day, no cause existing in reference to which we shall be able to give a reason for this concourse.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And having said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</verse>
