<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">No doubt but you are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yes, who knows not such things as these?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I am as one mocked of his neighbor, who calls on God, and he answers him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God brings abundantly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach you; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach you: and the fishes of the sea shall declare to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who knows not in all these that the hand of the LORD has worked this?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Does not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">With him is wisdom and strength, he has counsel and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Behold, he breaks down, and it cannot be built again: he shuts up a man, and there can be no opening.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up: also he sends them out, and they overturn the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He leads counsellors away spoiled, and makes the judges fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He looses the bond of kings, and girds their loins with a girdle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He leads princes away spoiled, and overthrows the mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He removes away the speech of the trusty, and takes away the understanding of the aged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He pours contempt on princes, and weakens the strength of the mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He discovers deep things out of darkness, and brings out to light the shadow of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He increases the nations, and destroys them: he enlarges the nations, and straitens them again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He takes away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">They grope in the dark without light, and he makes them to stagger like a drunken man.</p>
