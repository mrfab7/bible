<chapter book="Isaiah" number="32" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Behold, a king will reign in righteousness, and princes will rule with justice.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Each will be like a shelter from the wind, a refuge from the storm, like streams of water in a dry land, like the shadow of a great rock in an arid land.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed, and the ears of those who hear will listen.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The mind of the rash will know and understand, and the stammering tongue will speak clearly and fluently.</verse>
  <verse number="5">No longer will a fool be called noble, nor a scoundrel be respected.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For a fool speaks foolishness; his mind plots iniquity. He practices ungodliness and speaks falsely about the LORD; he leaves the hungry empty and deprives the thirsty of drink.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The weapons of the scoundrel are destructive; he hatches plots to destroy the poor with lies, even when the plea of the needy is just.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But a noble man makes honorable plans; he stands up for worthy causes.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Stand up, you complacent women; listen to me. Give ear to my word, you overconfident daughters.</verse>
  <verse number="10">In a little more than a year you will tremble, O secure ones. For the grape harvest will fail and the fruit harvest will not arrive.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Shudder, you ladies of leisure; tremble, you daughters of complacency. Strip yourselves bare and put sackcloth around your waists.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vines,</verse>
  <verse number="13">and for the land of my people, overgrown with thorns and briers—even for every house of merriment in this city of revelry.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For the palace will be forsaken, the busy city abandoned. The hill and the watchtower will become caves forever—the delight of wild donkeys and a pasture for flocks—</verse>
  <verse number="15">until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high. Then the desert will be an orchard, and the orchard will seem like a forest.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then justice will inhabit the wilderness, and righteousness will dwell in the fertile field.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The work of righteousness will be peace; the service of righteousness will be quiet confidence forever.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Then my people will dwell in a peaceful place, in safe and secure places of rest.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But hail will level the forest, and the city will sink to the depths.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Blessed are those who sow beside abundant waters, who let the ox and donkey range freely.</verse>
