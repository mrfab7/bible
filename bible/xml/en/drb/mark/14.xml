  <verse number="1">NOW the feast of the pasch, and of the Azymes was after two days; and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might by some wile lay hold on him, and kill him.</verse>
  <verse number="2">But they said: Not on the festival day, lest there should be a tumult among the people.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And when he was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper, and was at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of precious spikenard: and breaking the alabaster box, she poured it out upon his head.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Now there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said: Why was this waste of the ointment made?</verse>
  <verse number="5">For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But Jesus said: Let her alone, why do you molest her? She hath wrought a good work upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For the poor you have always with you: and whensoever you will, you may do them good: but me you have not always.</verse>
  <verse number="8">She hath done what she could: she is come beforehand to anoint my body for burial.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Amen, I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memorial of her.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests, to betray him to them.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Who hearing it were glad; and they promised him they would give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now on the first day of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the pasch, the disciples say to him: Whither wilt thou that we go, and prepare for thee to eat the pasch?</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith to them: Go ye into the city; and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water, follow him;</verse>
  <verse number="14">And whithersoever he shall go in, say to the master of the house, The master saith, Where is my refectory, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples?</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he will shew you a large dining room furnished; and there prepare ye for us.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And his disciples went their way, and came into the city; and they found as he had told them, and they prepared the pasch.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And when evening was come, he cometh with the twelve.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And when they were at table and eating, Jesus saith: Amen I say to you, one of you that eateth with me shall betray me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one: Is it I?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Who saith to them: One of the twelve, who dippeth with me his hand in the dish.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were better for him, if that man had not been born.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And whilst they were eating, Jesus took bread; and blessing, broke, and gave to them, and said: Take ye. This is my body.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And having taken the chalice, giving thanks, he gave it to them. And they all drank of it.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And he said to them: This is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Amen I say to you, that I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And when they had said an hymn, they went forth to the mount of Olives.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And Jesus saith to them: You will all be scandalized in my regard this night; for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep shall be dispersed.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="29">But Peter saith to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, yet not I.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And Jesus saith to him: Amen I say to thee, to day, even in this night, before the cock crow twice, thou shall deny me thrice.</verse>
  <verse number="31">But he spoke the more vehemently: Although I should die together with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And they came to a farm called Gethsemani. And he saith to his disciples: Sit you here, while I pray.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And he taketh Peter and James and John with him; and he began to fear and to be heavy.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death; stay you here, and watch.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And when he was gone forward a little, he fell flat on the ground; and he prayed, that if it might be, the hour might pass from him.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And he saith: Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee: remove this chalice from me; but not what I will, but what thou wilt.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping. And he saith to Peter: Simon, sleepest thou? couldst thou not watch one hour?</verse>
  <verse number="38">Watch ye, and pray that you enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</verse>
  <verse number="39">A going away again, he prayed, saying the same words.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And when he returned, he found them again asleep, (for their eyes were heavy,) and they knew not what to answer him.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And he cometh the third time, and saith to them: Sleep ye now, and take your rest. It is enough: the hour is come: behold the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
  <verse number="42">Rise up, let us go. Behold, he that will betray me is at hand.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And while he was yet speaking, cometh Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve: and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the ancients.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And he that betrayed him, had given them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he; lay hold on him, and lead him away carefully.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And when he was come, immediately going up to him, he saith: Hail, Rabbi; and he kissed him.</verse>
  <verse number="46">But they laid hands on him, and held him.</verse>
  <verse number="47">An one of them that stood by, drawing a sword, struck a servant of the chief priest, and cut off his ear.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And Jesus answering, said to them: Are you come out as to a robber, with swords and staves to apprehend me?</verse>
  <verse number="49">I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you did not lay hands on me. But that the scriptures may be fulfilled.</verse>
  <verse number="50">Then his disciples leaving him, all fled away.</verse>
  <verse number="51">And a certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth cast about his naked body; and they laid hold on him.</verse>
  <verse number="52">But he, casting off the linen cloth, fled from them naked.</verse>
  <verse number="53">And they brought Jesus to the high priest; and all the priests and the scribes and the ancients assembled together.</verse>
  <verse number="54">And Peter followed him from afar off, even into the court of the high priest; and he sat with the servants at the fire, and warmed himself.</verse>
  <verse number="55">And the chief priests and all the council sought for evidence against Jesus, that they might put him to death, and found none.</verse>
  <verse number="56">For many bore false witness against him, and their evidences were not agreeing.</verse>
  <verse number="57">And some rising up, bore false witness against him, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="58">We heard him say, I will destroy this temple made with hands, and within three days I will build another not made with hands.</verse>
  <verse number="59">And their witness did not agree.</verse>
  <verse number="60">And the high priest rising up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying: Answerest thou nothing to the things that are laid to thy charge by these men?</verse>
  <verse number="61">But he held his peace, and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him, and said to him: Art thou the Christ the Son of the blessed God?</verse>
  <verse number="62">And Jesus said to him: I am. And you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming with the clouds of heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="63">Then the high priest rending his garments, saith: What need we any further witnesses?</verse>
  <verse number="64">You have heard the blasphemy. What think you? Who all condemned him to be guilty of death.</verse>
  <verse number="65">And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say unto him: Prophesy: and the servants struck him with the palms of their hands.</verse>
  <verse number="66">Now when Peter was in the court below, there cometh one of the maidservants of the high priest.</verse>
  <verse number="67">And when she had seen Peter warming himself, looking on him she saith: Thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.</verse>
  <verse number="68">But he denied, saying: I neither know nor understand what thou sayest. And he went forth before the court; and the cock crew.</verse>
  <verse number="69">And again a maidservant seeing him, began to say to the standers by: This is one of them.</verse>
  <verse number="70">But he denied again. And after a while they that stood by said again to Peter: Surely thou art one of them; for thou art also a Galilean.</verse>
  <verse number="71">But he began to curse and to swear, saying; I know not this man of whom you speak.</verse>
  <verse number="72">And immediately the cock crew again. And Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said unto him: Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny me. And he began to weep.</verse>
