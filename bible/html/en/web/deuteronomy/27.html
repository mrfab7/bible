<p class="verse" data-verse="2">It shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan to the land which Yahweh your God gives you, that you shall set yourself up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and you shall write on them all the words of this law, when you have passed over; that you may go in to the land which Yahweh your God gives you, a land flowing with milk and honey, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">It shall be, when you have passed over the Jordan, that you shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in Mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="6">You shall build the altar of Yahweh your God of uncut stones; and you shall offer burnt offerings thereon to Yahweh your God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and you shall sacrifice peace offerings, and shall eat there; and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">You shall write on the stones all the words of this law very plainly.”</p>
