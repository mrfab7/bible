<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Hannah prayed, and said: My heart exulteth in the LORD, My horn is exalted in the LORD; My mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; Because I rejoice in Thy salvation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">There is none holy as the LORD, For there is none beside Thee; Neither is there any rock like our God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Multiply not exceeding proud talk; Let not arrogancy come out of your mouth; For the LORD is a God of knowledge, And by Him actions are weighed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The bows of the mighty men are broken, And they that stumbled are girded with strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; And they that were hungry have ceased; While the barren hath borne seven, She that had many children hath languished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The LORD killeth, and maketh alive; He bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich; He bringeth low, He also lifteth up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, He lifteth up the needy from the dung-hill, To make them sit with princes, And inherit the throne of glory; For the pillars of the earth are the LORD’S, And He hath set the world upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He will keep the feet of His holy ones, But the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; For not by strength shall man prevail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They that strive with the LORD shall be broken to pieces; Against them will He thunder in heaven; The LORD will judge the ends of the earth; And He will give strength unto His king, And exalt the horn of His anointed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his band;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did unto all the Israelites that came thither in Shiloh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Yea, before the fat was made to smoke, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed: ‘Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And if the man said unto him: ‘Let the fat be made to smoke first of all, and then take as much as thy soul desireth’; then he would say: ‘Nay, but thou shalt give it me now; and if not, I will take it by force.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD; for the men dealt contemptuously with the offering of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say: ‘The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which was lent to the LORD.’ And they would go unto their own home.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">So the LORD remembered Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he said unto them: ‘Why do ye such things? for I hear evil reports concerning you from all this people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Nay, my sons; for it is no good report which I hear the LORD’S people do spread abroad.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If one man sin against another, God shall judge him; but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him?’ But they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him: ‘Thus saith the LORD: Did I reveal Myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to go up unto Mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before Me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Wherefore kick ye at My sacrifice and at Mine offering, which I have commanded in My habitation; and honourest thy sons above Me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel My people?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, saith: I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before Me for ever; but now the LORD saith: Be it far from Me: for them that honour Me I will honour, and they that despise Me shall be lightly esteemed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And thou shalt behold a rival in My habitation, in all the good which shall be done to Israel; and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Yet will I not cut off every man of thine from Mine altar, to make thine eyes to fail, and thy heart to languish; and all the increase of thy house shall die young men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And this shall be the sign unto thee, that which shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall die both of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And I will raise Me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in My heart and in My mind; and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before Mine anointed for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say: Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.’</p>
