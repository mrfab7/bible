<chapter book="Job" number="29" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Job again took up his parable, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Oh that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me;</verse>
  <verse number="3">when his lamp shone on my head, and by his light I walked through darkness,</verse>
  <verse number="4">as I was in the ripeness of my days, when the friendship of God was in my tent,</verse>
  <verse number="5">when the Almighty was yet with me, and my children were around me,</verse>
  <verse number="6">when my steps were washed with butter, and the rock poured out streams of oil for me,</verse>
  <verse number="7">when I went forth to the city gate, when I prepared my seat in the street.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The young men saw me and hid themselves. The aged rose up and stood.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The princes refrained from talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For when the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it commended me:</verse>
  <verse number="12">Because I delivered the poor who cried, and the fatherless also, who had none to help him,</verse>
  <verse number="13">the blessing of him who was ready to perish came on me, and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I put on righteousness, and it clothed me. My justice was as a robe and a diadem.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I was eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I was a father to the needy. The cause of him who I didn’t know, I searched out.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I broke the jaws of the unrighteous, and plucked the prey out of his teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Then I said, ‘I shall die in my own house, I shall number my days as the sand.</verse>
  <verse number="19">My root is spread out to the waters. The dew lies all night on my branch.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My glory is fresh in me. My bow is renewed in my hand.’</verse>
  <verse number="21">“Men listened to me, waited, and kept silence for my counsel.</verse>
  <verse number="22">After my words they didn’t speak again. My speech fell on them.</verse>
  <verse number="23">They waited for me as for the rain. Their mouths drank as with the spring rain.</verse>
  <verse number="24">I smiled on them when they had no confidence. They didn’t reject the light of my face.</verse>
  <verse number="25">I chose out their way, and sat as chief. I lived as a king in the army, as one who comforts the mourners.</verse>
