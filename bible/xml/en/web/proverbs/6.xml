<chapter book="Proverbs" number="6" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My son, if you have become collateral for your neighbor, if you have struck your hands in pledge for a stranger;</verse>
  <verse number="2">You are trapped by the words of your mouth. You are ensnared with the words of your mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Do this now, my son, and deliver yourself, since you have come into the hand of your neighbor. Go, humble yourself. Press your plea with your neighbor.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Give no sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Free yourself, like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the snare of the fowler.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Go to the ant, you sluggard. Consider her ways, and be wise;</verse>
  <verse number="7">which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,</verse>
  <verse number="8">provides her bread in the summer, and gathers her food in the harvest.</verse>
  <verse number="9">How long will you sleep, sluggard? When will you arise out of your sleep?</verse>
  <verse number="10">A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</verse>
  <verse number="11">so your poverty will come as a robber, and your scarcity as an armed man.</verse>
  <verse number="12">A worthless person, a man of iniquity, is he who walks with a perverse mouth;</verse>
  <verse number="13">who winks with his eyes, who signals with his feet, who motions with his fingers;</verse>
  <verse number="14">in whose heart is perverseness, who devises evil continually, who always sows discord.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Therefore his calamity will come suddenly. He will be broken suddenly, and that without remedy.</verse>
  <verse number="16">There are six things which Yahweh hates; yes, seven which are an abomination to him:</verse>
  <verse number="17">haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood;</verse>
  <verse number="18">a heart that devises wicked schemes, feet that are swift in running to mischief,</verse>
  <verse number="19">a false witness who utters lies, and he who sows discord among brothers.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My son, keep your father’s commandment, and don’t forsake your mother’s teaching.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Bind them continually on your heart. Tie them around your neck.</verse>
  <verse number="22">When you walk, it will lead you. When you sleep, it will watch over you. When you awake, it will talk with you.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For the commandment is a lamp, and the law is light. Reproofs of instruction are the way of life,</verse>
  <verse number="24">to keep you from the immoral woman, from the flattery of the wayward wife’s tongue.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Don’t lust after her beauty in your heart, neither let her captivate you with her eyelids.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For a prostitute reduces you to a piece of bread. The adulteress hunts for your precious life.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Can a man scoop fire into his lap, and his clothes not be burned?</verse>
  <verse number="28">Or can one walk on hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?</verse>
  <verse number="29">So is he who goes in to his neighbor’s wife. Whoever touches her will not be unpunished.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Men don’t despise a thief, if he steals to satisfy himself when he is hungry:</verse>
  <verse number="31">but if he is found, he shall restore seven times. He shall give all the wealth of his house.</verse>
  <verse number="32">He who commits adultery with a woman is void of understanding. He who does it destroys his own soul.</verse>
  <verse number="33">He will get wounds and dishonor. His reproach will not be wiped away.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For jealousy arouses the fury of the husband. He won’t spare in the day of vengeance.</verse>
  <verse number="35">He won’t regard any ransom, neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.</verse>
