<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="19" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Better is the poor that walks in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hastens with his feet sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The foolishness of man perverts his way: and his heart frets against the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Wealth makes many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaks lies shall not escape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Many will entreat the favor of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that gives gifts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All the brothers of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursues them with words, yet they are wanting to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that gets wisdom loves his own soul: he that keeps understanding shall find good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaks lies shall perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The discretion of a man defers his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favor is as dew on the grass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He that keeps the commandment keeps his own soul; but he that despises his ways shall die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He that has pity on the poor lends to the LORD; and that which he has given will he pay him again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Chasten your son while there is hope, and let not your soul spare for his crying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if you deliver him, yet you must do it again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that you may be wise in your latter end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">There are many devices in a man’s heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The fear of the LORD tends to life: and he that has it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">A slothful man hides his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that has understanding, and he will understand knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He that wastes his father, and chases away his mother, is a son that causes shame, and brings reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causes to err from the words of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">An ungodly witness scorns judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.</p>
