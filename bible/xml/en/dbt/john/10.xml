<chapter book="John" number="10" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Verily, verily, I say to you, He that enters not in by the door to the fold of the sheep, but mounts up elsewhere, he is a thief and a robber;</verse>
  <verse number="2">but he that enters in by the door is [the] shepherd of the sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="3">To him the porter opens; and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.</verse>
  <verse number="4">When he has put forth all his own, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But they will not follow a stranger, but will flee from him, because they know not the voice of strangers.</verse>
  <verse number="6">This allegory spoke Jesus to them, but they did not know what it was [of] which he spoke to them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Jesus therefore said again to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="8">All whoever came before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I am the door: if any one enter in by me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and shall go out and shall find pasture.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The thief comes not but that he may steal, and kill, and destroy: I am come that they might have life, and might have [it] abundantly.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep:</verse>
  <verse number="12">but he who serves for wages, and who is not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf seizes them and scatters the sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Now he who serves for wages flees because he serves for wages, and is not himself concerned about the sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I am the good shepherd; and I know those that are mine, and am known of those that are mine,</verse>
  <verse number="15">as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And I have other sheep which are not of this fold: those also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.</verse>
  <verse number="17">On this account the Father loves me, because I lay down my life that I may take it again.</verse>
  <verse number="18">No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have authority to lay it down and I have authority to take it again. I have received this commandment of my Father.</verse>
  <verse number="19">There was a division again among the Jews on account of these words;</verse>
  <verse number="20">but many of them said, He has a demon and raves; why do ye hear him?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Others said, These sayings are not [those] of one that is possessed by a demon. Can a demon open blind people’s eyes?</verse>
  <verse number="22">Now the feast of the dedication was celebrating at Jerusalem, and it was winter.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Jesus walked in the temple in the porch of Solomon.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The Jews therefore surrounded him, and said to him, Until when dost thou hold our soul in suspense? If thou art the Christ, say [so] to us openly.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye do not believe. The works which I do in my Father’s name, these bear witness concerning me:</verse>
  <verse number="26">but ye do not believe, for ye are not of my sheep, as I told you.</verse>
  <verse number="27">My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me;</verse>
  <verse number="28">and I give them life eternal; and they shall never perish, and no one shall seize them out of my hand.</verse>
  <verse number="29">My Father who has given [them] to me is greater than all, and no one can seize out of the hand of my Father.</verse>
  <verse number="30">I and the Father are one.</verse>
  <verse number="31">The Jews therefore again took stones that they might stone him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewn you of my Father; for which work of them do ye stone me?</verse>
  <verse number="33">The Jews answered him, For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy, and because thou, being a man, makest thyself God.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?</verse>
  <verse number="35">If he called them gods to whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),</verse>
  <verse number="36">do ye say of him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am Son of God?</verse>
  <verse number="37">If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not;</verse>
  <verse number="38">but if I do, even if ye believe not me, believe the works, that ye may know [and believe] that the Father is in me and I in him.</verse>
  <verse number="39">They sought therefore again to take him; and he went away from out of their hand</verse>
  <verse number="40">and departed again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was baptising at the first: and he abode there.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And many came to him, and said, John did no sign; but all things which John said of this [man] were true.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And many believed on him there.</verse>
