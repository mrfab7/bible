<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then after fourteen years, again went I up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, having taken together Titus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And I went up according to revelation, and placed before them the good news which I proclaim in the nations, but apart to them highly esteemed, lest I run in vain, or ran.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But neither Titus, with me, being a Greek, was forced to be circumcised:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And through false brethren introduced privately, who came in privately to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might reduce us to slavery:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">To whom we yielded in subjection, not for an hour; that the truth of the good news might remain with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And from them seeming to be something, (whatever they were, it concerns me nothing: God receives not manâ€™s face:) for they seeming entrusted nothing to me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But on the contrary, having seen that I have been entrusted with the good news of uncircumcision, as Peter of circumcision;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">(For be having been energetic in Peter for the mission of circumcision, was energetic also in me for the nations:)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And having known the grace given to me, James, and Cephas, and John, seeming to be pillars, gave me and Barnabas the right hands of communion; that we for the nations, and they for the circumcision.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Only that we remember the poor; and this same was I forward to do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to the face, for he was to be rebuked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For before certain came from James, he ate with the nations: and when they came, he drew down, and separated himself, being afraid of them of the circumcision.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the rest of the Jews also dissembled with him; so that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But when I saw that they went not upon the strait road according to the truth of the good news, I said to Peter before all, If thou, being a Jew, livest according to the nations, and not according to the Jews, why forcest thou the nations to live as the Jews?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">We by nature Jews, and not sinners from the nations,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Knowing that a man is not justified from the works of the law, but through faith of Jesus Christ, and we believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified from the faith of Christ, and not from the works of the law: therefore from the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And it; seeking to be justified in Christ, we were found also ourselves sinners, is Christ therefore the servant of sin? It may not be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For if what I destroy, these I build again, I unite myself with the transgressor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For I through the law died to the law, that. I might live to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I am crucified with Christ: and I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in we: and what I now live in the flesh I live in the faith of the Son of God, having loved me, and given himself for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">I put not away the grace of God for if justice through the law, Christ died in vain.</p>
