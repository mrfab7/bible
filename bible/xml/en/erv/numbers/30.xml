  <verse number="1">And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded.</verse>
  <verse number="2">When a man voweth a vow unto the LORD, or sweareth an oath to bind his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Also when a woman voweth a vow unto the LORD, and bindeth herself by a bond, being in her father’s house, in her youth;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and her father heareth her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father holdeth his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; none of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And if she be married to a husband, while her vows are upon her, or the rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul;</verse>
  <verse number="7">and her husband hear it, and hold his peace at her in the day that he heareth it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But if her husband disallow her in the day that he heareth it; then he shall make void her vow which is upon her, and the rash utterance of her lips, wherewith she hath bound her soul: and the LORD shall forgive her.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But the vow of a widow, or of her that is divorced, even every thing wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand against her.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And if she vowed in her husband’s house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath,</verse>
  <verse number="11">and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not; then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he hath established them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But if he shall make them null and void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="16">These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter, being in her youth, in her father’s house.</verse>
