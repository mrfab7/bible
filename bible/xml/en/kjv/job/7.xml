<chapter book="Job" number="7" translation="King James Bible" translationID="kjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">[Is there] not an appointed time to man upon earth? [are not] his days also like the days of an hireling?</verse>
  <verse number="2">As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for [the reward of] his work:</verse>
  <verse number="3">So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</verse>
  <verse number="5">My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.</verse>
  <verse number="6">My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope.</verse>
  <verse number="7">O remember that my life [is] wind: mine eye shall no more see good.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no [more]: thine eyes [are] upon me, and I [am] not.</verse>
  <verse number="9">[As] the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no [more].</verse>
  <verse number="10">He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
  <verse number="12">[Am] I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?</verse>
  <verse number="13">When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:</verse>
  <verse number="15">So that my soul chooseth strangling, [and] death rather than my life.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I loathe [it]; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days [are] vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="17">What [is] man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And [that] thou shouldest visit him every morning, [and] try him every moment?</verse>
  <verse number="19">How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</verse>
  <verse number="20">I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?</verse>
  <verse number="21">And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I [shall] not [be].</verse>
