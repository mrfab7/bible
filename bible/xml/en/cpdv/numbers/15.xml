  <verse number="1">The Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Speak to the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them: When you will have entered into the land of your habitation, which I will give you,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and you make an offering to the Lord, as a holocaust or as a victim, paying your vows, or as a voluntary offering of gifts, or in your solemnities, burning a sweet odor to the Lord, whether from the oxen or from the sheep:</verse>
  <verse number="4">whoever immolates the victim shall offer a sacrifice of fine wheat flour, the tenth part of an ephah, sprinkled with oil, which shall have the measure of the fourth part of a hin,</verse>
  <verse number="5">and he shall give the same measure of wine, poured out as libations, whether as a holocaust or as a victim.</verse>
  <verse number="6">With each lamb and each ram, there shall be a sacrifice of fine wheat flour, of two tenths, which shall be sprinkled with one third part of a hin of oil.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he shall offer the same measure, one third part of wine, for the libation, as a sweet odor to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Yet truly, when you will offer, from the oxen, a holocaust or a victim, in order to fulfill your vow or for peace-offering victims,</verse>
  <verse number="9">you shall give, for each ox, three tenths of fine wheat flour, sprinkled with oil, which has the measure of one half of one hin,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and the wine, poured out as libations, shall be of the same measure, as an oblation of most sweet odor to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="11">So shall you do</verse>
  <verse number="12">for each ox, and ram, and lamb, and young goat.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Both natives and sojourners</verse>
  <verse number="14">shall offer sacrifices by the same rituals.</verse>
  <verse number="15">There shall be one precept and one judgment, as much for yourselves as for newcomers to the land.”</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="17">“Speak to the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them:</verse>
  <verse number="18">When you will arrive in the land which I will give to you,</verse>
  <verse number="19">and when you will eat from the bread of that region, you shall separate the first-fruits to the Lord</verse>
  <verse number="20">from the foods that you eat. Just as you separate the first-fruits of your threshing floors,</verse>
  <verse number="21">so also shall you give the first-fruits of your cooked grains to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And if, through ignorance, you neglect any of these things, which the Lord has spoken to Moses,</verse>
  <verse number="23">and which he has commanded through him for you, from the day that he began to command and thereafter,</verse>
  <verse number="24">and if the multitude will have forgotten to do it, then they shall offer a calf from the herd, a holocaust as a most sweet odor to the Lord, and its sacrifice and libations, just as the ceremonies ask, and a he-goat for sin.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the priest shall pray for the entire multitude of the sons of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them, because they did not sin willfully. Nevertheless, they shall offer incense to the Lord for themselves, and for sin, as well as for their error.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And it shall be forgiven all the people of the sons of Israel, as well as the newcomers who sojourn among them, for it is the culpability of all the people through neglect.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But if one soul will have sinned by not knowing, he shall offer a one-year-old she-goat for his sin.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the priest shall pray for him, because he sinned unknowingly before the Lord. And he shall obtain pardon for him, and it will be forgiven him.</verse>
  <verse number="29">One law shall be for all who sin by ignorance, as much for natives as for newcomers.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Yet truly, the soul who commits any of these acts through arrogance, whether he is a citizen or a sojourner, because he has rebelled against the Lord, shall perish from among his people.</verse>
  <verse number="31">For he has despised the word of the Lord, and he has nullified his precept. For this reason, he shall be destroyed, and he shall bear his iniquity.”</verse>
  <verse number="32">And it happened that, when the sons of Israel were in the wilderness, and they had found a man collecting wood on the day of the Sabbath,</verse>
  <verse number="33">they brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to the whole multitude.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And they enclosed him in a prison, not knowing what they should do with him.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the Lord said to Moses, “Let that man be put to death; let the entire crowd crush him with stones, outside the camp.”</verse>
  <verse number="36">And when they had led him out, they overwhelmed him with stones, and he died, just as the Lord had instructed.</verse>
  <verse number="37">The Lord also said to Moses:</verse>
  <verse number="38">“Speak to the sons of Israel, and you shall tell them to make for themselves hems at the corners of their cloaks, placing in them ribbons of hyacinth,</verse>
  <verse number="39">so that, when they see these, they may remember all the commandments of the Lord, and they may not follow their own thoughts and eyes, fornicating in various ways,</verse>
  <verse number="40">but instead, they, being more mindful of the precepts of the Lord, may do them and may be holy to their God.</verse>
  <verse number="41">I am the Lord your God, who led you away from the land of Egypt, so that I may be your God.”</verse>
