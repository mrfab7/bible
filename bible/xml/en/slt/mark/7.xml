  <verse number="1">And the Pharisees are gathered together to him, and certain of the scribes, having come from Jerusalem,</verse>
  <verse number="2">And having seen some of his disciples with common hands, that is, unwashed, eating loaves, they rebuked.</verse>
  <verse number="3">(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they vigorously wash hands, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And from the market-place, except they be immersed, they eat not. And there are many other things which they received to hold; the immersion of cups, and of measures, and of brazen vases, and of chairs.)</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Wherefore do not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he having answered, said to them, That Esaias prophesied well concerning you, as it has been written, This people honour me with lips, and their heart keeps far from me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And in vain they revere me, teaching doctrines the commands of men.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For having left the command of God, ye hold firmly to the tradition of men, the immersion of measures and cups: and many other such like things ye do.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he said to them, Well do ye abrogate the command of God, that ye might keep your tradition.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and he reviling father or mother, in death let him die:</verse>
  <verse number="11">And ye say, If a man say to father or mother, Corban, which is, a gift, whatever thou be profited by me;</verse>
  <verse number="12">And ye permit him to do nothing more for his father or his mother.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Abrogating the word of God by your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things ye do.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And having called all the crowd, he said to them, Hear me, all ye, and do ye understand:</verse>
  <verse number="15">There is nothing from without a man, entering into him, which can defile him: but things coming out from him, these are the things polluting the man.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If any have ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And when he came into the house from the crowd, his disciples asked him of the parable.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he says, So are ye also without understanding? Do ye not perceive, that anything from without entering into a man, cannot pollute him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For it goes not into the heart, but into the belly, and goes forth into the privy, purging all food.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he said, That going out of a man, that pollutes a man.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For within, out of the heart of men, go forth evil reflections, adulteries, fornications, murders,</verse>
  <verse number="22">Thefts, overreaching, deceit, licentiousness, an evil eye, defamation, pride, foolishness:</verse>
  <verse number="23">All these evils go out from within, and pollute a man.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And arising from thence, he departed into the bounds of Tyre and Sidon, and having come into the house, he would have none know; and he could not be hid.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For a woman having heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, having come, fell at his feet:</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the woman was a Grecian, a Syrophenician by birth; and she entreated him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And Jesus said to her, Permit the children first to be satisfied; for it is not good to take the children’s bread, and cast to little dogs.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And she answered and says to him, Yes, Lord: for also the little dogs under the table eat from the children’s crumbs.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he said to her, For this word retire; the demon has gone out of thy daughter.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And having departed to her house, she found the demon gone forth, and the daughter cast upon the bed.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And again, having gone out from the bounds of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, in the midst of the bounds of Decapolis.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And they bring to him a deaf one, tongue-tied; and they beseech him that he would put the hand upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And having taken him away from the crowd apart, he put his fingers in his ears, and having spit, he touched his tongue;</verse>
  <verse number="34">And having looked up to heaven, he sighed, and says to him, Ephphatha, which is, Be opened.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And quickly his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake rightly.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And he charged them that they should say to none: and as much as he charged them, they proclaimed more abundantly;</verse>
  <verse number="37">And above measure were they struck with amazement, saying, Well has he done all things: he makes the deaf to hear, and the speechless to speak.</verse>
