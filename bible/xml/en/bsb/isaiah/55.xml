<chapter book="Isaiah" number="55" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">“Come, all you who are thirsty, come to the waters; and you without money, come, buy, and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost!</verse>
  <verse number="2">Why spend money on that which is not bread, and your labor on that which does not satisfy? Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good, and your soul will delight in the richest of foods.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Incline your ear and come to Me; listen, so that your soul may live. I will make with you an everlasting covenant—My loving devotion promised to David.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Behold, I have made him a witness to the nations, a leader and commander of the peoples.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Surely you will summon a nation you do not know, and nations who do not know you will run to you. For the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, has bestowed glory on you.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">Seek the LORD while He may be found; call on Him while He is near.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Let the wicked man forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return to the LORD, that He may have compassion, and to our God, for He will freely pardon.</verse>
  <verse number="8">“For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways,” declares the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="9">“For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so My ways are higher than your ways and My thoughts than your thoughts.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For just as rain and snow fall from heaven and do not return without watering the earth, making it bud and sprout, and providing seed to sow and food to eat,</verse>
  <verse number="11">so My word that proceeds from My mouth will not return to Me empty, but it will accomplish what I please, and it will prosper where I send it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">You will indeed go out with joy and be led forth in peace; the mountains and hills will burst into song before you, and all the trees of the field will clap their hands.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Instead of the thornbush, the cypress will grow, and instead of the brier, the myrtle will spring up; this will make a name for the LORD, an everlasting sign, never to be destroyed.”</verse>
