  <verse number="1">AND it came to pass, that on one of the days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and preaching the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes, with the ancients, met together,</verse>
  <verse number="2">And spoke to him, saying: Tell us, by what authority dost thou these things? or, Who is he that hath given thee this authority?</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Jesus answering, said to them: I will also ask you one thing. Answer me:</verse>
  <verse number="4">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?</verse>
  <verse number="5">But they thought within themselves, saying: If we shall say, From heaven: he will say: Why then did you not believe him?</verse>
  <verse number="6">But if we say, Of men, the whole people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they answered, that they knew not whence it was.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Jesus said to them: Neither do I tell thee by what authority I do these things.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he began to speak to the people this parable: A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it out to husbandmen: and he was abroad for a long time.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard. Who, beating him, sent him away empty.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And again he sent another servant. But they beat him also, and treating him reproachfully, sent him away empty.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And again he sent the third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then the lord of the vineyard said: What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be, when they see him, they will reverence him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Whom when the husbandmen saw, they thought within themselves, saying: This is the heir, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</verse>
  <verse number="15">So casting him out of the vineyard, they killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
  <verse number="16">He will come, and will destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others. Which they hearing, said to him: God forbid.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But he looking on them, said: What is this then that is written, The stone, which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Whosoever shall fall upon that stone, shall be bruised: and upon whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him the same hour: but they feared the people, for they knew that he spoke this parable to them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And being upon the watch, they sent spies, who should feign themselves just, that they might take hold of him in his words, that they might deliver him up to the authority and power of the governor.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they asked him, saying: Master, we know that thou speakest and teachest rightly: and thou dost not respect any person, but teachest the way of God in truth.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or no?</verse>
  <verse number="23">But he considering their guile, said to them: Why tempt you me?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Shew me a penny. Whose image and inscription hath it? They answering, said to him, Caesar’s.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he said to them: Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s: and to God the things that are God’s.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And they could not reprehend his word before the people: and wondering at his answer, they held their peace.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And there came to him some of the Sadducees, who deny that there is any resurrection, and they asked him,</verse>
  <verse number="28">Saying: Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man’s brother die, having a wife, and he leave no children, that his brother should take her to wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="29">There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And the next took her to wife, and he also died childless.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the third took her. And in like manner all the seven, and they left no children, and died.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Last of all the woman died also.</verse>
  <verse number="33">In the resurrection therefore, whose wife of them shall she be? For all the seven had her to wife.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Jesus said to them: The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:</verse>
  <verse number="35">But they that shall be accounted worthy of that world, and of the resurrection from the dead, shall neither be married, nor take wives.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Neither can they die any more: for they are equal to the angels, and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Now that the dead rise again, Moses also shewed, at the bush, when he called the Lord, The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;</verse>
  <verse number="38">For he is not the God of the dead, but of the living: for all live to him.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And some of the scribes answering, said to him: Master, thou hast said well.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And after that they durst not ask him any more questions.</verse>
  <verse number="41">But he said to them: How say they that Christ is the son of David?</verse>
  <verse number="42">And David himself saith in the book of Psalms: The Lord said to my Lord, sit thou on my right hand,</verse>
  <verse number="43">Till I make thy enemies thy footstool.</verse>
  <verse number="44">David then calleth him Lord: and how is he his son?</verse>
  <verse number="45">And in the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples:</verse>
  <verse number="46">Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love salutations in the marketplace, and the first chairs in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts:</verse>
  <verse number="47">Who devour the houses of widows, feigning long prayer. These shall receive greater damnation.</verse>
