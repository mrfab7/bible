  <verse number="1">After this, Eliu again spoke in this way:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Does it seem right to you in your thoughts, that you should say, “I am more just than God?”</verse>
  <verse number="3">For you said, “Having done what is right does not please you,” and, “How will it benefit you, if I sin?”</verse>
  <verse number="4">And so, I will respond to your words, and to your friends who are with you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Look up towards heaven and consider; also, think about the sky, which is higher than you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">If you sin, how will it hurt him? And if your iniquities are multiplied, what will you do against him?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Furthermore, if you act justly, what will you give him, or what will he receive from your hand?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Your impiety may hurt a man who is like you, though your justice may help the son of the man.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Because of the multitude of false accusers, they will cry out; and they will lament because of the strong arm of the tyrants.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Yet he has not said: “Where is God, who made me, who has given songs in the night,</verse>
  <verse number="11">who teaches us in addition to the beasts of the earth, and who educates us along with the birds of the air?”</verse>
  <verse number="12">There they will cry, and he will not heed them, because of the arrogance of the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Therefore, God does not hear in vain, and the Almighty will look into each and every case.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And so, when you say, “He does not examine,” be judged before him, but wait for him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For, at the present time, he does not bring forth his fury, nor does he punish sin exceedingly.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore, Job has opened his mouth in vain and has multiplied words without knowledge.</verse>
