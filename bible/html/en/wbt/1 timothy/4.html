<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving by them who believe and know the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if received with thanksgiving:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For it is sanctified by the word of God, and prayer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If thou shalt put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou wilt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished by the words of faith and of good doctrine, to which thou hast attained.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But refuse profane and old wivesâ€™ fables, and exercise thyself rather to godliness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable to all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For therefore we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God who is the Savior of all men, especially of those that believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">These things command and teach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in deportment, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Take heed to thyself and to thy doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou wilt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.</p>
