<p class="verse" data-verse="1">For this cause, I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ, for you Gentiles;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">If yet you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me towards you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">How that, according to revelation, the mystery has been made known to me, as I have written above in a few words;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">As you reading, may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Which in other generations was not known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and co-partners of his promise in Christ Jesus, by the gospel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Of which I am made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God, which is given to me according to the operation of his power:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">To me, the least of all the saints, is given this grace, to preach among the Gentiles, the unsearchable riches of Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And to enlighten all men, that they may see what is the dispensation of the mystery which hath been hidden from eternity in God, who created all things:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">That the manifold wisdom of God may be made known to the principalities and powers in heavenly places through the church,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">According to the eternal purpose, which he made, in Christ Jesus our Lord:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Wherefore I pray you not to faint at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Of whom all paternity in heaven and earth is named,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened by his Spirit with might unto the inward man,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">That Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts; that being rooted and founded in charity,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">You may be able to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth, and length, and height, and depth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">To know also the charity of Christ, which surpasseth all knowledge, that you may be filled unto all the fulness of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now to him who is able to do all things more abundantly than we desire or understand, according to the power that worketh in us;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">To him be glory in the church, and in Christ Jesus unto all generations, world without end. Amen.</p>
