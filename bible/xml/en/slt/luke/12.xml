  <verse number="1">Upon which, myriads of the crowd having been gathered together, so as to tread upon one another, he began to speak to his disciples first, Keep yourselves from the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And there is nothing covered, which shall not be revealed; and secret which shall not be known.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Therefore whatever ye have said in darkness shall be heard in light; and what ye spake to the ear in storehouses shall be proclaimed upon house-tops.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And I say to you, my friends, Be not afraid of those killing the body, and after these not having anything remaining to do.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And I will shew you whom ye should fear: Fear him having power, after killing, to cast into hell; yea, I say to you, Fear him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Are not five little sparrows sold for two small coins, and one of them is not forgotten before God?</verse>
  <verse number="7">But also the hairs of your head were all numbered. Therefore fear not: ye have the preeminence over many little sparrows.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And I say to you, Every one who should acknowledge in me before men, also the Son of man will acknowledge in him before the messengers of God.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he having denied me before men, shall he denied before the messengers of God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And every one who shall say a word against the Son of man, it shall be remitted to him: and to him blaspheming against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be remitted.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And when they bring you to assemblies, and beginnings, and powers, have no anxiety how or what ye allege for justification, or what ye say:</verse>
  <verse number="12">For the Holy Spirit will teach you in that hour what ye must say.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And a certain one out of the crowd said to him, Teacher, speak to my brother to divide the inheritance with me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he said to him, Man, who appointed me judge or distributer over you.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he said to them, See, and watch yourselves from covetousness: for not in the abounding to any one of his possessions is his life.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he spake a parable to them, saying, The farm of a certain rich man bore well:</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he calculated in himself, saying, What shall I do, for I have not where I shall collect together my fruits?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my stores, and build greater; and there will I collect all my produce and my good things.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast many good things laid up for many years; rest, eat, drink, be gladdened.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And God said to him, O foolish one, this night they require thy soul from thee: and what thou hast prepared, to whom shall it be?</verse>
  <verse number="21">So he treasuring up for himself, and not rich toward God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he said to his disciples, Therefore I say to you, Have no anxiety for your soul, what ye eat; nor for the body what ye put on.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The soul is more than food, and the body than clothing.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Consider the ravens: for they sow not neither do they reap; to them there is not store-house nor store; and God nourishes them: how much more have ye preeminence of the fowls?</verse>
  <verse number="25">And which of you having anxiety can add to his size one cubit?</verse>
  <verse number="26">If then ye cannot do the least, why have ye anxiety for the rest?</verse>
  <verse number="27">Consider the white lilies, how they grow; they are not wearied, neither do they spin; and I say to you, neither was Solomon in all his glory clothed as one of these.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And if the grass, to day being in the field and to morrow cast into the furnace, God so clothes; how much rather you, ye of little faith?</verse>
  <verse number="29">And ye, seek ye not what ye eat, or what ye drink, and keep not in anxiety.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For all these things the nations of the world seek for: and your Father knows that ye have need of these.</verse>
  <verse number="31">But seek the kingdom of God; and all these shall be added to you.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Fear not, little flock; for your Father was contented to give you the kingdom.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Sell your possessions, and give alms; make to yourselves purses not growing old, an inexhaustible treasure in the heavens, where the thief approaches not, nor moth corrupts.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For where your treasure is, there also will be your heart.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;</verse>
  <verse number="36">And ye like men expecting their Lord, when he shall loose from the nuptials; that having come and knocked, they might quickly open to him.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Happy those servants, whom the Lord having come shall find watching; truly I say to you, he will gird himself, and make them recline, and having come he will serve them.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And if he should come in the second watch, and should come in the third watch, and find so, happy are those servants.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And know this, that if the master of the house knew what hour the thief is coming, he had watched, and not have suffered his house to be undermined.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And be ye therefore ready: for in the time which ye think not the Son of man is coming.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And Peter said to him, Lord, sayest thou this parable to us, or also to all?</verse>
  <verse number="42">And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward, which the Lord will set over his household, to give the allowance of wheat in due time?</verse>
  <verse number="43">Happy that servant, which his Lord, having come, shall find so doing.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Truly I say to you, that he will set him over all his possessions.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And if that servant should say in his heart, My Lord delays to come; and should begin to strike the servants and maids, also to eat and drink, and to be intoxicated;</verse>
  <verse number="46">The lord of that servant shall come in a day which he expects not, and in an hour which he knows not, and he will cut him in two equal parts, and set his portion with the unbelieving.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And that servant having known his lord’s will, and not prepared, neither having done his will, shall be skinned with many.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And he not having known, and having done things worthy of blows, shall be skinned with few. And to every one to whom much was given, shall much be required of him: and with whom they have deposited much, they will ask of him the more.</verse>
  <verse number="49">I have come to cast fire into the earth; and what will I if it has been already lighted up!</verse>
  <verse number="50">And I have an immersion to be immersed with; and how am I pressed together till it should be finished!</verse>
  <verse number="51">Think ye that I came to give peace in the earth? Nay, I say to you; but rather division:</verse>
  <verse number="52">For from now shall five be in one house divided, three against two, and two against three.</verse>
  <verse number="53">Father shall be divided against son, and son against father; mother against daughter, and daughter against mother; mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</verse>
  <verse number="54">And he said to the crowds, When ye see a cloud rising from the descents, ye say quickly, A heavy shower of rain is coming; and it is so.</verse>
  <verse number="55">And when the south wind blowing, ye say, That there will be heat; and it is.</verse>
  <verse number="56">O hypocrites, ye know to judge the face of the earth and of heaven; and how do ye not judge this time?</verse>
  <verse number="57">And why also of yourselves judge ye not the just thing?</verse>
  <verse number="58">For when thou retirest with thine adversary to the ruler, in the way give labor to be released from him; lest he drag thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the avenger, and the avenger cast thee into prison.</verse>
  <verse number="59">I say to thee, thou shouldest not come out thence, even till also thou shouldest give back the last small coin.</verse>
