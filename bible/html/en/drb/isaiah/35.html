<p class="verse" data-verse="1">THE land that was desolate and impassable shall be glad, and the wilderness shall rejoice, and shall flourish like the lily.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">It shall bud forth and blossom, and shall rejoice with joy and praise: the glory of Libanus is given to it: the beauty of Carmel, and Saron, they shall see the glory of the Lord, and the beauty of our God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Strengthen ye the feeble hands, and confirm the weak knees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Say to the fainthearted: Take courage, and fear not: behold your God will bring the revenge of recompense: God himself will come and will save you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall be free: for waters are broken out in the desert, and streams in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And that which was dry land, shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water. In the dens where dragons dwell before, shall rise up the verdure of the reed and the bulrush.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And a path and a way shall be there, and it shall be called the holy way: the unclean shall not pass over it, and this shall be unto you a straight way, so that fools shall not err therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">No lion shall be there, nor shall any mischievous beast go up by it, nor be found there: but they shall walk there that shall be delivered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the redeemed of the Lord shall return, and shall come into Sion with praise, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.</p>
