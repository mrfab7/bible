<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The righteous perisheth and no man layeth it to heart; and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">He entereth into peace; they rest in their beds, each one that walketh in his uprightness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and the whore.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">ye that inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree; that slay the children in the valleys, under the clefts of the rocks?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Among the smooth stones of the valley is thy portion; they, they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast offered an oblation. Shall I be appeased for these things?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Upon a high and lofty mountain hast thou set thy bed: thither also wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And behind the doors and the posts hast thou set up thy memorial: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase thy perfumes, and didst send thine ambassadors far off, and didst debase thyself even unto hell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thou wast wearied with the length of thy way; yet saidst thou not, There is no hope: thou didst find a quickening of thy strength; therefore thou wast not faint.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And of whom hast thou been afraid and in fear, that thou liest, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart? have not I held my peace even of long time, and fearest me not?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I will declare thy righteousness; and as for thy works, they shall not profit thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">When thou criest, let them which thou hast gathered deliver thee; but the wind shall take them, a breath shall carry them all away: but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth and smote him, I hid my face and was wroth: and he went on frowardly in the way of his heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I create the fruit of the lips: Peace, peace, to him that is far off and to him that is near, saith the LORD; and I will heal him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it cannot rest, and its waters cast up mire and dirt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.</p>
