<chapter book="Romans" number="8" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:</verse>
  <verse number="4">That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</verse>
  <verse number="8">So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Therefore, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For if you live after the flesh, you shall die: but if you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but you have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:</verse>
  <verse number="17">And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope,</verse>
  <verse number="21">Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For we know that the whole creation groans and travails in pain together until now.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man sees, why does he yet hope for?</verse>
  <verse number="25">But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</verse>
  <verse number="31">What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?</verse>
  <verse number="32">He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?</verse>
  <verse number="33">Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God’s elect? It is God that justifies.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Who is he that comdemns? It is Christ that died, yes rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</verse>
  <verse number="36">As it is written, For your sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.</verse>
  <verse number="37">No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.</verse>
  <verse number="38">For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come,</verse>
  <verse number="39">Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
