<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="21" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job will answer and say,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hearing, hear ye my speech, and this shall be your consolations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Suffer me and I will speak; and after my word ye will mock.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I, is my complaint to man? and then wherefore shall not my spirit be shortened?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Look to me and be astonished, and put the hand upon the mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And when I remembered and trembled, and horror took hold of my flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wherefore shall the unjust live? They grew old, also they were strong in power.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Their seed was established before their face with them, and their offspring before their eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Their houses peace from fear, and the rod of God not upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">His ox passed over and will not be cast away: his heifer will escape and will not be barren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They will send forth their children as a flock, and their children will leap.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They will lift up with the drum and harp, and they will rejoice at the voice of the pipe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Their days glided on in good, and in a moment they will lay hold of hades.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And they will say to God, Depart from us; and we desired not the knowledge of thy ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">What the Almighty that we shall serve him? and what shall we be profited if we shall supplicate to him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Behold, their good not in the hand: the counsel of the unjust was far from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">How often the light of the unjust shall be extinguished, and their destruction will come upon them. He will distribute pains in his anger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">They shall be as straw before the wind, and as chaff the storm stole it away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">God will lay up his iniquity for his sons: he will requite to him and be shall know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink from the wrath of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For what his delight in his house after him, and the number of? his months were divided out?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Shall he teach knowledge to God? and he will judge those lifted up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">This shall die in the strength of his fulness, altogether tranquil and at rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">His sides were filled with fat, and the marrow of his bones will, be moistened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And this will die in the soul of bitterness, and will not eat in good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">They will lie down together upon the dust, and the worm shall cover over them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Behold, I knew your purposes, and the devices ye will shake off against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For ye will say, Where the house of the noble one; and where the tent of the dwellings of the unjust?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Did ye not ask them passing over the way? and shall ye not know their signs?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">For the evil one will be spared for the day of destruction; they shalt be led away to the day of wraths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Who shall announce his way upon his face? and who shall requite to him that he did?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And he shall be led away to the graves, and shall watch over the tomb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And the clods of the valley were sweet to him, and every man shall draw after him, and before him no number.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And how will ye comfort me in vain, and your answers remained treachery?</p>
