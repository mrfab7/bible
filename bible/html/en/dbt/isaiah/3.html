<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="3" data-translation="Darby Bible Translation" data-translation-id="dbt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">For behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, will take away from Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">the mighty man and the man of war, the judge and the prophet, and the diviner and the elder,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">the captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the clever among artificers, and the one versed in enchantments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I will appoint youths as their princes, and children shall rule over them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the people shall be oppressed one by the other, and each by his neighbour; the child will be insolent against the elder, and the base against the honourable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When a man shall take hold of his brother, in his fatherâ€™s house, [and shall say:] Thou hast clothing; be our chief, and let this ruin be under thy hand;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">he will lift up [his hand] in that day, saying, I cannot be a healer, and in my house there is neither bread nor clothing; ye shall not make me a chief of the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For Jerusalem stumbleth and Judah falleth, because their tongue and their doings are against Jehovah, to provoke the eyes of his glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The look of their face doth witness against them, and they declare their sin as Sodom: they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have brought evil upon themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Say ye of the righteous that it shall be well [with him], for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill [with him], because the desert of his hands shall be rendered unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">[As for] my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. My people! they that guide thee mislead [thee], and destroy the way of thy paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Jehovah setteth himself to plead, and standeth to judge the peoples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of his people and their princes, [saying:] It is ye that have eaten up the vineyard: the spoil of the poor is in your houses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">What mean ye that ye crush my people, and grind the faces of the afflicted? saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Jehovah said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched-out neck and wanton eyes, and go along mincing, and making a tinkling with their feet;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">therefore the Lord will make bald the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and Jehovah will lay bare their secret parts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">In that day the Lord will take away the ornament of anklets, and the little suns and crescents,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">the pearl-drops, and the bracelets, and the veils,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">the head-dresses, and the stepping chains, and the girdles, and the scent-boxes, and the amulets;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">the finger-rings, and the nose-rings;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">the festival-robes, and the tunics, and the mantles, and the wallets;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">the mirrors, and the fine linen bodices, and the turbans, and the flowing veils.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And it shall come to pass, instead of perfume there shall be rottenness; and instead of a girdle, a rope; and instead of well-set hair, baldness; and instead of a robe of display, a girding of sackcloth; brand instead of beauty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the fight;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">and her gates shall lament and mourn; and, stripped, she shall sit upon the ground.</p>
