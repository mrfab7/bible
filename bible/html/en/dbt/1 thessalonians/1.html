<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul and Silvanus and Timotheus to the assembly of Thessalonians in God [the] Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ. Grace to you and peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you at our prayers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">remembering unceasingly your work of faith, and labour of love, and enduring constancy of hope, of our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">knowing, brethren beloved by God, your election.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For our glad tidings were not with you in word only, but also in power, and in [the] Holy Spirit, and in much assurance; even as ye know what we were among you for your sakes:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and ye became our imitators, and of the Lord, having accepted the word in much tribulation with joy of [the] Holy Spirit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">so that ye became models to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">for the word of the Lord sounded out from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith which [is] towards God has gone abroad, so that we have no need to say anything;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">for they themselves relate concerning us what entering in we had to you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and to await his Son from the heavens, whom he raised from among the dead, Jesus, our deliverer from the coming wrath.</p>
