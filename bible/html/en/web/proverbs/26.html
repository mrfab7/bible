<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="26" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Like snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honor is not fitting for a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Like a fluttering sparrow, like a darting swallow, so the undeserved curse doesn’t come to rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A whip is for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the back of fools!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Don’t answer a fool according to his folly, lest you also be like him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">One who sends a message by the hand of a fool is cutting off feet and drinking violence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Like the legs of the lame that hang loose: so is a parable in the mouth of fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">As one who binds a stone in a sling, so is he who gives honor to a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Like a thornbush that goes into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">As an archer who wounds all, so is he who hires a fool or he who hires those who pass by.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">As a dog that returns to his vomit, so is a fool who repeats his folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Do you see a man wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The sluggard says, “There is a lion in the road! A fierce lion roams the streets!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">As the door turns on its hinges, so does the sluggard on his bed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The sluggard buries his hand in the dish. He is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who answer with discretion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Like one who grabs a dog’s ears is one who passes by and meddles in a quarrel not his own.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Like a madman who shoots torches, arrows, and death,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, “Am I not joking?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For lack of wood a fire goes out. Without gossip, a quarrel dies down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">As coals are to hot embers, and wood to fire, so is a contentious man to kindling strife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, they go down into the innermost parts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Like silver dross on an earthen vessel are the lips of a fervent one with an evil heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">A malicious man disguises himself with his lips, but he harbors evil in his heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">When his speech is charming, don’t believe him; for there are seven abominations in his heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">His malice may be concealed by deception, but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Whoever digs a pit shall fall into it. Whoever rolls a stone, it will come back on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A lying tongue hates those it hurts; and a flattering mouth works ruin.</p>
