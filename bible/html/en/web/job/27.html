<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Job again took up his parable, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“As God lives, who has taken away my right, the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">(For the length of my life is still in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils);</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">surely my lips shall not speak unrighteousness, neither shall my tongue utter deceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Far be it from me that I should justify you. Until I die I will not put away my integrity from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I hold fast to my righteousness, and will not let it go. My heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">“Let my enemy be as the wicked. Let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For what is the hope of the godless, when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Will God hear his cry when trouble comes on him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Will he delight himself in the Almighty, and call on God at all times?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I will teach you about the hand of God. That which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">“This is the portion of a wicked man with God, the heritage of oppressors, which they receive from the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword. His offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Those who remain of him shall be buried in death. His widows shall make no lamentation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare clothing as the clay;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">he may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He builds his house as the moth, as a booth which the watchman makes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He lies down rich, but he shall not do so again. He opens his eyes, and he is not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Terrors overtake him like waters. A storm steals him away in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The east wind carries him away, and he departs. It sweeps him out of his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For it hurls at him, and does not spare, as he flees away from his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.</p>
