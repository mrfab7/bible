<p class="verse" data-verse="1">AFTER these things was a festival day of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Now there is at Jerusalem a pond, called Probatica, which in Hebrew is named Bethsaida, having five porches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">In these lay a great multitude of sick, of blind, of lame, of withered; waiting for the moving of the water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And an angel of the Lord descended at certain times into the pond; and the water was moved. And he that went down first into the pond after the motion of the water, was made whole, of whatsoever infirmity he lay under.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And there was a certain man there, that had been eight and thirty years under his infirmity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Him when Jesus had seen lying, and knew that he had been now a long time, he saith to him: Wilt thou be made whole?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The infirm man answered him: Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pond. For whilst I am coming, another goeth down before me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Jesus saith to him: Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And immediately the man was made whole: and he took up his bed, and walked. And it was the sabbath that day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The Jews therefore said to him that was healed: It is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He answered them: He that made me whole, he said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They asked him therefore: Who is that man who said to thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But he who was healed, knew not who it was; for Jesus went aside from the multitude standing in the place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Afterwards, Jesus findeth him in the temple, and saith to him: Behold thou art made whole: sin no more, lest some worse thing happen to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The man went his way, and told the Jews, that it was Jesus who had made him whole.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But Jesus answered them: My Father worketh until now; and I work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Hereupon therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he did not only break the sabbath, but also said God was his Father, making himself equal to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Then Jesus answered, and said to them: Amen, amen, I say unto you, the Son cannot do any thing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doth, these the Son also doth in like manner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things which himself doth: and greater works than these will he shew him, that you may wonder.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and giveth life: so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For neither doth the Father judge any man, but hath given all judgment to the Son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">That all men may honour the Son, as they honour the Father. He who honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father, who hath sent him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Amen, amen I say unto you, that he who heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath life everlasting; and cometh not into judgment, but is passed from death to life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Amen, amen I say unto you, that the hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For as the Father hath life in himself, so he hath given the Son also to have life in himself:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And he hath given him power to do judgment, because he is the Son of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Wonder not at this; for the hour cometh, wherein all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And they that have done good things, shall come forth unto the resurrection of life; but they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">I cannot of myself do any thing. As I hear, so I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">You sent to John, and he gave testimony to the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">But I receive not testimony from man: but I say these things, that you may be saved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a time to rejoice in his light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">But I have a greater testimony than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to perfect; the works themselves, which I do, give testimony of me, that the Father hath sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And the Father himself who hath sent me, hath given testimony of me: neither have you heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And you have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him you believe not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Search the scriptures, for you think in them to have life everlasting; and the same are they that give testimony of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And you will not come to me that you may have life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">I receive glory not from men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">But I know you, that you have not the love of God in you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">I am come in the name of my Father, and you receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">How can you believe, who receive glory one from another: and the glory which is from God alone, you do not seek?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Think not that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one that accuseth you, Moses, in whom you trust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">For if you did believe Moses, you would perhaps believe me also; for he wrote of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?</p>
