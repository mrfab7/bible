  <verse number="1">Now a certain man, named Lazarus, of Bethany, was lying ill—Bethany being the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
  <verse number="2"></verse>
  <verse number="3">So the sisters sent to Him to say, “Master, he whom you hold dear is ill.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">Jesus received the message and said, “This illness is not to end in death, but is to promote the glory of God, in order that the Son of God may be glorified by it.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</verse>
  <verse number="6">When, however, He heard that Lazarus was ill, He still remained two days in that same place.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then, after that, He said to the disciples, “Let us return to Judaea.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">“Rabbi,” exclaimed the disciples, “the Jews have just been trying to stone you, and do you think of going back there again?”</verse>
  <verse number="9">“Are there not twelve hours in the day?” replied Jesus. “If any one walks in the daytime, he does not stumble—because he sees the light of this world.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But if a man walks by night, he does stumble, because the light is not in him.”</verse>
  <verse number="11">He said this, and afterwards He added, “Our friend Lazarus is sleeping, but I will go and wake him.”</verse>
  <verse number="12">“Master,” said the disciples, “if he is asleep he will recover.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought He referred to the rest taken in ordinary sleep.</verse>
  <verse number="14">So then He told them plainly,</verse>
  <verse number="15">“Lazarus is dead; and for your sakes I am glad I was not there, in order that you may believe. But let us go to him.”</verse>
  <verse number="16">“Let us go also,” Thomas, the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, “that we may die with him.”</verse>
  <verse number="17">On His arrival Jesus found that Lazarus had already been three days in the tomb.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Bethany was near Jerusalem, the distance being a little less than two miles;</verse>
  <verse number="19">and a considerable number of the Jews were with Martha and Mary, having come to express sympathy with them on the death of their brother.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Martha, however, as soon as she heard the tidings, “Jesus is coming,” went to meet Him; but Mary remained sitting in the house.</verse>
  <verse number="21">So Martha came and spoke to Jesus. “Master, if you had been here,” she said, “my brother would not have died.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And even now I know that whatever you ask God for, God will give you.”</verse>
  <verse number="23">“Your brother shall rise again,” replied Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="24">“I know,” said Martha, “that he will rise again at the resurrection, on the last day.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">“I am the Resurrection and the Life,” said Jesus; “he who believes in me, even if he has died, he shall live;</verse>
  <verse number="26">and every one who is living and is a believer in me shall never, never die. Do you believe this?”</verse>
  <verse number="27">“Yes, Master,” she replied; “I thoroughly believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.”</verse>
  <verse number="28">After saying this, she went and called her sister Mary privately, telling her, “The Rabbi is here and is asking for you.”</verse>
  <verse number="29">So she, on hearing that, rose up quickly to go to Him.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met Him.</verse>
  <verse number="31">So the Jews who were with Mary in the house sympathizing with her, when they saw that she had risen hastily and had gone out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep aloud there.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Mary then, when she came to Jesus and saw Him, fell at His feet and exclaimed, “Master, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”</verse>
  <verse number="33">Seeing her weeping aloud, and the Jews in like manner weeping who had come with her, Jesus, curbing the strong emotion of His spirit,</verse>
  <verse number="34">though deeply troubled, asked them, “Where have you laid him?” “Master, come and see,” was their reply.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Jesus wept.</verse>
  <verse number="36">“See how dear he held him,” said the Jews.</verse>
  <verse number="37">But others of them asked, “Was this man who opened the blind man’s eyes unable to prevent this man from dying?”</verse>
  <verse number="38">Jesus, however, again restraining His strong feeling, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone had been laid against the mouth of it.</verse>
  <verse number="39">“Take away the stone,” said Jesus. Martha, the sister of the dead man, exclaimed, “Master, by this time there is a foul smell; for it is three days since he died.”</verse>
  <verse number="40">“Did I not promise you,” replied Jesus, “that if you believe, you shall see the glory of God?”</verse>
  <verse number="41">So they removed the stone. Then Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, “Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard me.</verse>
  <verse number="42">I know that Thou always hearest me; but for the sake of the crowd standing round I have said this—that they may believe that Thou didst send me.”</verse>
  <verse number="43">After speaking thus, He called out in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out.”</verse>
  <verse number="44">The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped in cloths, and his face wrapped round with a towel. “Untie him,” said Jesus, “and let him go free.”</verse>
  <verse number="45">Thereupon a considerable number of the Jews—namely those who had come to Mary and had witnessed His deeds—became believers in Him;</verse>
  <verse number="46">though some of them went off to the Pharisees and told them what He had done.</verse>
  <verse number="47">Therefore the High Priests and the Pharisees held a meeting of the Sanhedrin. “What steps are we taking?” they asked one another; “for this man is performing a great number of miracles.</verse>
  <verse number="48">If we leave him alone in this way, everybody will believe in him, and the Romans will come and blot out both our city and our nation.”</verse>
  <verse number="49">But one of them, named Caiaphas, being High Priest that year, said, “You know nothing about it.</verse>
  <verse number="50">You do not reflect that it is to your interest that one man should die for the people rather than the whole nation perish.”</verse>
  <verse number="51">It was not as a mere man that he thus spoke. But being High Priest that year he was inspired to declare that Jesus was to die for the nation,</verse>
  <verse number="52">and not for the nation only, but in order to unite into one body all the far-scattered children of God.</verse>
  <verse number="53">So from that day forward they planned and schemed in order to put Him to death.</verse>
  <verse number="54">Therefore Jesus no longer went about openly among the Jews, but He left that neighbourhood and went into the district near the Desert, to a town called Ephraim, and remained there with the disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="55">The Jewish Passover was coming near, and many from that district went up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="56">They therefore looked out for Jesus, and asked one another as they stood in the Temple, “What do you think?—will he come to the Festival at all?”</verse>
  <verse number="57">Now the High Priests and the Pharisees had issued orders that if any one knew where He was, he should give information, so that they might arrest Him.</verse>
