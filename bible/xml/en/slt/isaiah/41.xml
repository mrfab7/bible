  <verse number="1">Be silent to me, ye islands; and the people shall change strength: they shall draw near; then shall they speak: together we will come near for judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Who raised up justice from the sunrising? he shall call him to his foot; he will give the nations before him; and he will bring down kings: he will give as the dust of his sword, as driven straw, his bow.</verse>
  <verse number="3">He will pursue them, he will pass over in peace; the path he will not come in with his feet.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who made and did, calling the generations from the beginning? I Jehovah, the first, and with the last; I am he.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The isles saw, and they will be afraid; the extremities of the earth will tremble; they drew near and they will come.</verse>
  <verse number="6">They will help a man his neighbor, and he will say to his brother, Be strong.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the artificer will strengthen the founder, he making smooth with the hammer, he beating the anvil, saying, It is good for the welding; he will strengthen it with nails; it shall not totter.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And thou, Israel, my servant Jacob whom I chose thee, the seed of Abraham my beloved:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Whom I held thee fast from the extremities of the earth, and I called thee from its sides, and saying to thee, Thou my servant; I chose thee, and I rejected thee not.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Thou shalt not fear, for I am with thee: thou shalt not look around for help for I thy God will strengthen thee; also I helped thee; also I held thee up with the right hand of my justice.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Behold, all they burning with anger against thee shall be ashamed and disgraced: they shall be as nothing; and the men of thy strife shall be destroyed.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them; the man of thy contention, the men of thy war, shall be as nothing and as no more.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For I Jehovah thy God holding thy right hand, saying to thee, Thou shalt not fear; I helped thee.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thou shalt not fear, thou worm Jacob, ye men of Israel; I helped thee, says Jehovah, and thy redeemer the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Behold, I set thee to a new cutting threshing sledge having mouths: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat small, and the hills thou shalt set as chaff.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Thou shalt winnow them, and the wind shall lift them up, and the storm shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in Jehovah, and glory in the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The poor and the needy seeking water, and none; their tongue failing in thirst, I Jehovah will answer them; the God of Israel, I will not forsake them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I will open rivers upon naked hills, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will set the desert for a pool of water, and the dry land for goings forth of water.</verse>
  <verse number="19">I will give in the desert the cedar, the acacia, and the myrtle, and the tree of oil; I will set in the sterile region the the elm and the box tree together.</verse>
  <verse number="20">So that they shall see and know and attend, and consider together that the hand of Jehovah did this, and the Holy One of Israel created it.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Bring near your cause, Will say Jehovah; draw near your strong defences, will the king of Jacob say:</verse>
  <verse number="22">They shall draw near and announce to us what shall happen: shewed they the former things, what they were, and we will set our heart, and we shall know their latter state; or did we hear things coming?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Announce the things coming hereafter, and we shall know that ye are God: also will ye do good or will ye do evil, and we shall look around for help and see together.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Behold, ye are from nothing, and your work no more: an abomination he will choose in you.</verse>
  <verse number="25">I roused up from the north, and he will come: from the rising of the sun he shall call upon my name: and he shall come upon prefects as clay, and as the potter will tread down the mud.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Who announced from the beginning, and we shall know? and before, and we shall say, He is just; also none announcing; also none hearing; also none heard your words.</verse>
  <verse number="27">The first to Zion, Behold, behold them: and to Jerusalem I will give him announcing good news.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And I shall see, and no man; and from these, and no counselor; and I shall ask them, and they will not turn back a word.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Behold, all of them, nothing; their works are no more: wind and emptiness are their libations.</verse>
