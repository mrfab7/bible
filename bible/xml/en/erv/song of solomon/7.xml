  <verse number="1">How beautiful are thy feet in sandals, O prince’s daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thy navel is like a round goblet, wherein no mingled wine is wanting: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thy two breasts are like two fawns that are twins of a roe.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thy neck is like the tower of ivory; thine eyes as the pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim; thy nose is like the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king is held captive in the tresses thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="6">How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!</verse>
  <verse number="7">This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I said, I will climb up into the palm tree, I will take hold of the branches thereof: let thy breasts be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy breath like apples;</verse>
  <verse number="9">And thy mouth like the best wine, that goeth down smoothly for my beloved, gliding through the lips of those that are asleep.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I am my beloved’s, and his desire is toward me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see whether the vine hath budded, and its blossom be open, and the pomegranates be in flower: there will I give thee my love.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The mandrakes give forth fragrance, and at our doors are all manner of precious fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.</verse>
