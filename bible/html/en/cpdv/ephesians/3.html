<p class="verse" data-verse="1">By reason of this grace, I, Paul, am a prisoner of Jesus Christ, for the sake of you Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Now certainly, you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God, which has been given to me among you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">that, by means of revelation, the mystery was made known to me, just as I have written above in a few words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Yet, by reading this closely, you might be able to understand my prudence in the mystery of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">In other generations, this was unknown to the sons of men, even as it has now been revealed to his holy Apostles and Prophets in the Spirit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">so that the Gentiles would be co-heirs, and of the same body, and partners together, by his promise in Christ Jesus, through the Gospel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Of this Gospel, I have been made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God, which has been given to me by means of the operation of his virtue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Although I am the least of all the saints, I have been given this grace: to evangelize among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and to enlighten everyone concerning the dispensation of the mystery, hidden before the ages in God who created all things,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">so that the manifold wisdom of God may become well-known to the principalities and powers in the heavens, through the Church,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">according to that timeless purpose, which he has formed in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">In him we trust, and so we approach with confidence, through his faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Because of this, I ask you not to be weakened by my tribulations on your behalf; for this is your glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">By reason of this grace, I bend my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">from whom all paternity in heaven and on earth takes its name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And I ask him to grant to you to be strengthened in virtue by his Spirit, in accord with the wealth of his glory, in the inner man,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">so that Christ may live in your hearts through a faith rooted in, and founded on, charity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">So may you be able to embrace, with all the saints, what is the width and length and height and depth</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">of the charity of Christ, and even be able to know that which surpasses all knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now to him who is able to do all things, more abundantly than we could ever ask or understand, by means of the virtue which is at work in us:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">to him be glory, in the Church and in Christ Jesus, throughout every generation, forever and ever. Amen.</p>
