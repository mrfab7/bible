  <verse number="1">Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first to fight against them?</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Judah went up, and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek: and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Adoni-bezek said, seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their food under my table; as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.</verse>
  <verse number="8">(Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.)</verse>
  <verse number="9">And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites that dwelt on the mountain, and in the south, and in the valley.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjath-arba:) and they slew Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</verse>

  <verse number="16">And the children of the Kenite, Moses’s father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm-trees with the children of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.</verse>

  <verse number="27">Neither did Manasseh expel the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its towns, nor Tanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And it came to pass when Israel was strong, that they subjected the Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly expel them.</verse>
