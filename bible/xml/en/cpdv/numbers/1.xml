  <verse number="1">And the Lord spoke to Moses in the desert of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the covenant, on the first day of the second month, in the year after their departure from Egypt, saying:</verse>

  <verse number="3">from twenty years and above, of all the able-bodied men out of Israel, and you shall number them by their companies, you and Aaron.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And there shall be with you the leaders of the tribes, as well as of the houses, in their kinships,</verse>

  <verse number="38">Of the sons of Dan, by their generations and families, and the houses of their kinships, having been counted by the names of each one, from twenty years and above, of all who were able to go forth to war,</verse>

  <verse number="40">Of the sons of Asher, by their generations and families, and the houses of their kinships, having been counted by the names of each one, from twenty years and above, of all who were able to go forth to war,</verse>
  <verse number="41">there were forty thousand and one thousand five hundred.</verse>
  <verse number="42">Of the sons of Naphtali, by their generations and families, and the houses of their kinships, having been counted by the names of each one, from twenty years and above, of all who were able to go forth to war,</verse>
  <verse number="43">there were fifty-three thousand four hundred.</verse>
  <verse number="44">These are the ones who were numbered by Moses and Aaron and the twelve leaders of Israel, each one by the houses of their kinships.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And the entire number of the sons of Israel by their houses and families, from twenty years and above, who were able to go forth to war, were</verse>
  <verse number="46">six hundred three thousand five hundred fifty men.</verse>
  <verse number="47">But the Levites in the tribes of their families were not numbered with them.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="49">“Do not number the tribe of Levi, neither shall you take a total of them with the sons of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="50">But appoint them over the tabernacle of the testimony, and all its vessels, and whatever pertains to the ceremonies. They shall carry the tabernacle and all its articles. And they shall be for the ministry, and they shall encamp all around the tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="51">When you would depart, the Levites shall take down the tabernacle. When you are to make camp, they shall set it up. Any outsider who will approach it shall be killed.</verse>
  <verse number="52">Now the sons of Israel shall make camp, each one by his companies and bands, as well as his army.</verse>
  <verse number="53">Moreover, the Levites shall fix their tents all around the tabernacle, lest there be an indignation over the multitude of the sons of Israel. And they shall stand watch as guardians over the tabernacle of the testimony.”</verse>
  <verse number="54">Therefore, the sons of Israel acted according to everything that the Lord had instructed Moses.</verse>
