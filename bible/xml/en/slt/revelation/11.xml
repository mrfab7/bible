  <verse number="1">And a reed was given me like rod: and the messenger stood, saying, Arise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them worshipping in it.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the court-yard that without the temple throw out, and thou mayest not measure it: for it was given to the nations: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty-two months.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I will give to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days, surrounded with sackcloth.</verse>

  <verse number="10">And they dwelling upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and shall be gladdened, and shall send gifts to one another; for these two prophets tortured them dwelling upon the earth.</verse>

  <verse number="17">Saying, We return thanks to thee, O Lord God, the Omnipotent Ruler, who being, and who was, and who coming; for thou hast taken thy great power, and reigned.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the nations were angry, and thy wrath came, and the time of the dead, to be judged, and to give reward to thy servants the prophets, and to the holy, and to them fearing thy name, the small and great; and to destroy them destroying the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunders, and shakings, and great hail.</verse>
