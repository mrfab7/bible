<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, forget not my law; but let thy heart keep my commandments;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thy heart:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">So shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Trust in the LORD with all thy heart; and lean not to thy own understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he will direct thy paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Be not wise in thy own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Honor the LORD with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thy increase:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain of it than fine gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared to her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">My son, let not them depart from thy eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">So shall they be life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: but thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For the LORD will be thy confidence, and will keep thy foot from being taken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thy hand to do it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Say not to thy neighbor, Go, and come again, and to-morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Devise not evil against thy neighbor, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Strive not with a man without cause, if he hath done thee no harm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace to the lowly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.</p>
