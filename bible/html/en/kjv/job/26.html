<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How hast thou helped [him that is] without power? [how] savest thou the arm [that hath] no strength?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">How hast thou counselled [him that hath] no wisdom? and [how] hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Dead [things] are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Hell [is] naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, [and] hangeth the earth upon nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He holdeth back the face of his throne, [and] spreadeth his cloud upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Lo, these [are] parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?</p>
