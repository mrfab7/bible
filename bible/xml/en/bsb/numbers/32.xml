  <verse number="1">Now the Reubenites and Gadites, who had very large herds and flocks, surveyed the lands of Jazer and Gilead, and they saw that the region was suitable for livestock.</verse>
  <verse number="2">So the Gadites and Reubenites came to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the congregation, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="3">“Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon,</verse>
  <verse number="4">which the LORD conquered before the congregation of Israel, are suitable for livestock—and your servants have livestock.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">“If we have found favor in your sight,” they said, “let this land be given to your servants as a possession. Do not make us cross the Jordan.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">But Moses asked the Gadites and Reubenites, “Shall your brothers go to war while you sit here?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Why are you discouraging the Israelites from crossing into the land that the LORD has given them?</verse>
  <verse number="8">This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to inspect the land.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For when your fathers went up to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land that the LORD had given them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">So the anger of the LORD was kindled that day, and He swore an oath, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="11">‘Because they did not follow Me wholeheartedly, not one of the men twenty years of age or older who came out of Egypt will see the land that I swore to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—</verse>
  <verse number="12">not one except Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun—because they did follow the LORD wholeheartedly.’</verse>
  <verse number="13">The anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the whole generation who had done evil in His sight was gone.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Now behold, you, a brood of sinners, have risen up in place of your fathers to further stoke the burning anger of the LORD against Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For if you turn away from following Him, He will once again leave this people in the wilderness, and you will be the cause of their destruction.”</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then the Gadites and Reubenites approached Moses and said, “We want to build sheepfolds here for our livestock and cities for our little ones.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But we will arm ourselves and be ready to go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them into their place. Meanwhile, our little ones will remain in the fortified cities for protection from the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="18">We will not return to our homes until every Israelite has taken possession of his inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Yet we will not have an inheritance with them across the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the Jordan.”</verse>
  <verse number="20">Moses replied, “If you will do this—if you will arm yourselves before the LORD for battle,</verse>
  <verse number="21">and if every one of your armed men crosses the Jordan before the LORD, until He has driven His enemies out before Him,</verse>
  <verse number="22">then when the land is subdued before the LORD, you may return and be free of obligation to the LORD and to Israel. And this land will belong to you as a possession before the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But if you do not do this, you will certainly sin against the LORD—and be assured that your sin will find you out.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Build cities for your little ones and folds for your flocks, but do what you have promised.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">The Gadites and Reubenites said to Moses, “Your servants will do just as our lord commands.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Our children, our wives, our livestock, and all our animals will remain here in the cities of Gilead.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But your servants are equipped for war, and every man will cross over to the battle before the LORD, just as our lord says.”</verse>
  <verse number="28">So Moses gave orders about them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua son of Nun, and to the family leaders of the tribes of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Moses said to them, “If the Gadites and Reubenites cross the Jordan with you, with every man armed for battle before the LORD, and the land is subdued before you, then you are to give them the land of Gilead as a possession.</verse>
  <verse number="30">But if they do not arm themselves and go across with you, then they must accept their possession among you in the land of Canaan.”</verse>
  <verse number="31">The Gadites and Reubenites replied, “As the LORD has spoken to your servants, so we will do.</verse>
  <verse number="32">We will cross over into the land of Canaan armed before the LORD, that we may have our inheritance on this side of the Jordan.”</verse>
  <verse number="33">So Moses gave to the Gadites, to the Reubenites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan—the land including its cities and the territory surrounding them.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And the Gadites built up Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,</verse>
  <verse number="35">Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,</verse>
  <verse number="36">Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran as fortified cities, and they built folds for their flocks.</verse>
  <verse number="37">The Reubenites built up Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,</verse>
  <verse number="38">as well as Nebo and Baal-meon (whose names were changed), and Sibmah. And they renamed the cities they rebuilt.</verse>
  <verse number="39">The descendants of Machir son of Manasseh went to Gilead, captured it, and drove out the Amorites who were there.</verse>
  <verse number="40">So Moses gave Gilead to the clan of Machir son of Manasseh, and they settled there.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, went and captured their villages and called them Havvoth-jair.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And Nobah went and captured Kenath and its villages and called it Nobah, after his own name.</verse>
