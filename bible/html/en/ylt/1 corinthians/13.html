<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="13" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">If with the tongues of men and of messengers I speak, and have not love, I have become brass sounding, or a cymbal tinkling;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and if I have prophecy, and know all the secrets, and all the knowledge, and if I have all the faith, so as to remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and if I give away to feed others all my goods, and if I give up my body that I may be burned, and have not love, I am profited nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The love is long-suffering, it is kind, the love doth not envy, the love doth not vaunt itself, is not puffed up,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">doth not act unseemly, doth not seek its own things, is not provoked, doth not impute evil,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">rejoiceth not over the unrighteousness, and rejoiceth with the truth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">all things it beareth, all it believeth, all it hopeth, all it endureth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The love doth never fail; and whether there be prophecies, they shall become useless; whether tongues, they shall cease; whether knowledge, it shall become useless;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">for in part we know, and in part we prophecy;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and when that which is perfect may come, then that which is in part shall become useless.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">When I was a babe, as a babe I was speaking, as a babe I was thinking, as a babe I was reasoning, and when I have become a man, I have made useless the things of the babe;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">for we see now through a mirror obscurely, and then face to face; now I know in part, and then I shall fully know, as also I was known;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and now there doth remain faith, hope, loveâ€”these three; and the greatest of these is love.</p>
