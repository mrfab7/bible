  <verse number="1">If, then, any exhortation is in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</verse>
  <verse number="2">fulfil ye my joy, that ye may mind the same thing—having the same love—of one soul—minding the one thing,</verse>
  <verse number="3">nothing in rivalry or vain-glory, but in humility of mind one another counting more excellent than yourselves—</verse>
  <verse number="4">each not to your own look ye, but each also to the things of others.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For, let this mind be in you that is also in Christ Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="6">who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal to God,</verse>
  <verse number="7">but did empty himself, the form of a servant having taken, in the likeness of men having been made,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and in fashion having been found as a man, he humbled himself, having become obedient unto death—death even of a cross,</verse>
  <verse number="9">wherefore, also, God did highly exalt him, and gave to him a name that is above every name,</verse>
  <verse number="10">that in the name of Jesus every knee may bow—of heavenlies, and earthlies, and what are under the earth—</verse>
  <verse number="11">and every tongue may confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="12">So that, my beloved, as ye always obey, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, with fear and trembling your own salvation work out,</verse>
  <verse number="13">for God it is who is working in you both to will and to work for His good pleasure.</verse>
  <verse number="14">All things do without murmurings and reasonings,</verse>
  <verse number="15">that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God, unblemished in the midst of a generation crooked and perverse, among whom ye do appear as luminaries in the world,</verse>
  <verse number="16">the word of life holding forth, for rejoicing to me in regard to a day of Christ, that not in vain did I run, nor in vain did I labour;</verse>
  <verse number="17">but if also I am poured forth upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice and joy with you all,</verse>
  <verse number="18">because of this do ye also rejoice and joy with me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And I hope, in the Lord Jesus, Timotheus to send quickly to you, that I also may be of good spirit, having known the things concerning you,</verse>
  <verse number="20">for I have no one like-minded, who sincerely for the things concerning you will care,</verse>
  <verse number="21">for the whole seek their own things, not the things of the Christ Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="22">and the proof of him ye know, that as a child serveth a father, with me he did serve in regard to the good news;</verse>
  <verse number="23">him, indeed, therefore, I hope to send, when I may see through the things concerning me—immediately;</verse>
  <verse number="24">and I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall quickly come.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And I thought it necessary Epaphroditus—my brother, and fellow-workman, and fellow-soldier, and your apostle and servant to my need—to send unto you,</verse>
  <verse number="26">seeing he was longing after you all, and in heaviness, because ye heard that he ailed,</verse>
  <verse number="27">for he also ailed nigh to death, but God did deal kindly with him, and not with him only, but also with me, that sorrow upon sorrow I might not have.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The more eagerly, therefore, I did send him, that having seen him again ye may rejoice, and I may be the less sorrowful;</verse>
  <verse number="29">receive him, therefore, in the Lord, with all joy, and hold such in honour,</verse>
  <verse number="30">because on account of the work of the Christ he drew near to death, having hazarded the life that he might fill up your deficiency of service unto me.</verse>
