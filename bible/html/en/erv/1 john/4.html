<div class="chapter" data-book="1 John" data-chapter="4" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Beloved, believe not every spirit, but prove the spirits, whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: every spirit which confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and every spirit which confesseth not Jesus is not of God: and this is the spirit of the antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it cometh; and now it is in the world already.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Ye are of God, my little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">They are of the world: therefore speak they as of the world, and the world heareth them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he who is not of God heareth us not. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is begotten of God, and knoweth God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Herein was the love of God manifested in us, that God hath sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">No man hath beheld God at any time: if we love one another, God abideth in us, and his love is perfected in us:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">hereby know we that we abide in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And we have beheld and bear witness that the Father hath sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abideth in him, and he in God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And we know and have believed the love which God hath in us. God is love; and he that abideth in love abideth in God, and God abideth in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Herein is love made perfect with us, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is, even so are we in this world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">There is no fear in love: but perfect love casteth out fear, because fear hath punishment; and he that feareth is not made perfect in love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">We love, because he first loved us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, cannot love God whom he hath not seen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And this commandment have we from him, that he who loveth God love his brother also.</p>
