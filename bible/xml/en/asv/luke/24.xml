  <verse number="1">But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came unto the tomb, bringing the spices which they had prepared.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And it came to pass, while they were perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel:</verse>
  <verse number="5">and as they were affrighted and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</verse>
  <verse number="6">He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee,</verse>
  <verse number="7">saying that the Son of man must be delivered up into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And they remembered his words,</verse>
  <verse number="9">and returned from the tomb, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Now they were Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James: and the other women with them told these things unto the apostles.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And these words appeared in their sight as idle talk; and they disbelieved them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But Peter arose, and ran unto the tomb; and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths by themselves; and he departed to his home, wondering at that which was come to pass.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And behold, two of them were going that very day to a village named Emmaus, which was threescore furlongs from Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And they communed with each other of all these things which had happened.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And it came to pass, while they communed and questioned together, that Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he said unto them, What communications are these that ye have one with another, as ye walk? And they stood still, looking sad.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And one of them, named Cleopas, answering said unto him, Dost thou alone sojourn in Jerusalem and not know the things which are come to pass there in these days?</verse>
  <verse number="19">And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</verse>
  <verse number="20">and how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But we hoped that it was he who should redeem Israel. Yea and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things came to pass.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Moreover certain women of our company amazed us, having been early at the tomb;</verse>
  <verse number="23">and when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And certain of them that were with us went to the tomb, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he said unto them, O foolish men, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</verse>
  <verse number="26">Behooved it not the Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?</verse>
  <verse number="27">And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go further.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And they constrained him, saying, Abide with us; for it is toward evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in to abide with them.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And it came to pass, when he had sat down with them to meat, he took the bread and blessed; and breaking it he gave to them.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And they said one to another, Was not our heart burning within us, while he spake to us in the way, while he opened to us the scriptures?</verse>
  <verse number="33">And they rose up that very hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</verse>
  <verse number="34">saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And they rehearsed the things that happened in the way, and how he was known of them in the breaking of the bread.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And as they spake these things, he himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="37">But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they beheld a spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do questionings arise in your heart?</verse>
  <verse number="39">See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye behold me having.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And while they still disbelieved for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, Have ye here anything to eat?</verse>
  <verse number="42">And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And he took it, and ate before them.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And he said unto them, These are my words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Then opened he their mind, that they might understand the scriptures;</verse>
  <verse number="46">and he said unto them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer, and rise again from the dead the third day;</verse>
  <verse number="47">and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name unto all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="48">Ye are witnesses of these things.</verse>
  <verse number="49">And behold, I send forth the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city, until ye be clothed with power from on high.</verse>
  <verse number="50">And he led them out until they were over against Bethany: and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</verse>
  <verse number="51">And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="52">And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</verse>
  <verse number="53">and were continually in the temple, blessing God.</verse>
