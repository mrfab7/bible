<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook, or press down his tongue with a cord?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Can you put a rope into his nose, or pierce his jaw through with a hook?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Will he make many petitions to you, or will he speak soft words to you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Will he make a covenant with you, that you should take him for a servant forever?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Will you play with him as with a bird? Or will you bind him for your girls?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Will traders barter for him? Will they part him among the merchants?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Can you fill his skin with barbed irons, or his head with fish spears?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Lay your hand on him. Remember the battle, and do so no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Behold, the hope of him is in vain. Won’t one be cast down even at the sight of him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">None is so fierce that he dare stir him up. Who then is he who can stand before me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Who has first given to me, that I should repay him? Everything under the heavens is mine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">“I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who can strip off his outer garment? Who shall come within his jaws?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Who can open the doors of his face? Around his teeth is terror.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Strong scales are his pride, shut up together with a close seal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">They are joined one to another. They stick together, so that they can’t be pulled apart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">His sneezing flashes out light. His eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Out of his mouth go burning torches. Sparks of fire leap forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Out of his nostrils a smoke goes, as of a boiling pot over a fire of reeds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His breath kindles coals. A flame goes forth from his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">There is strength in his neck. Terror dances before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The flakes of his flesh are joined together. They are firm on him. They can’t be moved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">His heart is as firm as a stone, yes, firm as the lower millstone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">When he raises himself up, the mighty are afraid. They retreat before his thrashing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">If one attacks him with the sword, it can’t prevail; nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He counts iron as straw; and brass as rotten wood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The arrow can’t make him flee. Sling stones are like chaff to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Clubs are counted as stubble. He laughs at the rushing of the javelin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">His undersides are like sharp potsherds, leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">He makes the deep to boil like a pot. He makes the sea like a pot of ointment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He makes a path shine after him. One would think the deep had white hair.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">On earth there is not his equal, that is made without fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">He sees everything that is high. He is king over all the sons of pride.”</p>
