<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And passing by, he saw a man blind from birth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, he, or his parents, that he was born blind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Jesus answered, Neither did this sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God might be manifested in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I must work the works of him having sent me, while it is day: night comes, when none can work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">While I be in the world, I am the light of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Having said these, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and rubbed the clay upon the eyes of the blind,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And said to him, Retire, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is interpreted, Sent.) He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then the neighbors, and those seeing him before that he was blind, said, Is not this he sitting and begging?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Others said, This is he: and others, That he is like him: he said, That I am.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then said they to him, How were thine eyes opened?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He answered and said, A man called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said to me, Retire to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and having gone and washed, I saw again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Then said they to him, Where is he? He says I know not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They bring him to the Pharisees, him once blind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And it was the sabbath, when Jesus made clay, and opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he saw again. He said to them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Then said certain of the Pharisees, This man is not from God, for he keeps not the sabbath. Others said, How can a sinful man do such signs? And a division was among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">They say to the blind again, What sayest thou of him, for he opened thine eyes? He said, That he is a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then the Jews believed not of him that he was blind, and saw again, until they called the parents of him having looked up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, whom ye say that be was born blind how then does be now see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But how he now sees, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: he has age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">These said his parents, for they feared the Jews: for already had the Jews agreed, that if any should acknowledge him Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Therefore said his parents, That he has age; ask him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Then called they the man of a second time, who was blind, and said to him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is sinful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He answered and said, If he be sinful, I know not: one thing I know, that, being blind, now I see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And again said they to him, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He answered them, I told you already, and ye heard not: why wish ye to hear again? ye wish not also to be his disciples?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Mosesâ€™ disciples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">We know that God has spoken to Moses; but this, we know not whence he is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The man answered and said to them, For in this is it wonderful, that ye know not whence he is, and he opened mine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And we know that God hears not the sinful: but if any be godly, and do his will, this he hears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">From forever was it not heard that any opened the eyes of him born blind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If this one were not of God, he could do nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">They answered and said to him, In sins wert thou wholly born, and teachest thou us? And they cast him without.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Jesus heard that they cast him without; and having found him, said to him, Believest thou in the Son of God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe in him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And Jesus said to him, Thou hast also seen him, and he speaking with thee, the same is he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And he said I believe, Lord. And he worshipped him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they not seeing might see; and they seeing might be blind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And they being with him of the Pharisees heard these things, and said to him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">We are not also blind? Jesus said to them If ye were blind, ye had not sinned: and now ye say, That we see; therefore your sin remains.</p>
