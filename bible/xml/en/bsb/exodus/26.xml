<chapter book="Exodus" number="26" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">“You are to construct the tabernacle itself with ten curtains of finely spun linen, each with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and cherubim skillfully worked into them.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Each curtain shall be twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide—all curtains the same size.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Five of the curtains are to be joined together, and the other five joined as well.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Make loops of blue material on the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and do the same for the end curtain in the second set.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Make fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the end curtain of the second set, so that the loops line up opposite one another.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Make fifty gold clasps as well, and join the curtains together with the clasps, so that the tabernacle will be a unit.</verse>
  <verse number="7">You are to make curtains of goat hair for the tent over the tabernacle—eleven curtains in all.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Each of the eleven curtains is to be the same size—thirty cubits long and four cubits wide.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Join five of the curtains into one set and the other six into another. Then fold the sixth curtain over double at the front of the tent.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Make fifty loops along the edge of the end curtain in the first set, and fifty loops along the edge of the corresponding curtain in the second set.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Make fifty bronze clasps and put them through the loops to join the tent together as a unit.</verse>
  <verse number="12">As for the overlap that remains of the tent curtains, the half curtain that is left over shall hang down over the back of the tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the tent curtains will be a cubit longer on either side, and the excess will hang over the sides of the tabernacle to cover it.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Also make a covering for the tent out of ram skins dyed red, and over that a covering of fine leather.</verse>
  <verse number="15">You are to construct upright frames of acacia wood for the tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Each frame is to be ten cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Two tenons must be connected to each other for each frame. Make all the frames of the tabernacle in this way.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Construct twenty frames for the south side of the tabernacle,</verse>
  <verse number="19">with forty silver bases under the twenty frames—two bases for each frame, one under each tenon.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For the second side of the tabernacle, the north side, make twenty frames</verse>
  <verse number="21">and forty silver bases—two bases under each frame.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Make six frames for the rear of the tabernacle, the west side,</verse>
  <verse number="23">and two frames for the two back corners of the tabernacle,</verse>
  <verse number="24">coupled together from bottom to top and fitted into a single ring. These will serve as the two corners.</verse>
  <verse number="25">So there are to be eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two under each frame.</verse>
  <verse number="26">You are also to make five crossbars of acacia wood for the frames on one side of the tabernacle,</verse>
  <verse number="27">five for those on the other side, and five for those on the rear side of the tabernacle, to the west.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The central crossbar in the middle of the frames shall extend from one end to the other.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Overlay the frames with gold and make gold rings to hold the crossbars. Also overlay the crossbars with gold.</verse>
  <verse number="30">So you are to set up the tabernacle according to the pattern shown you on the mountain.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Make a veil of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen, with cherubim skillfully worked into it.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Hang it with gold hooks on four posts of acacia wood, overlaid with gold and standing on four silver bases.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And hang the veil from the clasps and place the ark of the Testimony behind the veil. So the veil will separate the Holy Place from the Most Holy Place.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Put the mercy seat on the ark of the Testimony in the Most Holy Place.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And place the table outside the veil on the north side of the tabernacle, and put the lampstand opposite the table, on the south side.</verse>
  <verse number="36">For the entrance to the tent, you are to make a curtain embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Make five posts of acacia wood for the curtain, overlay them with gold hooks, and cast five bronze bases for them.</verse>
