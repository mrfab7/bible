<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Who [is] this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Or [who] shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, [as if] it had issued out of the womb?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And brake up for it my decreed [place], and set bars and doors,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; [and] caused the dayspring to know his place;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">It is turned as clay [to] the seal; and they stand as a garment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Where [is] the way [where] light dwelleth? and [as for] darkness, where [is] the place thereof,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths [to] the house thereof?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Knowest thou [it], because thou wast then born? or [because] the number of thy days [is] great?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">By what way is the light parted, [which] scattereth the east wind upon the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">To cause it to rain on the earth, [where] no man [is; on] the wilderness, wherein [there is] no man;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">To satisfy the desolate and waste [ground]; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The waters are hid as [with] a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we [are]?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">When they couch in [their] dens, [and] abide in the covert to lie in wait?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.</p>
