  <verse number="1">And he entered again into Capernaum after [several] days, and it was reported that he was at [the] house;</verse>
  <verse number="2">and straightway many were gathered together, so that there was no longer any room, not even at the door; and he spoke the word to them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And there come to him [men] bringing a paralytic, borne by four;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and, not being able to get near to him on account of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where he was, and having dug [it] up they let down the couch on which the paralytic lay.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But Jesus, seeing their faith, says to the paralytic, Child, thy sins are forgiven [thee].</verse>
  <verse number="6">But certain of the scribes were there sitting, and reasoning in their hearts,</verse>
  <verse number="7">Why does this [man] thus speak? he blasphemes. Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?</verse>
  <verse number="8">And straightway Jesus, knowing in his spirit that they are reasoning thus within themselves, said to them, Why reason ye these things in your hearts?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, [Thy] sins are forgiven [thee]; or to say, Arise, and take up thy couch and walk?</verse>
  <verse number="10">But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, he says to the paralytic,</verse>
  <verse number="11">To thee I say, Arise, take up thy couch and go to thine house.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he rose up straightway, and, having taken up his couch, went out before [them] all, so that all were amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw it thus.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he went out again by the sea, and all the crowd came to him, and he taught them.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And passing by, he saw Levi the [son] of Alphaeus sitting at the tax-office, and says to him, Follow me. And he rose up and followed him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And it came to pass as he lay at table in his house, that many tax-gatherers and sinners lay at table with Jesus and his disciples; for they were many, and they followed him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the scribes and the Pharisees, seeing him eating with sinners and tax-gatherers, said to his disciples, Why [is it] that he eats and drinks with tax-gatherers and sinners?</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Jesus having heard [it] says to them, They that are strong have not need of a physician, but those who are ill. I have not come to call righteous [men], but sinners.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting; and they come and say to him, Why do the disciples of John and [the disciples] of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bride-chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But days will come when the bridegroom shall have been taken away from them, and then shall they fast in that day.</verse>
  <verse number="21">No one sews a patch of new cloth on an old garment: otherwise its new filling-up takes from the old [stuff], and there is a worse rent.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And no one puts new wine into old skins; otherwise the wine bursts the skins, and the wine is poured out, and the skins will be destroyed; but new wine is to be put into new skins.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And it came to pass that he went on the sabbath through the cornfields; and his disciples began to walk on, plucking the ears.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the Pharisees said to him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath what is not lawful?</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he said to them, Have ye never read what David did when he had need and hungered, he and those with him,</verse>
  <verse number="26">how he entered into the house of God, in [the section of] Abiathar [the] high priest, and ate the shew-bread, which it is not lawful unless for the priests to eat, and gave even to those that were with him?</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he said to them, The sabbath was made on account of man, not man on account of the sabbath;</verse>
  <verse number="28">so that the Son of man is lord of the sabbath also.</verse>
