<chapter book="Isaiah" number="59" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Behold, the hand of Jehovah was not shortened from saving, and his ear heavy from hearing:</verse>
  <verse number="2">But your iniquities were separating between you and between your God, and your sins caused to hide the face from you from hearing.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For your hands were polluted with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips spake falsehood, your tongue will mutter evil.</verse>
  <verse number="4">None called upon justice, and none judged in truth: trusting in vanity and speaking evil, they conceived labor and brought forth vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="5">They plundered vipers eggs, and they will weave spiders webs: he eating from their eggs shall die, and being crushed, it shall break forth a viper.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Their webs shall not be for a garment, and they shall not be covered with their works: their works the works of vanity, and the work of violence in their hands.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Their feet will run to evil, and they will hasten to pour out innocent blood: their purposes, purposes of vanity; destruction and breaking in their highways.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The way of peace they knew not, and no judgment in their paths: they perverted their beaten paths for themselves: every one treading in it shall not know peace.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For this judgment was far off from us, and justice shall not overtake us: we shall wait for light, and behold, darkness; for brightness, and we shall walk in thick darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="10">We shall feel for the wall as the blind, and we shall feel, as no eyes: we stumbled at noon as at evening twilight; in fertile fields as the dead.</verse>
  <verse number="11">We shall growl as bears all of us, and murmuring we shall murmur as doves: we shall wait for judgment, and none; for salvation, it was far from us.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For our transgressions were multiplied before thee, and our sins answered against us: for our transgressions are with us, and our iniquities we knew them.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Transgressing and lying against Jehovah, and departing from after our God, speaking violence and apostasy, they conceived and muttered from the heart words of falsehood.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And judgment was turned away behind, and justice shall stand from far off: for truth fainted in the street, and right will not be able to come in.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And truth shall be lacking; and he departing from evil being plundered: and Jehovah will see, and it will be evil in his eyes, for no judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he will see that not a man, and he will be astonished that none was supplicating: and his arm will save for him, and his justice it upheld him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he will put on justice as a coat of mail, and a helmet of salvation upon his head; and be will put on robes of vengeance a garment, and he will clothe himself with zeal as an upper garment.</verse>
  <verse number="18">According to the works, accordingly he will recompense, wrath to his adversaries, recompense, to his enemies; to the islands will he requite recompense.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And from the west they shall fear the name of Jehovah, and from the rising of the sun, his glory. When the adversary shall come in as a river, the spirit of Jehovah was lifted up against him.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And be redeeming came to Zion, and they turning away transgression in Jacob, says Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And I, this my covenant with them, said Jehovah: my spirit which is upon thee, and my word which I put in thy mouth shall not depart from thy mouth, and from the mouth of thy seed, from the mouth of thy seed’s seed, said Jehovah, from now and even forever.</verse>
