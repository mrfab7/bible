  <verse number="1">Then Job, answering, said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">I have often heard such things; you are all aggravating comforters.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Will there be no end to windy words? Or is it at all a burden to you, if you speak?</verse>
  <verse number="4">I, too, can speak like you; and I also wish that your soul favored my soul. I would also comfort you with speeches and would wag my head over you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I would strengthen you with my mouth, and would move my lips, as if being lenient to you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But what can I do? When I am speaking, my grief will not be quiet; and if I am quiet, it will not withdraw from me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But now my grief has crushed me, and all my limbs have been reduced to nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="8">My wrinkles bear witness against me, and a liar rises up against my face, contradicting me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He has gathered together his fury towards me, and, threatening me, he has roared against me with his teeth; my enemy has beheld me with terrible eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They have opened their mouths against me, and, reproaching me, they have struck me on the cheek; they are nourished by my sufferings.</verse>
  <verse number="11">God has confined me with the immoral, and he has delivered me into the hands of the impious.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I, who once was wealthy, am now crushed. He has grabbed me by my neck; he has broken me and has place me before him as a sign.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He has surrounded me with his lances. He has severely wounded my lower back, he has not been lenient, and he has poured out my organs upon the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He has cut me with wound after wound. He has rushed upon me like a giant.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I have sewn sackcloth over my skin, and I have covered my body with ashes.</verse>
  <verse number="16">My face is swollen from weeping, and my eyelids have dimmed my vision.</verse>
  <verse number="17">These things I have endured without iniquity in my hand, while I held pure prayers before God.</verse>
  <verse number="18">O earth, do not conceal my blood, nor let my outcry find a hiding place in you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For behold, my witness is in heaven, and my confidante is on high.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My friends are full of words; my eye rains tears upon God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And I wish that a man might be so judged before God, just as the son of man is judged with his assistant!</verse>
  <verse number="22">For behold, a few years pass by, and I am walking a path by which I will not return.</verse>
