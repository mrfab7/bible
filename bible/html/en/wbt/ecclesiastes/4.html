<p class="verse" data-verse="1">So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Wherefore I praised the dead who are already dead more than the living who are yet alive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Yes, better is he than both they, who hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Again, I considered all labor, and every right work, that for this a man is envied by his neighbor. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Better is a handful with quietness, than both the hands full with toil and vexation of spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">There is one alone, and there is not a second; yes, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labor; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labor, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yes, it is a grievous labor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him to rise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And if one prevaileth against him, two shall withstand him; and a three-fold cord is not quickly broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Better is a poor and a wise child, than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I considered all the living who walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</p>
