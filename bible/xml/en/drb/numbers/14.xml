  <verse number="1">Therefore the whole multitude crying wept that night.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Would God that we had died in Egypt and would God we may die in this vast wilderness, and that the Lord may not bring us into this land, lest we fall by the sword, and our wives and children be led away captives. Is it not better to return into Egypt?</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they said one to another: Let us appoint a captain, and let us return into Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And when Moses and Aaron heard this, they fell down flat upon the ground before the multitude of the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But Josue the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephone, who themselves also had viewed the land, rent their garments,</verse>
  <verse number="7">And said to all the multitude of the children of Israel: The land which we have gone round is very good:</verse>
  <verse number="8">If the Lord be favourable, he will bring us into it, and give us a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Be not rebellious against the Lord: and fear ye not the people of this land, for we are able to eat them up as bread. All aid is gone from them: the Lord is with us, fear ye not.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And when all the multitude cried out, and would have stoned them, the glory of the Lord appeared over the tabernacle of the covenant to all the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the Lord said to Moses: How long will this people detract me? how long will they not believe me for all the signs that I have wrought before them?</verse>
  <verse number="12">I will strike them therefore with pestilence, and will consume them: but thee I will make a ruler over a great nation, and a mightier than this is.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Moses said to the Lord: That the Egyptians, from the midst of whom thou hast brought forth this people,</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the inhabitants of this land, (who have heard that thou, O Lord, art among this people, and art seen face to face, and thy cloud protecteth them, and thou goest before them in a pillar of a cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night,)</verse>
  <verse number="15">May hear that thou hast killed so great a multitude as it were one man and may say:</verse>
  <verse number="16">He could not bring the people into the land for which he had sworn, therefore did he kill them in the wilderness.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Let their the strength of the Lord be magnified, as thou hast sworn, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="18">The Lord is patient and full of mercy, taking away iniquity and wickedness, and leaving no man clear, who visitest the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Forgive, I beseech thee, the sins of this people, according to the greatness of thy mercy, as thou hast been merciful to them from their going out of Egypt unto this place.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the Lord said: I have forgiven according to thy word.</verse>
  <verse number="21">As I live: and the whole earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But yet all the men that have seen my majesty, and the signs that I have done in Egypt, and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now ten times, and have not obeyed my voice,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Shall not see the land for which I aware to their fathers, neither shall any one of them that hath detracted me behold it.</verse>
  <verse number="24">My servant Caleb, who being full of another spirit hath followed me, I will bring into this land which he hath gone round: and his seed shall possess it.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For the Amalecite and the Chanaanite dwell in the valleys. To morrow remove the camp, and return into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="27">How long doth this wicked multitude murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Say therefore to them: As I live, saith the Lord: According as you have spoken in my hearing, so will I do to you.</verse>
  <verse number="29">fin the wilderness shall your carcasses lie. All you that were numbered from twenty years old and upward, and have murmured against me,</verse>
  <verse number="30">Shall not enter into the land, over which I lifted up my bend to make you dwell therein, except Caleb the son of Jephone, and Josue the son of Nun.</verse>
  <verse number="31">But your children, of whom you said, that they should be a prey to the enemies, will I bring in: that they may see the land which you have despised.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Your carcasses shall lie in the wilderness.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Your children shall wander in the desert forty years, and shall bear your fornication, until the carcasses of their fathers be consumed ill the desert,</verse>
  <verse number="34">According to the number of the forty days, wherein you viewed the land: a year shall be counted for a day. And forty years you shall receive your iniquities, and shall know my revenge:</verse>
  <verse number="35">For as I have spoken, so will I do to all this wicked multitude, that hath risen up together against me: in this wilderness shall it faint away and die.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Therefore all the men, whom Moses had sent to view the land, and who at their return had made the whole multitude to murmur against him, speaking ill of the land that it was naught,</verse>
  <verse number="37">Died and were struck in the sight of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="38">But Josue.the son of Nun. and Caleb the son of Jephone lived, of all them that had gone to view the land.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And Moses spoke all these words to all the children of Israel, and the people mourned exceedingly.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And behold rising up very early in the morning, they went up to the top of the mountain, and said: We are ready to go up to the place, of which the Lord hath spoken: for we have sinned.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And Moses said to them: Why transgress you the word of the Lord, which shall not succeed prosperously with you?</verse>
  <verse number="42">Go not up, for the Lord is not with you: lest you fall before your enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="43">The Amalecite and the Chanaanite are before you, and by their sword you shall fall, because you would not consent to the Lord, neither will the Lord be with you.</verse>
  <verse number="44">But they being blinded went up to the top of the mountain. But the ark of the testament of the Lord and Moses departed not from the camp.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And the Amalecite came down, and the Chanaanite that dwelt in the mountain: and smiting and slaying them pursued them as far as Horma.</verse>
