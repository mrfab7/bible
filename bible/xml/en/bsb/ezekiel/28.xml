  <verse number="1">And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Son of man, tell the ruler of Tyre that this is what the Lord GOD says: Your heart is proud, and you have said, ‘I am a god; I sit in the seat of gods in the heart of the sea.’ Yet you are a man and not a god, though you have regarded your heart as that of a god.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Behold, you are wiser than Daniel; no secret is hidden from you!</verse>
  <verse number="4">By your wisdom and understanding you have gained your wealth and amassed gold and silver for your treasuries.</verse>
  <verse number="5">By your great skill in trading you have increased your wealth, but your heart has grown proud because of it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Therefore this is what the Lord GOD says: Because you regard your heart as the heart of a god,</verse>
  <verse number="7">behold, I will bring foreigners against you, the most ruthless of nations. They will draw their swords against the beauty of your wisdom and will defile your splendor.</verse>
  <verse number="8">They will bring you down to the Pit, and you will die a violent death in the heart of the seas.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Will you still say, ‘I am a god,’ in the presence of those who slay you? You will be only a man, not a god, in the hands of those who wound you.</verse>
  <verse number="10">You will die the death of the uncircumcised at the hands of foreigners. For I have spoken, declares the Lord GOD.”</verse>
  <verse number="11">Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="12">“Son of man, take up a lament for the king of Tyre and tell him that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘You were the seal of perfection, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty.</verse>
  <verse number="13">You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every kind of precious stone adorned you: ruby, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and emerald. Your mountings and settings were crafted in gold, prepared on the day of your creation.</verse>
  <verse number="14">You were anointed as a guardian cherub, for I had ordained you. You were on the holy mountain of God; you walked among the fiery stones.</verse>
  <verse number="15">From the day you were created you were blameless in your ways—until wickedness was found in you.</verse>
  <verse number="16">By the vastness of your trade, you were filled with violence, and you sinned. So I drove you in disgrace from the mountain of God, and I banished you, O guardian cherub, from among the fiery stones.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Your heart grew proud of your beauty; you corrupted your wisdom because of your splendor; so I cast you to the earth; I made you a spectacle before kings.</verse>
  <verse number="18">By the multitude of your iniquities and the dishonesty of your trading you have profaned your sanctuaries. So I made fire come from within you, and it consumed you. I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the eyes of all who saw you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">All the nations who know you are appalled over you. You have come to a horrible end and will be no more.’”</verse>
  <verse number="20">Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="21">“Son of man, set your face against Sidon and prophesy against her.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And you are to declare that this is what the Lord GOD says: ‘Behold, I am against you, O Sidon, and I will be glorified within you. They will know that I am the LORD when I execute judgments against her and demonstrate My holiness through her.</verse>
  <verse number="23">I will send a plague against her and shed blood in her streets; the slain will fall within her, while the sword is against her on every side. Then they will know that I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For the people of Israel will no longer face a pricking brier or a painful thorn from all around them who treat them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the Lord GOD.’</verse>
  <verse number="25">This is what the Lord GOD says: ‘When I gather the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they have been scattered, I will show Myself holy among them in the sight of the nations. Then they will dwell in their own land, which I have given to My servant Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And there they will dwell securely, build houses, and plant vineyards. They will dwell securely when I execute judgments against all those around them who treat them with contempt. Then they will know that I am the LORD their God.’”</verse>
