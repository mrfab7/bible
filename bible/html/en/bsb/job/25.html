<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Dominion and awe belong to God; He establishes harmony in the heights of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Can His troops be numbered? On whom does His light not rise?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">How then can a man be just before God? How can one born of woman be pure?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If even the moon does not shine, and the stars are not pure in His sight,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">how much less man, who is but a maggot, and the son of man, who is but a worm!”</p>
