<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I ask then, did God reject His people? Certainly not! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">God did not reject His people, whom He foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says about Elijah, how he appealed to God against Israel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">“Lord, they have killed Your prophets and torn down Your altars. I am the only one left, and they are seeking my life as well”?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And what was the divine reply to him? “I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">In the same way, at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And if it is by grace, then it is no longer by works. Otherwise, grace would no longer be grace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">What then? What Israel was seeking, it failed to obtain, but the elect did. The others were hardened,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">as it is written: “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that could not see, and ears that could not hear, to this very day.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And David says: “May their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">May their eyes be darkened so they cannot see, and their backs be bent forever.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I ask then, did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery? Certainly not! However, because of their trespass, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make Israel jealous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But if their trespass means riches for the world, and their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much greater riches will their fullness bring!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch as I am the apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">in the hope that I may provoke my own people to jealousy and save some of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance be but life from the dead?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If the first part of the dough is holy, so is the whole batch; if the root is holy, so are the branches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Now if some branches have been broken off, and you, a wild olive shoot, have been grafted in among the others to share in the nourishment of the olive root,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">do not boast over those branches. If you do, remember this: You do not support the root, but the root supports you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">That is correct: They were broken off because of unbelief, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For if God did not spare the natural branches, He will certainly not spare you either.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Take notice, therefore, of the kindness and severity of God: severity to those who fell, but kindness to you, if you continue in His kindness. Otherwise you also will be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For if you were cut from a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into one that is cultivated, how much more readily will these, the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers, so that you will not be conceited: A hardening in part has come to Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles has come in.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And so all Israel will be saved, as it is written: “The Deliverer will come from Zion; He will remove godlessness from Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And this is My covenant with them when I take away their sins.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Regarding the gospel, they are enemies on your account; but regarding election, they are loved on account of the patriarchs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For God’s gifts and His call are irrevocable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Just as you who formerly disobeyed God have now received mercy through their disobedience,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">so they too have now disobeyed, in order that they too may now receive mercy through the mercy shown to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For God has consigned everyone to disobedience so that He may have mercy on everyone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">O, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgments, and untraceable His ways!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">“Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been His counselor?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">“Who has first given to God, that God should repay him?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever! Amen.</p>
