<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Call now; is there any that will answer thee? And to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For vexation killeth the foolish man, And jealousy slayeth the silly one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I have seen the foolish taking root: But suddenly I cursed his habitation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">His children are far from safety, And they are crushed in the gate, Neither is there any to deliver them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, And taketh it even out of the thorns; And the snare gapeth for their substance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For affliction cometh not forth from the dust, Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But man is born unto trouble, As the sparks fly upward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But as for me, I would seek unto God, And unto God would I commit my cause;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who doeth great things and unsearchable, Marvellous things without number:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who giveth rain upon the earth, And sendeth waters upon the fields;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">So that he setteth up on high those that are low, And those that mourn are exalted to safety.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He frustrateth the devices of the crafty, So that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; And the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">They meet with darkness in the day-time, And grope at noonday as in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But he saveth from the sword of their mouth, Even the needy from the hand of the mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">So the poor hath hope, And iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For he maketh sore, and bindeth up; He woundeth, and his hands make whole.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He will deliver thee in six troubles; Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In famine he will redeem thee from death; And in war from the power of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue; Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">At destruction and dearth thou shalt laugh; Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field; And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace; And thou shalt visit thy fold, and shalt miss nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, And thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, Like as a shock of grain cometh in in its season.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; Hear it, and know thou it for thy good.</p>
