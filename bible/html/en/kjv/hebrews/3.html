<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses [was faithful] in all his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For this [man] was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For every house is builded by some [man]; but he that built all things [is] God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Moses verily [was] faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in [their] heart; and they have not known my ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But with whom was he grieved forty years? [was it] not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</p>
