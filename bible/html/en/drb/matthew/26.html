<p class="verse" data-verse="1">AND it came to pass, when Jesus had ended all these words, he said to his disciples:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">You know that after two days shall be the pasch, and the son of man shall be delivered up to be crucified:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then were gathered together the chief priests and ancients of the people into the court of the high priest, who was called Caiphas:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they consulted together, that by subtilty they might apprehend Jesus, and put him to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But they said: Not on the festival day, lest perhaps there should be a tumult among the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And when Jesus was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of precious ointment, and poured it on his head as he was at table.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the disciples seeing it, had indignation, saying: To what purpose is this waste?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For this might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Jesus knowing it, said to them: Why do you trouble this woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the poor you have always with you: but me you have not always.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For she in pouring this ointment upon my body, hath done it for my burial.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Amen I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memory of her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then went one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, to the chief priests,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And said to them: What will you give me, and I will deliver him unto you? But they appointed him thirty pieces of silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And from thenceforth he sought opportunity to betray him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And on the first day of the Azymes, the disciples came to Jesus, saying: Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the pasch?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But Jesus said: Go ye into the city to a certain man, and say to him: the master saith, My time is near at hand, with thee I make the pasch with my disciples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the disciples did as Jesus appointed to them, and they prepared the pasch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But when it was evening, he sat down with his twelve disciples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And whilst they were eating, he said: Amen I say to you, that one of you is about to betray me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And they being very much troubled, began every one to say: Is it I, Lord?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But he answering, said: He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, he shall betray me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed: it were better for him, if that man had not been born.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Judas that betrayed him, answering, said: Is it I, Rabbi? He saith to him: Thou hast said it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And whilst they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke: and gave to his disciples, and said: Take ye, and eat. This is my body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And taking the chalice, he gave thanks, and gave to them, saying: Drink ye all of this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For this is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many unto remission of sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And I say to you, I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And a hymn being said, they went out unto mount Olivet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Then Jesus said to them: All you shall be scandalized in me this night. For it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be dispersed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And Peter answering, said to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, I will never be scandalized.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee, that in this night before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Peter saith to him: Yea, though I should die with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner said all the disciples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Then Jesus came with them into a country place which is called Gethsemani; and he said to his disciples: Sit you here, till I go yonder and pray.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to grow sorrowful and to be sad.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">Then he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death: stay you here, and watch with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And going a little further, he fell upon his face, praying, and saying: My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me. Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And he cometh to his disciples, and findeth them asleep, and he saith to Peter: What? Could you not watch one hour with me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Watch ye, and pray that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh weak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">Again the second time, he went and prayed, saying: My Father, if this chalice may not pass away, but I must drink it, thy will be done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And he cometh again and findeth them sleeping: for their eyes were heavy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And leaving them, he went again: and he prayed the third time, saying the selfsame word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Then he cometh to his disciples, and saith to them: Sleep ye now and take your rest; behold the hour is at hand, and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">Rise, let us go: behold he is at hand that will betray me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">As he yet spoke, behold Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the ancients of the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">And he that betrayed him, gave them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he, hold him fast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">And forthwith coming to Jesus, he said: Hail, Rabbi. And he kissed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">And Jesus said to him: Friend, whereto art thou come? Then they came up, and laid hands on Jesus, and held him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">And behold one of them that were with Jesus, stretching forth his hand, drew out his sword: and striking the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">Then Jesus saith to him: Put up again thy sword into its place: for all that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">Thinkest thou that I cannot ask my Father, and he will give me presently more than twelve legions of angels?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">How then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that so it must be done?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">In that same hour Jesus said to the multitudes: You are come out as it were to a robber with swords and clubs to apprehend me. I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you laid not hands on me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">Now all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then the disciples all leaving him, fled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="57">But they holding Jesus led him to Caiphas the high priest, where the scribes and the ancients were assembled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="58">And Peter followed him afar off, even to the court of the high priest. And going in, he sat with the servants, that he might see the end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="59">And the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="60">And they found not, whereas many false witnesses had come in. And last of all there came two false witnesses:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="61">And they said: This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and after three days to rebuild it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="62">And the high priest rising up, said to him: Answerest thou nothing to the things which these witness against thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="63">But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said to him: I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us if thou be the Christ the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="64">Jesus saith to him: Thou hast said it. Nevertheless I say to you, hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="65">Then the high priests rent his garments, saying: He hath blasphemed; what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="66">What think you? But they answering, said: He is guilty of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="67">Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him: and others struck his face with the palms of their hands,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="68">Saying: Prophesy unto us, O Christ, who is he that struck thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="69">But Peter sat without in the court: and there came to him a servant maid, saying: Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="70">But he denied before them all, saying: I know not what thou sayest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="71">And as he went out of the gate, another maid saw him, and she saith to them that were there: This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="72">And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="73">And after a little while they came that stood by, and said to Peter: Surely thou also art one of them; for even thy speech doth discover thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="74">Then he began to curse and to swear that he knew not the man. And immediately the cock crew.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="75">And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which he had said: Before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice. And going forth, he wept bitterly.</p>
