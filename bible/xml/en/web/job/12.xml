  <verse number="1">Then Job answered,</verse>
  <verse number="2">“No doubt, but you are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Yes, who doesn’t know such things as these?</verse>
  <verse number="4">I am like one who is a joke to his neighbor, I, who called on God, and he answered. The just, the blameless man is a joke.</verse>
  <verse number="5">In the thought of him who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune. It is ready for them whose foot slips.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The tents of robbers prosper. Those who provoke God are secure, who carry their God in their hands.</verse>
  <verse number="7">“But ask the animals, now, and they shall teach you; the birds of the sky, and they shall tell you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach you. The fish of the sea shall declare to you.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Who doesn’t know that in all these, the hand of Yahweh has done this,</verse>
  <verse number="10">in whose hand is the life of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Doesn’t the ear try words, even as the palate tastes its food?</verse>
  <verse number="12">With aged men is wisdom, in length of days understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="13">“With God is wisdom and might. He has counsel and understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Behold, he breaks down, and it can’t be built again. He imprisons a man, and there can be no release.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Behold, he withholds the waters, and they dry up. Again, he sends them out, and they overturn the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="16">With him is strength and wisdom. The deceived and the deceiver are his.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He leads counselors away stripped. He makes judges fools.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He loosens the bond of kings. He binds their waist with a belt.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He leads priests away stripped, and overthrows the mighty.</verse>
  <verse number="20">He removes the speech of those who are trusted, and takes away the understanding of the elders.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He pours contempt on princes, and loosens the belt of the strong.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He uncovers deep things out of darkness, and brings out to light the shadow of death.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He increases the nations, and he destroys them. He enlarges the nations, and he leads them captive.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth, and causes them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.</verse>
  <verse number="25">They grope in the dark without light. He makes them stagger like a drunken man.</verse>
