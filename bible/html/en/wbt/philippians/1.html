<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Being confident of this very thing, that he who hath begun a good work in you, will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For God is my witness, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened to me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And many of the brethren in the Lord, becoming confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Some indeed preach Christ even from envy and strife; and some also from good will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The one preach Christ from contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But the other from love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For I know that this will turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">According to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also, Christ will be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor: yet what I shall choose I know not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Nevertheless, to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">That your rejoicing for me may be more abundant in Jesus Christ by my coming to you again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Only let your manner of life be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that from God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For to you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</p>
