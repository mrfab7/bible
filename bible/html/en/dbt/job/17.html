<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are mine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Are there not mockers around me? and doth [not] mine eye abide in their provocation?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Lay down now [a pledge], be thou surety for me with thyself: who is he that striketh hands with me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For thou hast hidden their heart from understanding; therefore thou wilt not exalt [them].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He that betrayeth friends for a preyâ€”even the eyes of his children shall fail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he hath made me a proverb of the peoples; and I am become one to be spit on in the face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And mine eye is dim by reason of grief, and all my members are as a shadow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Upright men [shall be] astonished at this, and the innocent shall be stirred up against the ungodly;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But the righteous shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall increase in strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But as for you all, pray come on again; and I shall not find one wise man among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My days are past, my purposes are broken off, the cherished thoughts of my heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They change the night into day; the light [they imagine] near in presence of the darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I wait, Sheol is my house; I spread my bed in the darkness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I cry to the grave, Thou art my father! to the worm, My mother, and my sister!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And where is then my hope? yea, my hope, who shall see it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">It shall go down to the bars of Sheol, when [our] rest shall be together in the dust.</p>
