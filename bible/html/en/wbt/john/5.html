<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After this there was a feast of the Jews: and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue, Bethesda, having five porches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">In these lay a great multitude of impotent persons, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and agitated the water: whoever then first after the stirring of the water stepped in, was cured of whatever disease he had.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And a certain man was there, who had an infirmity thirty and eight years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith to him, Wilt thou be healed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is agitated, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Jesus saith to him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And immediately the man was healed, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The Jews therefore said to him that was cured, it is the sabbath; it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He answered them, He that healed me, the same said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Then they asked him, What man is that who said to thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And he that was healed knew not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou art cured: sin no more, lest a worse thing come to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And therefore the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Then answered Jesus, and said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son can do nothing by himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for whatever things he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and he will show him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For as the Father raiseth the dead, and reviveth them; even so the Son reviveth whom he will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For the Father judgeth no man; but hath committed all judgment to the Son:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">That all men should honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He that honoreth not the Son, honoreth not the Father who hath sent him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Verily, verily, I say to you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but hath passed from death to life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Verily, verily, I say to you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And shall come forth; they that have done good to the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of damnation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">I can of my own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father who hath sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">If I testify concerning myself, my testimony is not true.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">There is another that testifieth concerning me, and I know that the testimony which he beareth concerning me is true.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Ye sent to John, and he testified to the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye may be saved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">But I have greater testimony than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear testimony concerning me, that the Father hath sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And the Father himself who hath sent me, hath borne testimony concerning me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">I receive not honor from men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">I am come in my Fatherâ€™s name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">How can ye believe, who receive honor one from another, and seek not the honor that cometh from God only?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote concerning me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?</p>
