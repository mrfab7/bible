  <verse number="1">Dead flies cause the ointment of the perfumer to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly outweigh wisdom and honour.</verse>
  <verse number="2">A wise man’s heart is at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Yea also, when the fool walketh by the way, his understanding faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.</verse>
  <verse number="4">If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding allayeth great offences.</verse>
  <verse number="5">There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as it were an error which proceedeth from the ruler:</verse>
  <verse number="6">folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh through a fence, a serpent shall bite him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Whoso heweth out stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood is endangered thereby.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If the iron be blunt, and one do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If the serpent bite before it be charmed, then is there no advantage in the charmer.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.</verse>
  <verse number="14">A fool also multiplieth words: yet man knoweth not what shall be; and that which shall be after him, who can tell him?</verse>
  <verse number="15">The labour of fools wearieth every one of them, for he knoweth not how to go to the city.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!</verse>
  <verse number="17">Happy art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</verse>
  <verse number="18">By slothfulness the roof sinketh in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaketh.</verse>
  <verse number="19">A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh glad the life: and money answereth all things.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Curse not the king, no, not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</verse>
