<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="8" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Doth not wisdom cry, and understanding put forth her voice?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">In the top of high places by the way, where the paths meet, she standeth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">O ye simple, understand subtilty; and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Hear, for I will speak excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For my mouth shall utter truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing crooked or perverse in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared unto her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I wisdom have made subtilty my dwelling, and find out knowledge and discretion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge: I am understanding; I have might.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I love them that love me; and those that seek me diligently shall find me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, and that I may fill their treasuries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the beginning of the dust of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">When he established the heavens, I was there: when he set a circle upon the face of the deep:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">When he made firm the sides above: when the fountains of the deep became strong:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">When he gave to the sea its bound, that the waters should not transgress his commandment: when he marked out the foundations of the earth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Then I was by him, as a master workman: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Rejoicing in his habitable earth; and my delight was with the sons of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me: for blessed are they that keep my ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.</p>
