1	And Elihu will answer and say,
2	Didst thou reckon this for judgment thou saidst, My justice is above God?
3	For thou wilt say, What shall it profit to thee? what shall I profit from my sin?
4	I will turn back words to thee, and thy companions with thee.
5	Look upon the heavens and see; behold the clouds, they were high above thee.
6	If thou sinnedst, what wilt thou do against him? and thy transgressions were multiplied, what wilt thou do to him?
7	If thou wert just, what wilt thou give to him? or what shall he take from thy hand?
8	Thy injustice to a man as thou: and thy justice to the son of man.
9	From the multitude of oppressions they will cry out: they will cry out from the arm of the many.
10	And not saying, Where is God making me? he gave songs in the night.
11	And who teacheth us from the cattle of the earth, and he will make us wise above the birds of the heavens?
12	Then they will cry, and he will not answer from the face of the pride of the evil.
13	Also God will not hear vanity, and the Almighty will not look upon it.
14	Also if thou shalt say thou wilt not see him, judgment is before him, and thou shalt wait for him.
15	And now that it is not, he reviewed his anger, and he knew not in great transgression.
16	And Job will open his mouth in vain; he will bind together words without knowledge.
