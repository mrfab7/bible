  <verse number="1">So I exhort the Elders among you—I who am their fellow Elder and have been an eye-witness of the sufferings of the Christ, and am also a sharer in the glory which is soon to be revealed.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Be shepherds of God’s flock which is among you. Exercise the oversight not reluctantly but eagerly, in accordance with the will of God; not for base gain but with cheerful minds;</verse>
  <verse number="3">not lording it over your Churches but proving yourselves patterns for the flock to imitate.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And then, when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the never-withering wreath of glory.</verse>
  <verse number="5">In the same way you younger men must submit to your elders; and all of you must gird yourselves with humility towards one another, for God sets Himself against the proud, but gives grace to the humble.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Humble yourselves therefore beneath the mighty hand of God, so that at the right time He may set you on high.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Throw the whole of your anxiety upon Him, because He Himself cares for you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Curb every passion, and be on the alert. Your great accuser, the Devil, is going about like a roaring lion to see whom he can devour.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Withstand him, firm in your faith; knowing that your brethren in other parts of the world are passing through just the same experiences.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And God, the giver of all grace, who has called you to share His eternal glory, through Christ, after you have suffered for a short time, will Himself make you perfect, firm, and strong.</verse>
  <verse number="11">To Him be all power unto the Ages of the Ages! Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I send this short letter by Silas, our faithful brother—for such I regard him—in order to encourage you, and to bear witness that what I have told you is the true grace of God. In it stand fast.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The Church in Babylon, chosen like yourselves by God, sends greetings, and so does Mark my son.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be with all of you who are in Christ.</verse>
