<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After this I looked and saw a door standing open in heaven. And the voice I had previously heard speak to me like a trumpet was saying, “Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after these things.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">At once I was in the Spirit, and I saw a throne standing in heaven, with someone seated on it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The One seated there looked like jasper and carnelian, and a rainbow that gleamed like an emerald encircled the throne.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Surrounding the throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on these thrones sat twenty-four elders dressed in white, with golden crowns on their heads.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings, and peals of thunder. Before the throne burned seven torches of fire. These are the seven spirits of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And before the throne was something like a sea of glass, as clear as crystal. In the center, around the throne, were four living creatures, covered with eyes in front and back.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The first living creature was like a lion, the second like a calf, the third had a face like a man, and the fourth was like an eagle in flight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around and within. Day and night they never stop saying: “Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to the One seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">the twenty-four elders fall down before the One seated on the throne, and they worship Him who lives forever and ever. They cast their crowns before the throne, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">“Worthy are You, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for You created all things; by Your will they exist and were created.”</p>
