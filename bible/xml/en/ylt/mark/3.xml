  <verse number="1">And he entered again into the synagogue, and there was there a man having the hand withered,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and they were watching him, whether on the sabbaths he will heal him, that they might accuse him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he saith to the man having the hand withered, ‘Rise up in the midst.’</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he saith to them, ‘Is it lawful on the sabbaths to do good, or to do evil? life to save, or to kill?’ but they were silent.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And having looked round upon them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their heart, he saith to the man, ‘Stretch forth thy hand;’ and he stretched forth, and his hand was restored whole as the other;</verse>
  <verse number="6">and the Pharisees having gone forth, immediately, with the Herodians, were taking counsel against him how they might destroy him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Jesus withdrew with his disciples unto the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judea,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea and beyond the Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon—a great multitude—having heard how great things he was doing, came unto him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he said to his disciples that a little boat may wait on him, because of the multitude, that they may not press upon him,</verse>
  <verse number="10">for he did heal many, so that they threw themselves on him, in order to touch him—as many as had plagues;</verse>
  <verse number="11">and the unclean spirits, when they were seeing him, were falling down before him, and were crying, saying—‘Thou art the Son of God;’</verse>
  <verse number="12">and many times he was charging them that they might not make him manifest.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he goeth up to the mountain, and doth call near whom he willed, and they went away to him;</verse>
  <verse number="14">and he appointed twelve, that they may be with him, and that he may send them forth to preach,</verse>
  <verse number="15">and to have power to heal the sicknesses, and to cast out the demons.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he put on Simon the name Peter;</verse>
  <verse number="17">and James of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, and he put on them names—Boanerges, that is, ‘Sons of thunder;’</verse>
  <verse number="18">and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Cananite,</verse>
  <verse number="19">and Judas Iscariot, who did also deliver him up; and they come into a house.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And come together again doth a multitude, so that they are not able even to eat bread;</verse>
  <verse number="21">and his friends having heard, went forth to lay hold on him, for they said that he was beside himself,</verse>
  <verse number="22">and the scribes who are from Jerusalem having come down, said—‘He hath Beelzeboul,’ and—‘By the ruler of the demons he doth cast out the demons.’</verse>
  <verse number="23">And, having called them near, in similes he said to them, ‘How is the Adversary able to cast out the Adversary?</verse>
  <verse number="24">and if a kingdom against itself be divided, that kingdom cannot be made to stand;</verse>
  <verse number="25">and if a house against itself be divided, that house cannot be made to stand;</verse>
  <verse number="26">and if the Adversary did rise against himself, and hath been divided, he cannot be made to stand, but hath an end.</verse>
  <verse number="27">‘No one is able the vessels of the strong man—having entered into his house—to spoil, if first he may not bind the strong man, and then his house he will spoil.</verse>
  <verse number="28">‘Verily I say to you, that all the sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and evil speakings with which they might speak evil,</verse>
  <verse number="29">but whoever may speak evil in regard to the Holy Spirit hath not forgiveness—to the age, but is in danger of age-during judgment;’</verse>
  <verse number="30">because they said, ‘He hath an unclean spirit.’</verse>
  <verse number="31">Then come do his brethren and mother, and standing without, they sent unto him, calling him,</verse>
  <verse number="32">and a multitude was sitting about him, and they said to him, ‘Lo, thy mother and thy brethren without do seek thee.’</verse>
  <verse number="33">And he answered them, saying, ‘Who is my mother, or my brethren?’</verse>
  <verse number="34">And having looked round in a circle to those sitting about him, he saith, ‘Lo, my mother and my brethren!</verse>
  <verse number="35">for whoever may do the will of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and mother.’</verse>
