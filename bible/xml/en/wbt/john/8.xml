  <verse number="1">Jesus went to the mount of Olives:</verse>
  <verse number="2">And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him; and he sat down and taught them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman taken in adultery: and when they had set her in the midst,</verse>
  <verse number="4">They say to him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned; but what sayest thou?</verse>
  <verse number="6">This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</verse>
  <verse number="7">So when they continued asking him, he raised himself, and said to them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they who heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even to the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</verse>
  <verse number="10">When Jesus had raised himself, and saw none but the woman, he said to her, Woman, where are those thy accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</verse>
  <verse number="11">She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Then Jesus spoke again to them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The Pharisees therefore said to him, Thou testifiest concerning thyself; thy testimony is not true.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Jesus answered and said to them, Though I testify concerning myself, yet my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Ye judge after the flesh, I judge no man.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I am one that testifieth concerning myself; and the Father that sent me, testifieth concerning me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Then said they to him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye would have known my Father also.</verse>
  <verse number="20">These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him, for his hour was not yet come.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then said Jesus again to them, I am going away, and ye will seek me, and will die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Then said the Jews, will he kill himself? because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he said to them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</verse>
  <verse number="24">I said therefore to you, that ye will die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye will die in your sins.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then said they to him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith to them, Even the same that I said to you from the beginning.</verse>
  <verse number="26">I have many things to say, and to judge of you: but he that sent me, is true: and I speak to the world those things which I have heard from him.</verse>
  <verse number="27">They understood not that he spoke to them concerning the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then said Jesus to them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</verse>
  <verse number="30">As he spoke these words, many believed on him.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Then said Jesus to those Jews who believed on him, If ye continue in my word, ye are my disciples indeed;</verse>
  <verse number="32">And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</verse>
  <verse number="33">They answered him, We are Abraham’s offspring, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</verse>
  <verse number="34">Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Whoever committeth sin, is the servant of sin.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the servant abideth not in the house for ever, but the Son abideth for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="36">If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</verse>
  <verse number="37">I know that ye are Abraham’s offspring; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</verse>
  <verse number="38">I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</verse>
  <verse number="39">They answered and said to him, Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="40">But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard from God: this did not Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We are not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</verse>
  <verse number="42">Jesus said to them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do: he was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</verse>
  <verse number="46">Which of you convicteth me of sin? And if I speak the truth, why do ye not believe me?</verse>
  <verse number="47">He that is of God, heareth God’s words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</verse>
  <verse number="48">Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?</verse>
  <verse number="49">Jesus answered, I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and ye dishonor me.</verse>
  <verse number="50">And I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</verse>
  <verse number="51">Verily, verily, I say to you, If a man shall keep my saying, he shall never see death.</verse>
  <verse number="52">Then said the Jews to him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man shall keep my saying, he shall never taste death.</verse>
  <verse number="53">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</verse>
  <verse number="54">Jesus answered, If I honor myself, my honor is nothing: it is my Father that honoreth me, of whom ye say, that he is your God:</verse>
  <verse number="55">Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I should be a liar like you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</verse>
  <verse number="56">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.</verse>
  <verse number="57">Then said the Jews to him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</verse>
  <verse number="58">Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am.</verse>
  <verse number="59">Then they took up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</verse>
