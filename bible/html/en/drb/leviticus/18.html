<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: I am the Lord your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">You shall not do according to the custom of the land of Egypt, in which you dwelt: neither shall you act according to the manner of the country of Chanaan, into which I will bring you, nor shall you walk in their ordinances.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">You shall do my judgments, and shall observe my precepts, and shall walk in them. I am the Lord your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Keep my laws and my judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them. I am the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">No man shall approach to her that is near of kin to him, to uncover her nakedness. I am the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother: she is thy mother, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s wife: for it is the nakedness of thy father.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy son’s daughter, or thy daughter’s daughter: because it is thy own nakedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">11Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter, whom she bore to thy father, and who is thy sister.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s sister: because she is the flesh of thy father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister: because she is thy mother’s flesh.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy wife and her daughter. Thou shalt not take her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter, to discover her shame: because they are her flesh, and such copulation is incest.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thou shalt not approach to a woman having her flowers, neither shalt thou uncover her nakedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Thou shalt not lie with thy neighbour’s wife, nor be defiled with mingling of seed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Thou shalt not give any of thy seed to be consecrated to the idol Moloch, nor defile the name of thy God : I am the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind, because it is an abomination.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Thou shalt not copulate with any beast, neither shalt thou be defiled with it. A woman shall not lie down to a beast, nor copulate with it: because it is a heinous crime.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Defile not yourselves with any of these things with which all the nations have been defiled, which I will cast out before you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And with which the land is defiled: the abominations of which I will visit, that it may vomit out its inhabitants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Keep ye my ordinances and my judgments, and do not any of these abominations: neither any of your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For all these detestable things the inhabitants of the land have done, that; were before you, and have defiled it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Beware then, lest in like manner, it vomit you also out, if you do the like things, as it vomited out the nation that was before you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Every soul that shall commit any of these abominations, shall perish from the midst of his people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Keep my commandments. Do not the things which they have done, that have been before you, and be not defiled therein. I am the Lord your God.</p>
