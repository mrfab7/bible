<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wherefore thou art without excuse, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest dost practise the same things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And we know that the judgment of God is according to truth against them that practise such things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And reckonest thou this, O man, who judgest them that practise such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">but after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">who will render to every man according to his works:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">to them that by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honour and incorruption, eternal life:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">but unto them that are factious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness, shall be wrath and indignation,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">but glory and honour and peace to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">for there is no respect of persons with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned under law shall be judged by law;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">for not the hearers of a law are just before God, but the doers of a law shall be justified:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">for when Gentiles which have no law do by nature the things of the law, these, having no law, are a law unto themselves;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">in that they shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness therewith, and their thoughts one with another accusing or else excusing them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men, according to my gospel, by Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But if thou bearest the name of a Jew, and restest upon the law, and gloriest in God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">and knowest his will, and approvest the things that are excellent, being instructed out of the law,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">a corrector of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having in the law the form of knowledge and of the truth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">thou therefore that teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, dost thou rob temples?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">thou who gloriest in the law, through thy transgression of the law dishonourest thou God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you, even as it is written.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For circumcision indeed profiteth, if thou be a doer of the law: but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is become uncircumcision.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">If therefore the uncircumcision keep the ordinances of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">and shall not the uncircumcision which is by nature, if it fulfill the law, judge thee, who with the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</p>
