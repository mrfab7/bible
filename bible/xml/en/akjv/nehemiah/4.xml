  <verse number="1">But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we built the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he spoke before his brothers and the army of Samaria, and said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach on their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity:</verse>
  <verse number="5">And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before you: for they have provoked you to anger before the builders.</verse>
  <verse number="6">So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together to the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,</verse>
  <verse number="8">And conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the middle among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelled by them came, they said to us ten times, From all places from where you shall return to us they will be on you.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And I looked, and rose up, and said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not you afraid of them: remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and fight for your brothers, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to nothing, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one to his work.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants worked in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They which built on the wall, and they that bore burdens, with those that laded, every one with one of his hands worked in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so built. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And I said to the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated on the wall, one far from another.</verse>
  <verse number="20">In what place therefore you hear the sound of the trumpet, resort you thither to us: our God shall fight for us.</verse>
  <verse number="21">So we labored in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Likewise at the same time said I to the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and labor on the day.</verse>
  <verse number="23">So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing.</verse>
