1	And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
2	Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My oblation, my food for my offerings made by fire, of a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.
3	And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; he-lambs of the first year without blemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt offering.
4	The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;
5	and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil.
6	It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
7	And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou pour out a drink offering of strong drink unto the LORD.
8	And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meal offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
9	And on the sabbath day two he-lambs of the first year without blemish, and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:
10	this is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and the drink offering thereof.
11	And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven he-lambs of the first year without blemish;
12	and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, for each bullock; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, for the one ram;
13	and a several tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal offering unto every lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour, an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
14	And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine for a bullock, and the third part of an hin for the ram, and the fourth part of an hin for a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.
15	And one he-goat for a sin offering unto the LORD; it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and the drink offering thereof.
16	And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is the LORDâ€™S passover.
17	And on the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.
18	In the first day shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:
19	but ye shall offer an offering made by fire, a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven he-lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without blemish:
20	and their meal offering, fine flour mingled with oil: three tenth parts shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth parts for the ram;
21	a several tenth part shalt thou offer for every lamb of the seven lambs;
22	and one he-goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you.
23	Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering.
24	After this manner ye shall offer daily, for seven days, the food of the offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and the drink offering thereof.
25	And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.
26	Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye offer a new meal offering unto the LORD in your feast of weeks, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:
27	but ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven he-lambs of the first year;
28	and their meal offering, fine flour mingled with oil, three tenth parts for each bullock, two tenth parts for the one ram,
29	a several tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;
30	one he-goat, to make atonement for you.
31	Beside the continual burnt offering, and the meal offering thereof, ye shall offer them (they shall be unto you without blemish), and their drink offerings.
