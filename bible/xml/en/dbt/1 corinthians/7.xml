<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="7" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But concerning the things of which ye have written [to me]: [It is] good for a man not to touch a woman;</verse>
  <verse number="2">but on account of fornications, let each have his own wife, and each [woman] have her own husband.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Let the husband render her due to the wife, and in like manner the wife to the husband.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The wife has not authority over her own body, but the husband: in like manner also the husband has not authority over his own body, but the wife.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Defraud not one another, unless, it may be, by consent for a time, that ye may devote yourselves to prayer, and again be together, that Satan tempt you not because of your incontinency.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But this I say, as consenting [to], not as commanding [it].</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now I wish all men to be even as myself: but every one has his own gift of God: one man thus, and another thus.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, It is good for them that they remain even as I.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But if they have not control over themselves, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But to the married I enjoin, not I, but the Lord, Let not wife be separated from husband;</verse>
  <verse number="11">(but if also she shall have been separated, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband;) and let not husband leave wife.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But as to the rest, I say, not the Lord, If any brother have an unbelieving wife, and she consent to dwell with him, let him not leave her.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And a woman who has an unbelieving husband, and he consents to dwell with her, let her not leave [her] husband.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For the unbelieving husband is sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified in the brother; since [otherwise] indeed your children are unclean, but now they are holy.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But if the unbeliever go away, let them go away; a brother or a sister is not bound in such [cases], but God has called us in peace.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For what knowest thou, O wife, if thou shalt save thy husband? or what knowest thou, O husband, if thou shalt save thy wife?</verse>
  <verse number="17">However, as the Lord has divided to each, as God has called each, so let him walk; and thus I ordain in all the assemblies.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Has any one been called circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised: has any one been called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing; but keeping God’s commandments.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Let each abide in that calling in which he has been called.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Hast thou been called [being] a bondman, let it not concern thee; but and if thou canst become free, use [it] rather.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For the bondman that is called in [the] Lord is the Lord’s freedman; in like manner [also] the freeman being called is Christ’s bondman.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Ye have been bought with a price; do not be the bondmen of men.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Let each, wherein he is called, brethren, therein abide with God.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But concerning virgins, I have no commandment of [the] Lord; but I give my opinion, as having received mercy of [the] Lord to be faithful.</verse>
  <verse number="26">I think then that this is good, on account of the present necessity, that [it is] good for a man to remain so as he is.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Art thou bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed; art thou free from a wife? do not seek a wife.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But if thou shouldest also marry, thou hast not sinned; and if the virgin marry, they have not sinned: but such shall have tribulation in the flesh; but I spare you.</verse>
  <verse number="29">But this I say, brethren, the time is straitened. For the rest, that they who have wives, be as not having [any]:</verse>
  <verse number="30">and they that weep, as not weeping; and they that rejoice, as not rejoicing; and they that buy, as not possessing;</verse>
  <verse number="31">and they that use the world, as not disposing of it as their own; for the fashion of this world passes.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But I wish you to be without care. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, how he shall please the Lord;</verse>
  <verse number="33">but he that has married cares for the things of the world, how he shall please his wife.</verse>
  <verse number="34">There is a difference between the wife and the virgin. The unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit; but she that has married cares for the things of the world, how she shall please her husband.</verse>
  <verse number="35">But I say this for your own profit; not that I may set a snare before you, but for what [is] seemly, and waiting on the Lord without distraction.</verse>
  <verse number="36">But if any one think that he behaves unseemly to his virginity, if he be beyond the flower of his age, and so it must be, let him do what he will, he does not sin: let them marry.</verse>
  <verse number="37">But he who stands firm in his heart, having no need, but has authority over his own will, and has judged this in his heart to keep his own virginity, he does well.</verse>
  <verse number="38">So that he that marries himself does well; and he that does not marry does better.</verse>
  <verse number="39">A wife is bound for whatever time her husband lives; but if the husband be fallen asleep, she is free to be married to whom she will, only in [the] Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="40">But she is happier if she so remain, according to my judgment; but I think that I also have God’s Spirit.</verse>
