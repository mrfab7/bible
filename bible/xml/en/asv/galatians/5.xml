<chapter book="Galatians" number="5" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">For freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Behold, I Paul say unto you, that, if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Yea, I testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Ye are severed from Christ, ye who would be justified by the law; ye are fallen away from grace.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Ye were running well; who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth?</verse>
  <verse number="8">This persuasion came not of him that calleth you.</verse>
  <verse number="9">A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I have confidence to you-ward in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For ye, brethren, were called for freedom; only use not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through love be servants one to another.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But I say, Walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other; that ye may not do the things that ye would.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</verse>
  <verse number="20">idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousies, wraths, factions, divisions, parties,</verse>
  <verse number="21">envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</verse>
  <verse number="23">meekness, self-control; against such there is no law.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And they that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="25">If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.</verse>
