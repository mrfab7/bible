  <verse number="1">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Make you two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shall you make them: that you may use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to you at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves to you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">When you blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.</verse>
  <verse number="6">When you blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But when the congregation is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And if you go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresses you, then you shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and you shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And they first took their journey according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="14">In the first place went the standard of the camp of the children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was Nethaneel the son of Zuar.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of Shedeur.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the other did set up the tabernacle against they came.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies: and over his host was Elishama the son of Ammihud.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set forward, which was the rear guard of all the camps throughout their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel the son of Ocran.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Thus were the journeys of the children of Israel according to their armies, when they set forward.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses’ father in law, We are journeying to the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come you with us, and we will do you good: for the LORD has spoken good concerning Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And he said to him, I will not go; but I will depart to my own land, and to my kindred.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And he said, Leave us not, I pray you; for as much as you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and you may be to us instead of eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And it shall be, if you go with us, yes, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do to us, the same will we do to you.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days’ journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days’ journey, to search out a resting place for them.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And the cloud of the LORD was on them by day, when they went out of the camp.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said, Rise up, LORD, and let your enemies be scattered; and let them that hate you flee before you.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, to the many thousands of Israel.</verse>
