  <verse number="6">Folly was given to great heights, and the rich were set in lowness.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I saw servants upon horses, and chiefs going as servants upon the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He digging a ditch shall fall into it; he breaking down a wall, a serpent shall bite him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He removing stones; shall suffer pain by them; and he cleaving woods asunder shall be endangered by them.</verse>
