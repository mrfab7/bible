<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The wicked flee when no man pursueth; but the righteous are bold as a lion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">By the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof; but by a man of understanding [and] of knowledge, [its] stability is prolonged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A poor man who oppresseth the helpless is a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They that forsake the law praise the wicked; but such as keep the law contend with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Evil men understand not judgment; but they that seek Jehovah understand everything.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse, double in ways, though he be rich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Whoso observeth the law is a son that hath understanding; but he that is a companion of profligates bringeth shame to his father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance gathereth it for him that is gracious to the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Whoso causeth the upright to go astray in an evil way, shall himself fall into his own pit; but the perfect shall inherit good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">A rich man is wise in his own eyes; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When the righteous triumph, there is great glory; but when the wicked rise, men conceal themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He that covereth his transgressions shall not prosper; but whoso confesseth and forsaketh [them] shall obtain mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Happy is the man that feareth always; but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">A roaring lion, and a ranging bear, is a wicked ruler over a poor people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The prince void of intelligence is also a great oppressor: he that hateth covetousness shall prolong [his] days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A man laden with the blood of [any] person, fleeth to the pit: let no man stay him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Whoso walketh in integrity shall be saved; but he that is perverted in [his] double ways, shall fall in one [of them].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread; but he that followeth the worthless shall have poverty enough.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A faithful man aboundeth with blessings; but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">To have respect of persons is not good; but for a piece of bread will a man transgress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He that hath an evil eye hasteth after wealth, and knoweth not that poverty shall come upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He that rebuketh a man shall afterwards find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Whoso robbeth his father and his mother, and saith, It is no transgression, the same is the companion of a destroyer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He that is puffed up in soul exciteth contention; but he that relieth upon Jehovah shall be made fat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He that confideth in his own heart is a fool; but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack; but he that withdraweth his eyes shall have many a curse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">When the wicked rise, men hide themselves; but when they perish, the righteous increase.</p>
