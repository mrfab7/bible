<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="8" data-translation="Darby Bible Translation" data-translation-id="dbt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding give forth her voice?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">On the top of high places by the way, at the cross-paths she taketh her stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Unto you, men, I call, and my voice is to the sons of man:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">O ye simple, understand prudence; and ye foolish, understand sense.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Hear, for I will speak excellent things, and the opening of my lips shall be right things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For my palate shall meditate truth, and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing tortuous or perverse in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">for wisdom is better than rubies, and all the things that may be desired are not equal to it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I wisdom dwell [with] prudence, and find the knowledge [which cometh] of reflection.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil; pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth do I hate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am intelligence; I have strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">By me kings reign, and rulers make just decrees;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">by me princes rule, and nobles, all the judges of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I love those that love me; and they that seek me early shall find me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Riches and honour are with me; durable wealth and righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">My fruit is better than fine gold, yea, than pure gold; and my revenue than choice silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I walk in the path of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">that I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasuries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">I was set up from eternity, from the beginning, before the earth was.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">When there were no depths, I was brought forth, when there were no fountains abounding with water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the beginning of the dust of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">When he prepared the heavens I was there; when he ordained the circle upon the face of the deep;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">when he established the skies above, when the fountains of the deep became strong;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">when he imposed on the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment, when he appointed the foundations of the earth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">then I was by him [his] nursling, and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth, and my delights [were] with the sons of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And now, sons, hearken unto me, and blessed are they that keep my ways:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">hear instruction and be wise, and refuse it not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">For whoso findeth me findeth life, and obtaineth favour of Jehovah;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">but he that sinneth against me doeth violence to his own soul: all they that hate me love death.</p>
