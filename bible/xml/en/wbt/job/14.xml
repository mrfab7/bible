<chapter book="Job" number="14" translation="Webster Bible Translation" translationID="wbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Man that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And dost thou open thy eyes upon such one, and bring me into judgment with thee?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months is with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;</verse>
  <verse number="6">Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For there is hope of a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its tender branch will not cease.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Though its root shall become old in the earth, and its stock die in the ground;</verse>
  <verse number="9">Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But man dieth, and wasteth away: yes, man yieldeth his breath, and where is he?</verse>
  <verse number="11">As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:</verse>
  <verse number="12">So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens shall be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.</verse>
  <verse number="13">O that thou wouldst hide me in the grave, that thou wouldst keep me secret, until thy wrath is past, that thou wouldst appoint me a set time, and remember me!</verse>
  <verse number="14">If a man dieth, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change shall come.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thy hands.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?</verse>
  <verse number="17">My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up my iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And surely the mountain falling cometh to naught, and the rock is removed out of its place.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.</verse>
  <verse number="21">His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.</verse>
