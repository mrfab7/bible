  <verse number="5">And thou shalt take fine wheaten flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof; each cake shall be of two tenths.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And thou shalt set them in two rows, six in a row, upon the pure table before Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row; and it shall be a bread of remembrance, an offering by fire to Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Every sabbath day he shall arrange it before Jehovah continually, on the part of the children of Israel: [it is] an everlasting covenant.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And it shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; and they shall eat it in a holy place; for it is most holy unto him of Jehovah’s offerings by fire: [it is] an everlasting statute.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the son of an Israelitish woman—but withal the son of an Egyptian,—went out among the children of Israel; and this son of the Israelitess and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;</verse>
  <verse number="11">and the Israelitish woman’s son blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him to Moses. And his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they confined him, that they might decide at the mouth of Jehovah.</verse>

  <verse number="14">Lead the reviler outside the camp; and all that heard [him] shall lay their hands upon his head, and the whole assembly shall stone him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Every one when he revileth his God shall bear his sin.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he that blasphemeth the name of Jehovah shall certainly be put to death; all the assembly shall certainly stone him; as well the stranger as he that is home-born, when he blasphemeth the Name, shall be put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And if any one smiteth any man mortally, he shall certainly be put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he that smiteth a beast mortally shall make it good, life for life.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour, as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;</verse>
  <verse number="20">breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He that smiteth a beast [mortally] shall make it good; and he that smiteth a man [mortally] shall be put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Ye shall have one law: as the stranger, so the home-born; for I am Jehovah your God.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they led the reviler outside the camp and stoned him with stones. And the children of Israel did as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</verse>
