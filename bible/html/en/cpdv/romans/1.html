<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called as an Apostle, separated for the Gospel of God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">which he had promised beforehand, through his Prophets, in the Holy Scriptures,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">about his Son, who was made for him from the offspring of David according to the flesh,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">the Son of God, who was predestined in virtue according to the Spirit of sanctification from the resurrection of the dead, our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">through whom we have received grace and Apostleship, for the sake of his name, for the obedience of faith among all the Gentiles,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">from whom you also have been called by Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">To all who are at Rome, the beloved of God, called as saints. Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Certainly, I give thanks to my God, through Jesus Christ, first for all of you, because your faith is being announced throughout the entire world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit by the Gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I have kept a remembrance of you</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">always in my prayers, pleading that in some way, at some time, I may have a prosperous journey, within the will of God, to come to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you a certain spiritual grace to strengthen you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">specifically, to be consoled together with you through that which is mutual: your faith and mine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But I want you to know, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you, (though I have been hindered even to the present time) so that I might obtain some fruit among you also, just as also among the other Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">To the Greeks and to the uncivilized, to the wise and to the foolish, I am in debt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">So within me there is a prompting to evangelize to you also who are at Rome.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For I am not ashamed of the Gospel. For it is the power of God unto salvation for all believers, the Jew first, and the Greek.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the justice of God is revealed within it, by faith unto faith, just as it was written: “For the just one lives by faith.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven over every impiety and injustice among those men who fend off the truth of God with injustice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For what is known about God is manifest in them. For God has manifested it to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For unseen things about him have been made conspicuous, since the creation of the world, being understood by the things that were made; likewise his everlasting virtue and divinity, so much so that they have no excuse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For although they had known God, they did not glorify God, nor give thanks. Instead, they became weakened in their thoughts, and their foolish heart was obscured.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For, while proclaiming themselves to be wise, they became foolish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And they exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of flying things, and of four-legged beasts, and of serpents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For this reason, God handed them over to the desires of their own heart for impurity, so that they afflicted their own bodies with indignities among themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And they exchanged the truth of God for a lie. And they worshipped and served the creature, rather than the Creator, who is blessed for all eternity. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Because of this, God handed them over to shameful passions. For example, their females have exchanged the natural use of the body for a use which is against nature.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And similarly, the males also, abandoning the natural use of females, have burned in their desires for one another: males doing with males what is disgraceful, and receiving within themselves the recompense that necessarily results from their error.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And since they did not prove to have God by knowledge, God handed them over to a morally depraved way of thinking, so that they might do those things which are not fitting:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">having been completely filled with all iniquity, malice, fornication, avarice, wickedness; full of envy, murder, contention, deceit, spite, gossiping;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">slanderous, hateful toward God, abusive, arrogant, self-exalting, devisers of evil, disobedient to parents,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">foolish, disorderly; without affection, without fidelity, without mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And these, though they had known the justice of God, did not understand that those who act in such a manner are deserving of death, and not only those who do these things, but also those who consent to what is done.</p>
