<chapter book="Isaiah" number="42" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.</verse>
  <verse number="3">A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment to truth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thus said God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which comes out of it; he that gives breath to the people on it, and spirit to them that walk therein:</verse>
  <verse number="6">I the LORD have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand, and will keep you, and give you for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;</verse>
  <verse number="7">To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Sing to the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, you that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar does inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Let them give glory to the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yes, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I have long time held my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do to them, and not forsake them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, You are our gods.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Hear, you deaf; and look, you blind, that you may see.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD’s servant?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Seeing many things, but you observe not; opening the ears, but he hears not.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness’ sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honorable.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivers; for a spoil, and none said, Restore.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Who among you will give ear to this? who will listen and hear for the time to come?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient to his law.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Therefore he has poured on him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it has set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.</verse>
