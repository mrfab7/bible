<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And I say, for as long time as the heir is a child, he differs nothing from a servant, being lord of all;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">But is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">So also we, when we were children, were subjugated under the worldâ€™s elements:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And when the completion of the time was come, God sent his Son, born of woman, born under the law,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">That he might redeem them under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">So that thou art no more a servant, but a son: and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But then truly, not having known God, ye were in a servile condition to them not being gods by nature.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And now, having known God, and rather known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and poor elements, to which again ye wish anew to be in a servile condition.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Ye observe narrowly days, and months, and times, and years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I am afraid of you, lest I have been wearied for you in vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Be ye as I, for I also as you, brethren, I pray you: ye injured me nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And ye know that through weakness of the flesh I announced the good news to you before.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And my temptation in my flesh, ye counted not as nothing, nor spurned; but as an angel of God ye received me, as Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">What then was your happiness? for I testify to you, that, if possible, having plucked out your eyes, ye would have given to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Have I then been your enemy, speaking truth to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">They are zealous for you, not well; but they wish to exclude you, that ye might be zealous for them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And good to be zealous always in good, and not only in my being present with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">My children, for whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And I would be present with you now, and change my voice; for I am perplexed about you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Tell me, those wishing to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For it has been written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondmaid, and one by the free.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But he truly of the bondmaid was born according to the flesh; and he of the free through the promise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Which things are spoken figuratively: for these are the two covenants; one truly from mount Sinai, begetting to bondage, which is Agar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and now stands in the same rank With Jerusalem, and is in a servile condition with her children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But Jerusalem above is free, which is mother of us all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For it has been written, Be cheered, O barren, bearing not; break out and cry, she travailing not: for many more the children of the desolate than she having a husband.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And we, brethren, as Isaac, are children of promise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">But as then he born according to the flesh drove out him according to the Spirit, so also now.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">But what says the writing? Cast out the bondmaid and her son; for the son of the bondmaid shall not inherit with the son of the free.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Therefore, brethren, we are not children of the bondmaid, but of the free.</p>
