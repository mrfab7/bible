<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And they will bind on the breastplate by its rings to the rings of the ephod, by a thread of cerulean purple, to be upon the girdle of the ephod, and the breast-plate shall not be moved from the ephod; as Jehovah commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And he will make the robe of the ephod a woven work, all cerulean purple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And the mouth of the robe in the midst of it as the mouth of a coat of mail, a lip to its mouth round about, it shall not rend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And they will make upon the skirts of the robe, pomegranates, cerulean purple, and red purple, and twined double scarlet.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And they will make a brightness, a diadem of the holy place of pure gold, and they will write upon it a writing, the engravings for a seal, HOLY TO JEHOVAH.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And they will set upon it a thread cerulean purple to give upon the turban from above; as Jehovah commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And all the work of the dwelling of the tent of appointment will be completed: and the sons of Israel will do according to all which Jehovah commanded Moses: thus did they.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And they will bring the dwelling to Moses, the tent and all its vessels; its hooks, its boards, its bars, and its pillars, and its bases;</p>
