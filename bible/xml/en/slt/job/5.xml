  <verse number="1">Call now, if there is answering thee; and to whom from the holy ones wilt thou turn?</verse>
  <verse number="2">For to the foolish, and anger will slay, and the simple will jealousy kill.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I saw the foolish one taking root, and suddenly I shall curse his habitation.</verse>
  <verse number="4">His sons shall be far from salvation, and they shall be crushed in the gate, and none delivering.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Which his harvest the hungry one will devour, and not from thorns shall they take it, and destruction gaped after their substance.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For toil will not come forth from the dust, and labor will not spring up from the earth;</verse>
  <verse number="7">For man shall be born to labor as the sons of the flame will lift up to fly.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But I will seek to God, and to God set my cause:</verse>
  <verse number="9">He did great things, and no searching; and wonders even no number:</verse>
  <verse number="10">He gave rain upon the face of the earth, and sent waters upon the out places:</verse>
  <verse number="11">To raise up the humbled to height; and those mourning were exalted to salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Bringing to nought the purposes of the crafty, and their hand shall not do an undertaking.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He took the wise in their craftiness, and the counsel of the perverse was headlong.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The days they will meet darkness, and they will grope in the noon day as night.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he saved the needy from the sword, from their mouth and from the band of the strong one.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And hope will be to the poor one, and iniquity contracted her mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Behold, happy the man God shall rebuke him: and thou shalt not reject the correction of the Almighty:</verse>
  <verse number="18">For he will cause pain, and he will bind up: he will smite and his hands will heal.</verse>
  <verse number="19">In six straits he will deliver thee, and in seven, evil shall not touch upon thee.</verse>
  <verse number="20">In famine he redeemed thee from death, and in war from the hands of the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="21">In the scourge of the tongue thou shalt be hid, and thou shalt not be afraid of desolation when it shall come.</verse>
  <verse number="22">At desolation and at hunger thou shalt laugh, and from the beasts of the earth thou shalt not fear.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For with the stones of the field they covenant, and the beast of the field was at peace with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And thou knewest that thy tent is peace, and thou reviewedst thy dwelling, and thou shalt not sin.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And thou knewest the multitude of thy seed, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Thou shalt come in old age to thy grave, as the ascending of a heap of sheaves in its time.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Behold this, we searched it out, so it is: hear it, and know thou for thyself.</verse>
