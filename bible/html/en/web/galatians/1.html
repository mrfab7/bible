<div class="chapter" data-book="Galatians" data-chapter="1" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and all the brothers who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different “good news”;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and there isn’t another “good news.” Only there are some who trouble you, and want to pervert the Good News of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any “good news” other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any “good news” other than that which you received, let him be cursed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn’t be a servant of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother’s womb, and called me through his grace,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn’t immediately confer with flesh and blood,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But of the other apostles I saw no one, except James, the Lord’s brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now about the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I’m not lying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">but they only heard: “He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And they glorified God in me.</p>
