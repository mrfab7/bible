<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do [it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare [it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: [but] thou hast kept the good wine until now.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But he spake of the temple of his body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast [day], many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all [men],</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.</p>
