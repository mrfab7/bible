<chapter book="Joshua" number="18" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Then the whole congregation of Israel assembled at Shiloh and set up the Tent of Meeting there. And though the land was subdued before them,</verse>
  <verse number="2">there were still seven tribes of Israel who had not yet received their inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="3">So Joshua said to the Israelites, “How long will you put off entering and possessing the land that the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Appoint three men from each tribe, and I will send them out to survey the land and map it out, according to the inheritance of each. Then they will return to me</verse>
  <verse number="5">and divide the land into seven portions. Judah shall remain in their territory in the south, and the house of Joseph shall remain in their territory in the north.</verse>
  <verse number="6">When you have mapped out the seven portions of land and brought it to me, I will cast lots for you here in the presence of the LORD our God.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The Levites, however, have no portion among you, because their inheritance is the priesthood of the LORD. And Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh have already received the inheritance that Moses the servant of the LORD gave them beyond the Jordan to the east.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">As the men got up to go out, Joshua commanded them to map out the land, saying, “Go and survey the land, map it out, and return to me. Then I will cast lots for you here in Shiloh in the presence of the LORD.”</verse>
  <verse number="9">So the men departed and went throughout the land, mapping it city by city into seven portions. Then they returned with the document to Joshua at the camp in Shiloh.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Joshua cast lots for them in the presence of the LORD at Shiloh, where he distributed the land to the Israelites according to their divisions.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The first lot came up for the clans of the tribe of Benjamin. Their allotted territory lay between the tribes of Judah and Joseph:</verse>
  <verse number="12">On the north side their border began at the Jordan, went up past the northern slope of Jericho, headed west through the hill country, and came out at the wilderness of Beth-aven.</verse>
  <verse number="13">From there the border crossed over to the southern slope of Luz (that is, Bethel) and went down to Ataroth-addar on the hill south of Lower Beth-horon.</verse>
  <verse number="14">On the west side the border curved southward from the hill facing Beth-horon on the south and came out at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city of the sons of Judah. This was the western side.</verse>
  <verse number="15">On the south side the border began at the outskirts of Kiriath-jearim and extended westward to the spring at the Waters of Nephtoah.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then it went down to the foot of the hill that faces the Valley of Ben-hinnom at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim and ran down the Valley of Hinnom toward the southern slope of the Jebusites and downward to En-rogel.</verse>
  <verse number="17">From there it curved northward and proceeded to En-shemesh and on to Geliloth facing the Ascent of Adummim, and continued down to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Then it went on to the northern slope of Beth-arabah and went down into the valley.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The border continued to the northern slope of Beth-hoglah and came out at the northern bay of the Salt Sea, at the mouth of the Jordan. This was the southern border.</verse>
  <verse number="20">On the east side the border was the Jordan. These were the borders around the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
  <verse number="21">These were the cities of the clans of the tribe of Benjamin: Jericho, Beth-hoglah, Emek-keziz,</verse>
  <verse number="22">Beth-arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Avvim, Parah, Ophrah,</verse>
  <verse number="24">Chephar-ammoni, Ophni, and Geba—twelve cities, along with their villages.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth,</verse>
  <verse number="26">Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah,</verse>
  <verse number="27">Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah,</verse>
  <verse number="28">Zelah, Haeleph, Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah, and Kiriath-jearim—fourteen cities, along with their villages. This was the inheritance of the clans of the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
