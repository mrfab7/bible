<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Aye, my heart trembleth at this also, and leapeth up out of its place:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear attentively the roar of his voice, and the murmur going forth from his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency, and holdeth not back the flashes when his voice is heard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">God thundereth marvellously with his voice, doing great things which we do not comprehend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For he saith to the snow, Fall on the earth! and to the pouring rain, even the pouring rains of his might.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the wild beast goeth into its lair, and they remain in their dens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">From the chamber [of the south] cometh the whirlwind; and cold from the winds of the north.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">By the breath of God ice is given; and the breadth of the waters is straitened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Also with plentiful moisture he loadeth the thick clouds, his light dispels the cloud;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And they are turned every way by his guidance, that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the circuit of the earth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whether he cause it to come as a rod, or for his land, or in mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Hearken unto this, Job; stand still and discern the wondrous works of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Dost thou know how +God hath disposed them, and how he causeth the lightning of his cloud to flash?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Dost thou know about the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him that is perfect in knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">How thy garments become warm when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Hast thou with him spread out the sky, firm, like a molten mirror?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Teach us what we shall say unto him! We cannot order [our words] by reason of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Shall it be told him if I would speak? if a man [so] say, surely he shall be swallowed up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And now [men] see not the light as it gleameth, it is [hidden] in the skies. But the wind passeth by and cleareth them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">From the north cometh gold; with +God is terrible majesty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The Almighty, we cannot find him out: excellent in power, and in judgment, and in abundance of justice, he doth not afflict.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.</p>
