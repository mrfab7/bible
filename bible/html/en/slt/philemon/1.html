<p class="verse" data-verse="1">PAUL, imprisoned of Jesus Christ, Timothy the brother, to Philemon, dearly beloved, and cooperating,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And to the dearly beloved Apphia, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and the church in thy house:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I thank my God, always making remembrance of thee in my prayers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast to the Lord Jesus, and to all the holy;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">So that the mutual participation of thy faith might be effective in acknowledgment of every good in you to Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For we have much grace and consolation upon thy love, for the bowels of the holy are refreshed by thee, brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Wherefore, having much freedom of speech in Christ to enjoin thee what concerns thee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">By love I beseech rather, being such as Paul an aged man, and now also the imprisoned of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I beseech thee for my child whom I begat in my bonds, Onesimus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Once unprofitable to thee, but now more profitable to thee and to me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Whom I sent back: and thou him, that is, my bowels, receive again:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whom I was wishing to retain to myself, that for thee he might serve me in the bonds of the good news:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But without thy judgment I would do nothing; that good might not be as according to necessity, but according to free will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For perhaps therefore he was separated for a time, that thou mightest receive him forever;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">No more as a servant, but above a servant, a dearly beloved brother, especially to me, and how much rather to thee, also in the flesh, and in the Lord?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If therefore thou hold me a participator, receive him in addition as me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And if he injured thee any, or is indebted, charge this to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I Paul wrote with my hand, I will pay back: that I say not to thee, for thou owest thyself to me also in addition.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Yea, brother, may I be profited by thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote to thee, knowing that thou wilt do above what I say to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And at the same time also prepare for me a reception as a guest: for I hope that by your prayers I shall be given as a favor to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Epaphras greets thee, my fellow-captive in Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my co-workers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with your spirit. Amen.</p>
