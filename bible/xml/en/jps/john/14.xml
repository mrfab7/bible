  <verse number="1">“Let not your hearts be troubled. Trust in God: trust in me also.</verse>
  <verse number="2">In my Father’s house there are many resting-places. Were it otherwise, I would have told you; for I am going to make ready a place for you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And if I go and make ready a place for you, I will return and take you to be with me, that where I am you also may be.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And where I am going, you all know the way.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">“Master,” said Thomas, “we do not know where you are going. In what sense do we know the way?”</verse>
  <verse number="6">“I am the Way,” replied Jesus, “and the Truth and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">If you—all of you—knew me, you would fully know my Father also. From this time forward you know Him and have seen Him.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">“Master,” said Philip, “cause us to see the Father: that is all we need.”</verse>
  <verse number="9">“Have I been so long among you,” Jesus answered, “and yet you, Philip, do not know me? He who has seen me has seen the Father. How can *you* ask me, ‘Cause us to see the Father’?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Do you not believe that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me? The things that I tell you all I do not speak on my own authority: but the Father dwelling within me carries on His own work.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Believe me, all of you, that I am in the Father and that the Father is in me; or at any rate, believe me because of what I do.</verse>
  <verse number="12">In most solemn truth I tell you that he who trusts in me—the things which I do he shall do also; and greater things than these he shall do, because I am going to the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And whatever any of you ask in my name, I will do, in order that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</verse>
  <verse number="14">If you make any request of me in my name, I will do it.</verse>
  <verse number="15">“If you love me, you will obey my commandments.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Advocate to be for ever with you—the Spirit of truth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">That Spirit the world cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him. You know Him, because He remains by your side and is in you.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I will not leave you bereaved: I am coming to you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Yet a little while and the world will see me no more, but you will see me: because I live, you also shall live.</verse>
  <verse number="20">At that time you will know that I am in my Father, and that you are in me, and that I am in you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He who has my commandments and obeys them—he it is who loves me. And he who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and will clearly reveal myself to him.”</verse>
  <verse number="22">Judas (not the Iscariot)</verse>
  <verse number="23">“If any one loves me,” replied Jesus, “he will obey my teaching; and my Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He who has no love for me does not obey my teaching; and yet the teaching to which you are listening is not mine, but is the teaching of the Father who sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="25">“All this I have spoken to you while still with you.</verse>
  <verse number="26">But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send at my request, will teach you everything, and will bring to your memories all that I have said to you.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Peace I leave with you: my own peace I give to you. It is not as the world gives its greetings that I give you peace. Let not your hearts be troubled or dismayed.</verse>
  <verse number="28">“You heard me say to you, ‘I am going away, and yet I am coming to you.’ If you loved me, you would have rejoiced because I am going to the Father; for the Father is greater than I am.</verse>
  <verse number="29">I have now told you before it comes to pass, that when it has come to pass you may believe.</verse>
  <verse number="30">In future I shall not talk much with you, for the Prince of this world is coming. And yet in me he has nothing;</verse>
  <verse number="31">but it is in order that the world may know that I love the Father, and that it is in obedience to the command which the Father gave me that I thus act. Rise, let us be going.”</verse>
