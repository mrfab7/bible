  <verse number="1">Accordingly He went on board, and crossing over came to His own town.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Here they brought to Him a paralytic lying on a bed. Seeing their faith Jesus said to the paralytic, “Take courage, my child; your sins are pardoned.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">“Such language is impious,” said some of the Scribes among themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Knowing their thoughts Jesus said, “Why are you cherishing evil thoughts in your hearts?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Why, which is easier?—to say, ‘Your sins are pardoned,’ or to say ‘Rise up and walk’?</verse>
  <verse number="6">But, to prove to you that the Son of Man has authority on earth to pardon sins”—He then says to the paralytic, “Rise, and take up your bed and go home.”</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he got up, and went off home.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the crowds were awe-struck when they saw it, and ascribed the glory to God who had entrusted such power to a man.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Passing on thence Jesus saw a man called Matthew sitting at the Toll Office, and said to him, “Follow me.” And he arose, and followed Him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And while He was reclining at table, a large number of tax-gathers and notorious sinners were of the party with Jesus and His disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The Pharisees noticed this, and they inquired of His disciples, “Why does your Teacher eat with the tax-gatherers and notorious sinners?”</verse>
  <verse number="12">He heard the question and replied, “It is not men in good health who require a doctor, but the sick.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But go and learn what this means, ‘It is mercy that I desire, not sacrifice’; for I did not come to appeal to the righteous, but to sinners.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">At that time John’s disciples came and asked Jesus, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not?”</verse>
  <verse number="15">“Can the bridegroom’s party mourn,” He replied, “as long as the bridegroom is with them? But other days will come (when the Bridegroom has been taken from them)</verse>
  <verse number="16">No one ever mends an old cloak with a patch of newly woven cloth. Otherwise, the patch put on would tear away some of the old, and a worse hole would be made.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Nor do people pour new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the skins would split, the wine would escape, and the skins be destroyed. But they put new wine into fresh skins, and both are saved.”</verse>
  <verse number="18">While He was thus speaking, a Ruler came up and profoundly bowing said, “My daughter is just dead; but come and put your hand upon her and she will return to life.”</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Jesus rose and followed him, as did also His disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But a woman who for twelve years had been afflicted with haemorrhage came behind Him and touched the tassel of His cloak;</verse>
  <verse number="21">for she said to herself, “If I but touch His cloak, I shall be cured.”</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Jesus turned and saw her, and said, “Take courage, daughter; your faith has cured you.” And the woman was restored to health from that moment.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Entering the Ruler’s house, Jesus saw the flute-players and the crowd loudly wailing,</verse>
  <verse number="24">and He said, “Go out of the room; the little girl is not dead, but asleep.” And they laughed at Him.</verse>
  <verse number="25">When however the place was cleared of the crowd, Jesus went in, and on His taking the little girl by the hand, she rose up.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the report of this spread throughout all that district.</verse>
  <verse number="27">As Jesus passed on, two blind men followed Him, shouting and saying, “Pity us, Son of David.”</verse>
  <verse number="28">And when He had gone indoors, they came to Him. “Do you believe that I can do this?” He asked them. “Yes, Sir,” they replied.</verse>
  <verse number="29">So He touched their eyes and said, “According to your faith let it be to you.”</verse>
  <verse number="30">Then their eyes were opened. And assuming a stern tone Jesus said to them, “Be careful to let no one know.”</verse>
  <verse number="31">But they went out and published His fame in all that district.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And as they were leaving His presence a dumb demoniac was brought to Him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">When the demon was expelled, the dumb man could speak. And the crowds exclaimed in astonishment, “Never was such a thing seen in Israel.”</verse>
  <verse number="34">But the Pharisees maintained, “It is by the power of the Prince of the demons that he drives out the demons.”</verse>
  <verse number="35">And Jesus continued His circuits through all the towns and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom, and curing every kind of disease and infirmity.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And when He saw the crowds He was touched with pity for them, because they were distressed and were fainting on the ground like sheep which have no shepherd.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Then He said to His disciples, “The harvest is abundant, but the reapers are few;</verse>
  <verse number="38">therefore entreat the Owner of the Harvest to send out reapers into His fields.”</verse>
