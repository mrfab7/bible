<chapter book="Philemon" number="1" translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" translationID="jps" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother: To Philemon our dearly-loved fellow labourer—</verse>
  <verse number="2">and to our sister Apphia and our comrade Archippus—as well as to the Church in your house.</verse>
  <verse number="3">May grace be granted to you all, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I give continual thanks to my God while making mention of you, my brother, in my prayers,</verse>
  <verse number="5">because I hear of your love and of the faith which you have towards the Lord Jesus and which you manifest towards all God’s people;</verse>
  <verse number="6">praying as I do, that their participation in your faith may result in others fully recognizing all the right affection that is in us toward Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For I have found great joy and comfort in your love, because the hearts of God’s people have been, and are, refreshed through you, my brother.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Therefore, though I might with Christ’s authority speak very freely and order you to do what is fitting,</verse>
  <verse number="9">it is for love’s sake that—instead of that—although I am none other than Paul the aged, and am now also a prisoner for Christ Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="10">I entreat you on behalf of my own child whose father I have become while in my chains—I mean Onesimus.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Formerly he was useless to you, but now—true to his name—he is of great use to you and to me.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I am sending him back to you, though in so doing I send part of myself.</verse>
  <verse number="13">It was my wish to keep him at my side for him to attend to my wants, as your representative, during my imprisonment for the Good News.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Only I wished to do nothing without your consent, so that his kind action of yours might not be done under pressure, but might be a voluntary one.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For perhaps it was for this reason he was parted from you for a time, that you might receive him back wholly and for ever yours;</verse>
  <verse number="16">no longer as a slave, but as something better than a slave—a brother peculiarly dear to me, and even dearer to you, both as a servant and as a fellow Christian.</verse>
  <verse number="17">If therefore you regard me as a comrade, receive him as if he were I myself.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And if he was ever dishonest or is in your debt, debit me with the amount.</verse>
  <verse number="19">I Paul write this with my own hand—I will pay you in full. (I say nothing of the fact that you owe me even your own self.)</verse>
  <verse number="20">Yes, brother, do me this favour for the Lord’s sake. Refresh my heart in Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="21">I write to you in the full confidence that you will meet my wishes, for I know you will do even more than I say.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And at the same time provide accommodation for me; for I hope that through your prayers I shall be permitted to come to you.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Greetings to you, my brother, from Epaphras my fellow prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus;</verse>
  <verse number="24">and from Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.</verse>
  <verse number="25">May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with the spirit of every one of you.</verse>
