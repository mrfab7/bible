<p class="verse" data-verse="1">These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah transcribed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; but the glory of kings is to search out a thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The heavens for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Take away the dross from the silver, and there cometh forth a vessel for the refiner:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Put not thyself forward in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of the great;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">for better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither, than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Go not forth hastily to strive, lest [thou know not] what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Debate thy cause with thy neighbour, but reveal not the secret of another;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">lest he that heareth [it] disgrace thee, and thine evil report turn not away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">[As] apples of gold in pictures of silver, is a word spoken in season.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">An ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, is a wise reprover upon an attentive ear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, [so] is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Clouds and wind without rain, [so] is a man that boasteth himself of a false gift.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">By long forbearing is a ruler persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Hast thou found honey? Eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be surfeited therewith, and vomit it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Let thy foot be seldom in thy neighbourâ€™s house; lest he be weary of thee and hate thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">A maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow, is a man that beareth false witness against his neighbour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A broken tooth, and a tottering foot, is confidence in an unfaithful [man] in the day of trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">[As] he that taketh off a garment in cold weather, [and as] vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to a sad heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">for thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and Jehovah shall reward thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The north wind bringeth forth rain, and the angry countenance a backbiting tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a contentious woman, and a house in common.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">[As] cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">A troubled fountain, and a defiled well, is a righteous [man] that giveth way before the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">It is not good to eat much honey; and to search into weighty matters is [itself] a weight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He that hath no rule over his own spirit is [as] a city broken down, without walls.</p>
