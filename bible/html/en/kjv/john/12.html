<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s [son], which should betray him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed [is] the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and [that] they had done these things unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will [my] Father honour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, [saying], I have both glorified [it], and will glorify [it] again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">The people therefore, that stood by, and heard [it], said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all [men] unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">This he said, signifying what death he should die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with [their] eyes, nor understand with [their] heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess [him], lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</p>
