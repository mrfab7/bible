  <verse number="1">And the festival of unleavened drew near, called the Pascha.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Satan came into Judas called Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And having departed, he conversed with the chief priests and the generals, how he might deliver him to them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And they rejoiced, and agreed to give him silver.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he promised, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them apart from the crowd.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the day of unleavened came, in which must be sacrificed the pascha.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he sent Peter and John, saying, Having gone, prepare ye for us the pascha, that we might eat.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they said to him, Where wilt thou that we should prepare?</verse>
  <verse number="10">And he said to them, Behold, you having come to the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing an earthen vessel of water; follow ye him to the house where he goes in.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And ye shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher says to thee, Where is the room where I should eat the pascha with my disciples?</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he shall shew you a great upper room spread: there prepare ye.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And having departed, they found as he said to them; and they prepared the pascha.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And when it was the hour, he reclined, and the twelve sent with him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he said to them, With eager desire have I desired to eat this pascha with you before I suffer:</verse>
  <verse number="16">For I say to you, no more should I eat of it, till when it should be completed in the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Having taken the cup, and returned thanks, he said, Take this, and divide among yourselves:</verse>
  <verse number="18">For I say to you, that I drink not of the fruit of the vine, till when the kingdom of God comes.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Having taken the bread, and returned thanks, he brake, and gave them, saying, This is my body given for you: this do ye for my remembrance.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Likewise also the cup after supping, saying, This the cup, the new covenant in my blood, poured out for you:</verse>
  <verse number="21">But, behold, the hand of him delivering me up with me at the table.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And truly the Son of man goes according to that determined: but woe to that man by whom he is delivered up!</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they began to seek together among themselves, which of them it should be that was about to do this thing.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And a love of strife was in them, which of them thinks to be the greater.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he said to them, The kings of the nations rule over them; and they exercising power over them are called benefactors.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And ye not so: but let the greater with you be as the younger; and he leading, as he serving.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For which the greater, he reclining, or he serving? is not he reclining and I am in the midst of you as he serving.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And ye are they having remained with me in my temptations.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And I set to you, as my Father set to me, a kingdom;</verse>
  <verse number="30">That ye might eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and might sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has demanded you, to sift as wheat:</verse>
  <verse number="32">And I have supplicated for thee that thy faith fail not: and thou, when having turned back, confirm thy brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And he said to him, Lord, with thee am I ready to go, and to prison, and to death.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And he said, I say to thee, Peter, the cock shall not utter a sound this day, before thou shalt thrice deny knowing me.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did ye want any thing? And they said, Nothing,</verse>
  <verse number="36">Then said he to them, But now, he having a purse, let him take up, and likewise a wallet: and he not having, let him sell his garment, and buy a sword.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For I say to you, that this written must yet be finished in me, that, Also was he reckoned with the lawless: for also the things concerning me have an end.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And they said, Lord, behold, two swords here. And he said to them, It is enough.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And having come out, he went, according to custom, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples followed him.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And being at the place, he said to them, Pray ye not to enter into temptation.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And he was removed from them about a stone’s cast, and having placed the knees, he prayed,</verse>
  <verse number="42">Saying, Father, If thou art willing, turn aside this cup from me: but not my will, but thine, be done.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And a messenger was seen to him from heaven, strengthening him.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And being in a violent struggle, he prayed more intently: and his sweat was as clots of blood coming down upon the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And having risen from prayer, having come to his disciples, he found them sleeping from grief;</verse>
  <verse number="46">And he said to them, Why sleep ye? having risen, pray that ye might not enter into temptation.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And he yet speaking, Behold a crowd, and he called Judas, one of the twelve, came before them, and drew near to Jesus to kiss him.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And Jesus said to him, Judas, deliverest thou up the Son of man with a kiss?</verse>
  <verse number="49">And they about him, having seen that, going to be, said to him, Lord, shall we strike with the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="50">And a certain one of them struck a servant of the chief priest, and took away his right ear.</verse>
  <verse number="51">And Jesus having answered said, Allow ye even to this. And having touched his ear, he healed him.</verse>
  <verse number="52">And Jesus said to the chief priests, and generals of the temple, and the elders, having come to him, Have ye come out, as upon a robber, with sword and sticks?</verse>
  <verse number="53">I being with you daily in the temple, ye stretched not forth the hands upon me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="54">And having taken, they brought him into the house of the chief priest. And Peter followed him far off.</verse>
  <verse number="55">And having kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and they having sat down together, Peter sat down in the midst of them.</verse>
  <verse number="56">And a certain young girl having seen him sitting by the light, and looked intently upon him, said, And this was with him.</verse>
  <verse number="57">And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</verse>
  <verse number="58">And after a little another having seen him, said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.</verse>
  <verse number="59">And about the space of one hour a certain other assured himself, saying, of a truth this also was with him: for he is a Galilean.</verse>
  <verse number="60">And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, he yet speaking, the cock uttered a sound.</verse>
  <verse number="61">And the Lord having turned, looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him, That before the cock utters a sound, thou shalt deny me thrice.</verse>
  <verse number="62">And Peter having come forth without wept bitterly.</verse>
  <verse number="63">And the men holding Jesus mocked him, stripping.</verse>
  <verse number="64">And having covered him, they struck his face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy who it is having struck thee.</verse>
  <verse number="65">And many other things, blaspheming, they spake against him.</verse>
  <verse number="66">And when it was day, the council of elders of the people was gathered together, and the chief priests and scribes, and they brought him to their council,</verse>
  <verse number="67">Saying, Art thou Christ? tell us. And he said to them, If I tell you, ye would not believe:</verse>
  <verse number="68">And if I ask you, ye would not answer me, or loose me.</verse>
  <verse number="69">From now shall the Son of man be sitting from the right hand of the power of God.</verse>
  <verse number="70">And they all said, Art thou therefore the Son of God? And he said to them, Ye say that I am.</verse>
  <verse number="71">And they said, Why have we yet need of testimony? for we ourselves have heard from his month.</verse>
