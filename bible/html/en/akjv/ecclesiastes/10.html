<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking smell: so does a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A wise man’s heart is at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Yes also, when he that is a fool walks by the way, his wisdom fails him, and he said to every one that he is a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If the spirit of the ruler rise up against you, leave not your place; for yielding pacifies great offenses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceeds from the ruler:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking as servants on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that digs a pit shall fall into it; and whoever breaks an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Whoever removes stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that splits wood shall be endangered thereby.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The labor of the foolish wearies every one of them, because he knows not how to go to the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Woe to you, O land, when your king is a child, and your princes eat in the morning!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Blessed are you, O land, when your king is the son of nobles, and your princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">By much slothfulness the building decays; and through idleness of the hands the house drops through.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes merry: but money answers all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Curse not the king, no not in your thought; and curse not the rich in your bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which has wings shall tell the matter.</p>
