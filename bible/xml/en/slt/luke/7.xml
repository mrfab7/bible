  <verse number="1">And when he completed all his words in the ears of the people, he came to Capernaum.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And a certain centurion’s servant being sick, was about to die; which was highly valued by him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And having heard of Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to him, asking him, that having come, he would save his servant.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they approaching to Jesus, besought him earnestly, saying, That he is worthy to whom he will bestow this:</verse>
  <verse number="5">For he loves our nation, and has built us a synagogue.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Jesus went with them. And now he being away not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not fit that thou shouldest come under my roof;</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore neither thought I myself worthy to come to thee: but speak in a word, and my servant shall be healed.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For I also am a man set under authority, having soldiers under myself, and I say to this, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes: and to my servant, Do this, and he does.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Jesus having heard these, wondered at him, and having turned to the crowd following him, he said, I say to you, Neither have I found so much faith in Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And those sent, having turned back to the house, found the servant being sick, restored to health.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it was in continuation he went to a city called Nain; and sufficient of his disciples went with him, and a great crowd.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And as he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, he dead was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she a widow; and a sufficient crowd of the city was with her.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And having seen her, the Lord felt compassion for her and said to her, Weep not.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And having come, he touched the coffin, and they bearing stood. And he said, Young man, I say to thee, arise.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the dead sat up, and began to speak. And he gave him to his mother.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And fear took all; and they praised God, saying, That a great prophet has risen up among us; and That God has reviewed his people.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And this word went out about him in all Judea, and in all the country round about.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And John’s disciples announced to him of all these things.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And having called certain two of his disciples, John sent to Jesus, saying, Art thou he coming? or should we expect another?</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the men, having approached to him, said, John the Immerser has sent us to thee, saying, Art thou he coming? or should we expect another?</verse>
  <verse number="21">And in that same hour he cured many of diseases, and scourges, and evil spirits, and to many blind he conferred the favor to see.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Jesus having answered said to them, Having gone, announce to John what ye saw and heard; for the blind look up, the lame walk, the leprous are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor are announced good news.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And happy is he, whoever should not be offended in me.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the messengers of John having departed, he began to say to the crowds concerning John, What went ye forth into the desert to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</verse>
  <verse number="25">But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Behold, those in glorious clothing, and being in luxury, are in royal abodes.</verse>
  <verse number="26">But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say to you, superior to a prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="27">This is he of whom it has been written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.</verse>
  <verse number="28">For I say to you, Among the begotten of women none is a greater prophet than John the Immerser; and the less in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And all the people having heard, and the publicans, justified God, having been immersed with the immersion of John.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And the Pharisees, and they pertaining to the law, rejected the counsel of God against themselves, not immersed by him.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the Lord said, To whom shall I liken the men of this generation? and to whom are they like?</verse>
  <verse number="32">They are like children sitting in the market-place, and calling to one another, and saying, We played the flute to you, and ye danced not; we lamented to you, and ye wept not.</verse>
  <verse number="33">For John the Immerser came, neither eating bread, nor drinking wine, and ye say, He has a demon.</verse>
  <verse number="34">The Son of man came eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a man, a glutton, and wine-drinker, a friend of publicans and sinful.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And wisdom was justified of all her children.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And a certain one of the Pharisees asked him that he would eat with him. And having come into the Pharisee’s house, he reclined.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And, behold, a woman in the city, who was sinful, knowing that he is reclining at table in the Pharisee’s house, having brought an alabaster box of perfumed oil,</verse>
  <verse number="38">And stood at his feet behind, weeping, been to wet his feet with tears, and wiped with the hairs of her head; and she kissed his feet, and anointed with the perfumed oil.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And the Pharisee having called him, seeing, said within himself, This, if he were a prophet, had known who and what race of woman which had touched him: for she is sinful.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And Jesus having answered, said to him, Simon, I have something to say to thee. And he says, Teacher, speak.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Two debtors were to a certain money-lender: one owed five hundred drachmas, and the other fifty.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And they not having to pay, he bestowed as a gift upon both. Which of them therefore will love him the more? Say thou.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And Simon, having answered, said, I suppose, that to whom he bestowed more favor. And he said to him, Thou hast judged rightly,</verse>
  <verse number="44">And having turned to the woman, he said to Simon, Thou seest this woman? I came into thy house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: and she wet my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Thou gavest me no kiss: and she from when I came in left not kissing my feet.</verse>
  <verse number="46">Thou anointedst not my head with oil: and she anointed my feet with perfumed oil.</verse>
  <verse number="47">For which I say to thee, Her many sins are remitted; for she loved much: and he to whom little is remitted, loves little.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And he said to her, Thy sins are remitted.</verse>
  <verse number="49">And they reclining together began to say in themselves, Who is this who also remits sins?</verse>
  <verse number="50">And he said to the woman, Thy faith has saved thee; go in peace.</verse>
