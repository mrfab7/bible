<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="43" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But now thus saith Jehovah that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed thee; I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I am Jehovah thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour; I have given Egypt as thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in thy stead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Since thou hast been precious in my sight, and honorable, and I have loved thee; therefore will I give men in thy stead, and peoples instead of thy life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Fear not; for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back; bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the end of the earth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">every one that is called by my name, and whom I have created for my glory, whom I have formed, yea, whom I have made.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the peoples be assembled: who among them can declare this, and show us former things? let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified; or let them hear, and say, It is truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen; that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I, even I, am Jehovah; and besides me there is no saviour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I have declared, and I have saved, and I have showed; and there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and I am God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Yea, since the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who can hinder it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thus saith Jehovah, your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and I will bring down all of them as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships of their rejoicing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I am Jehovah, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Thus saith Jehovah, who maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">who bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the mighty man (they lie down together, they shall not rise; they are extinct, they are quenched as a wick):</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Behold, I will do a new thing; now shall it spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The beasts of the field shall honor me, the jackals and the ostriches; because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">the people which I formed for myself, that they might set forth my praise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Yet thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Thou hast not brought me of thy sheep for burnt-offerings; neither hast thou honored me with thy sacrifices. I have not burdened thee with offerings, nor wearied thee with frankincense.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices; but thou hast burdened me with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake; and I will not remember thy sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Put me in remembrance; let us plead together: set thou forth thy cause, that thou mayest be justified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Thy first father sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary; and I will make Jacob a curse, and Israel a reviling.</p>
