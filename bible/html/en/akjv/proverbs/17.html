<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="17" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causes shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD tries the hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A wicked doer gives heed to false lips; and a liar gives ear to a naughty tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Childrenâ€™s children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Excellent speech becomes not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that has it: wherever it turns, it prospers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He that covers a transgression seeks love; but he that repeats a matter separates very friends.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A reproof enters more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">An evil man seeks only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whoever rewards evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The beginning of strife is as when one lets out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He that justifies the wicked, and he that comdemns the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Why is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he has no heart to it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">A man void of understanding strikes hands, and becomes surety in the presence of his friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He loves transgression that loves strife: and he that exalts his gate seeks destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He that has a fraudulent heart finds no good: and he that has a perverse tongue falls into mischief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He that begets a fool does it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool has no joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A merry heart does good like a medicine: but a broken spirit dries the bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">A wicked man takes a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Wisdom is before him that has understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bore him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He that has knowledge spares his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Even a fool, when he holds his peace, is counted wise: and he that shuts his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.</p>
