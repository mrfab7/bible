<chapter book="Isaiah" number="20" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">In the year of the coming in of Tartan to Ashdod, when Sargon king of Asshur sendeth him, and he fighteth against Ashdod, and captureth it,</verse>
  <verse number="2">at that time spake Jehovah by the hand of Isaiah son of Amoz, saying, ‘Go, and thou hast loosed the sackcloth from off thy loins, and thy sandal thou dost draw from off thy foot,’ and he doth so, going naked and barefoot.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Jehovah saith, ‘As My servant Isaiah hath gone naked and barefoot three years, a sign and a wonder for Egypt and for Cush,</verse>
  <verse number="4">so doth the king of Asshur lead the captivity of Egypt, and the removal of Cush, young and old, naked and barefoot, with seat uncovered—the nakedness of Egypt;</verse>
  <verse number="5">and they have been affrighted and ashamed of Cush their confidence, and of Egypt their beauty,</verse>
  <verse number="6">and the inhabitant of this isle hath said in that day—Lo, thus is our trust, Whither we have fled for help, To be delivered from the king of Asshur, And how do we escape—we?’</verse>
