<p class="verse" data-verse="1">How beautiful are your feet with shoes, O prince’s daughter! the joints of your thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Your navel is like a round goblet, which wants not liquor: your belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Your two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Your neck is as a tower of ivory; your eyes like the fish pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: your nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Your head on you is like Carmel, and the hair of your head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">How fair and how pleasant are you, O love, for delights!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">This your stature is like to a palm tree, and your breasts to clusters of grapes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also your breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of your nose like apples;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the roof of your mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goes down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I am my beloved’s, and his desire is toward me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give you my loves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved.</p>
