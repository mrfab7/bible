  <verse number="1">Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel came!</verse>
  <verse number="2">Pass you to Calneh, and see; and from there go you to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?</verse>
  <verse number="3">You that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;</verse>
  <verse number="4">That lie on beds of ivory, and stretch themselves on their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the middle of the stall;</verse>
  <verse number="5">That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of music, like David;</verse>
  <verse number="6">That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The Lord GOD has sworn by himself, said the LORD the God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And a man’s uncle shall take him up, and he that burns him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say to him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with you? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold your tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For, behold, the LORD commands, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Shall horses run on the rock? will one plow there with oxen? for you have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock:</verse>
  <verse number="13">You which rejoice in a thing of nothing, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?</verse>
  <verse number="14">But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, said the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hemath to the river of the wilderness.</verse>
