<chapter book="Proverbs" number="25" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">These are also parables of Solomon, which the men of Ezechias king of Juda copied out.</verse>
  <verse number="2">It is the glory of God to conceal the word, and the glory of kings to search out the speech.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The heaven above, and the earth beneath, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Take away the rust from silver, and there shall come forth a most pure vessel:</verse>
  <verse number="5">Take away wickedness from the face of the king, and his throne shall be established with justice.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Appear not glorious before the king, and stand not in the place of great men.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For it is better that it should be said to thee: Come up hither; than that thou shouldst be humbled before the prince.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The things which thy eyes have seen, utter not hastily in a quarrel: lest after- ward thou mayst not be able to make amends, when thou hast dishonoured thy friend.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Treat thy cause with thy friend, and discover not the secret to a stranger:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Lest he insult over thee, when he hath heard it, and cease not to upbraid thee. Grace and friendship deliver a man: keep these for thyself, lest thou fall under reproach.</verse>
  <verse number="11">To speak a word in due time, is like apples of gold on beds of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="12">As an earring of gold and a bright pearl, so is he that reproveth the wise, and the obedient ear.</verse>
  <verse number="13">As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to him that sent him, for he refresheth his soul.</verse>
  <verse number="14">As clouds, and wind, when no rain followeth, so is the man that boasteth, and doth not fulfil his promises.</verse>
  <verse number="15">By patience a prince shall be appeased, and a soft tongue shall break hardness.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Thou hast found honey, eat what is sufficient for thee, lest being glutted therewith thou vomit it up.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Withdraw thy foot from the house of thy neighbour, lest having his fill he hate thee.</verse>
  <verse number="18">A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour, is like a dart and a sword and a sharp arrow.</verse>
  <verse number="19">To trust to an unfaithful man in the time of trouble, is like a rotten tooth, and weary foot,</verse>
  <verse number="20">And one that looseth his garment in cold weather. As vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to a very evil heart. As a moth doth by a garment, and a worm by the wood: so the sadness of a man consumeth the heart.</verse>
  <verse number="21">If thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat: if he thirst, give him water to drink:</verse>
  <verse number="22">For thou shalt heap hot coals upon his head, and the Lord will reward thee.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The north wind driveth away rain, as doth a sad countenance a backbiting tongue.</verse>
  <verse number="24">It is better to sit m a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman, and in a common house.</verse>
  <verse number="25">As cold water to a thirsty soul, so is good tidings from a far country.</verse>
  <verse number="26">A just man falling down before the wicked, is as a fountain troubled with the foot, and a corrupted spring.</verse>
  <verse number="27">As it is not good for a man to eat much honey, so he that is a searcher of majesty, shall be overwhelmed by glory.</verse>
  <verse number="28">As a city that lieth open and is not compassed with walls, so is a man that cannot refrain his own spirit in speaking.</verse>
