<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And these the commands and the laws and the judgments that Jehovah you God commanded to teach you to do in the land which ye are passing over there to possess it:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">So that thou shalt fear Jehovah thy God, to watch all his laws and his commands which I am commanding thee, thou and thy son and thy sonâ€™s son all the days of thy life; and so that thy days shall be prolonged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And hear, O Israel, and watch to do, that it shall be well to thee, and that ye shall multiply greatly as Jehovah the God of your fathers spake to thee, a land flowing with milk and honey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Hear, Israel; Jehovah our God is one Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And love thou Jehovah thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And these words which I command thee to do shall be upon thy heart;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And sharpen them to thy sons, and speak in them in thy resting in thy house, and in thy going in the way, and in thy lying down and in thy rising up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for bands between thine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And it was when Jehovah thy God shall bring thee in to the land which he sware to thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaak and to Jacob, to give to thee cities great and good which thou didst not build,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And houses full of all good which thou filledst not, and wells hewed out which thou hewedst not, and vineyards and olives which thou didst not plant; and thou atest and wert satisfied:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Watch to thyself lest thou shalt forget Jehovah who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Jehovah thy God shalt thou fear, and him shalt thou serve, and in his name shalt thou swear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Ye shall not go after other gods from the gods of the peoples which are round about you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">(For Jehovah thy God a jealous God in the midst of thee) lest the anger of Jehovah thy God shall kindle against thee and destroy thee from the face of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Ye shall not try Jehovah your God, as ye tempted in Massah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Watching, ye shall watch the commands of Jehovah your God, and his testimonies, and his laws that he commanded thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And do thou the right and the good in the eyes of Jehovah so that it shall be well to thee, and thou go in and possess the good land which Jehovah sware to thy fathers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">To drive out all thine enemies from before thee as Jehovah spake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">When thy son shall ask thee tomorrow, saying, What the testimonies and the laws and the judgments which Jehovah our God commanded you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And say thou to thy son, We were servants to Pharaoh in Egypt, and Jehovah brought us out of Egypt by a strong hand:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Jehovah will give signs and wonders, great and evil, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh and upon all his house before our eyes:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he brought us out from there in order to bring us in to give to us the land which he sware to our fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Jehovah will command us to do all these laws, to fear Jehovah our God, for good to us all the days, to preserve us alive as this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And it shall be justice to us when we shall watch to do all these commands before Jehovah our God as he commanded us.</p>
