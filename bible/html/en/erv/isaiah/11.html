<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And his delight shall be in the fear of the LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">but with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And it shall come to pass in that day, that the root of Jesse, which standeth for an ensign of the peoples, unto him shall the nations seek; and his resting place shall be glorious.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his people, which shall remain, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar, and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.</p>
