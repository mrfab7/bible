<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Therefore, holy brothers, who share in the heavenly calling, set your focus on Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">He was faithful to the One who appointed Him, just as Moses was faithful in all God’s house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For Jesus has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Now Moses was faithful as a servant in all God’s house, testifying to what would be spoken later.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But Christ is faithful as the Son over God’s house. And we are His house, if we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope of which we boast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: “Today, if you hear His voice,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">do not harden your hearts, as you did in the rebellion, in the day of testing in the wilderness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">where your fathers tested and tried Me, and for forty years saw My works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore I was angry with that generation, and I said, ‘Their hearts are always going astray, and they have not known My ways.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">So I swore on oath in My anger, ‘They shall never enter My rest.’”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">See to it, brothers, that none of you has a wicked heart of unbelief that turns away from the living God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But exhort one another daily, as long as it is called today, so that none of you may be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly to the end the assurance we had at first.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">As it has been said: “Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts, as you did in the rebellion.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For who were the ones who heard and rebelled? Were they not all those Moses led out of Egypt?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And with whom was God angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And to whom did He swear that they would never enter His rest? Was it not to those who disobeyed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">So we see that it was because of their unbelief that they were unable to enter.</p>
