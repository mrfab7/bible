  <verse number="1">Ephraim striveth after wind, and followeth after the east wind; All the day he multiplieth lies and desolation; And they make a covenant with Assyria, And oil is carried into Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="2">The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, And will punish Jacob according to his ways, According to his doings will He recompense him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">In the womb he took his brother by the heel, And by his strength he strove with a godlike being;</verse>
  <verse number="4">So he strove with an angel, and prevailed; He wept, and made supplication unto him; At Beth-el he would find him, And there he would speak with us;</verse>
  <verse number="5">But the LORD, the God of hosts, The LORD is His name.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Therefore turn thou to thy God; Keep mercy and justice, And wait for thy God continually.</verse>
  <verse number="7">As for the trafficker, the balances of deceit are in his hand. He loveth to oppress.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Ephraim said: ‘Surely I am become rich, I have found me wealth; In all my labours they shall find in me No iniquity that were sin.’</verse>
  <verse number="9">But I am the LORD thy God From the land of Egypt; I will yet again make thee to dwell in tents, As in the days of the appointed season.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I have also spoken unto the prophets, And I have multiplied visions; And by the ministry of the prophets have I used similitudes.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If Gilead be given to iniquity Becoming altogether vanity, In Gilgal they sacrifice unto bullocks; Yea, their altars shall be as heaps In the furrows of the field.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Jacob fled into the field of Aram, And Israel served for a wife, And for a wife he kept sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel up out of Egypt, And by a prophet was he kept.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Ephraim hath provoked most bitterly; Therefore shall his blood be cast upon him, And his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.</verse>
