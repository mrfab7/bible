<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Behold, you are fair, my love; behold, you are fair; you have doves’ eyes within your locks: your hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Your teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Your lips are like a thread of scarlet, and your speech is comely: your temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within your locks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Your neck is like the tower of David built for an armory, where on there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Your two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">You are all fair, my love; there is no spot in you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions’ dens, from the mountains of the leopards.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">You have ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; you have ravished my heart with one of your eyes, with one chain of your neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">How fair is your love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is your love than wine! and the smell of your ointments than all spices!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Your lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under your tongue; and the smell of your garments is like the smell of Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A garden enclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Awake, O north wind; and come, you south; blow on my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.</p>
