  <verse number="1">I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.</verse>
  <verse number="2">[As to] every branch in me not bearing fruit, he takes it away; and [as to] every one bearing fruit, he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Ye are already clean by reason of the word which I have spoken to you.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Abide in me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abide in the vine, thus neither [can] ye unless ye abide in me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I am the vine, ye [are] the branches. He that abides in me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Unless any one abide in me he is cast out as the branch, and is dried up; and they gather them and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</verse>
  <verse number="7">If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will and it shall come to pass to you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">In this is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit, and ye shall become disciples of mine.</verse>
  <verse number="9">As the Father has loved me, I also have loved you: abide in my love.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love, as I have kept my Father’s commandments and abide in his love.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I have spoken these things to you that my joy may be in you, and your joy be full.</verse>
  <verse number="12">This is my commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you.</verse>
  <verse number="13">No one has greater love than this, that one should lay down his life for his friends.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Ye are my friends if ye practise whatever I command you.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I call you no longer bondmen, for the bondman does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things which I have heard of my Father I have made known to you.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and have set you that ye should go and [that] ye should bear fruit, and [that] your fruit should abide, that whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name he may give you.</verse>
  <verse number="17">These things I command you, that ye love one another.</verse>
  <verse number="18">If the world hate you, know that it has hated me before you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">If ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, on account of this the world hates you.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Remember the word which I said unto you, The bondman is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my word, they will keep also yours.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But they will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they have not known him that sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He that hates me hates also my Father.</verse>
  <verse number="24">If I had not done among them the works which no other one has done, they had not had sin; but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But that the word written in their law might be fulfilled, They hated me without a cause.</verse>
  <verse number="26">But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes forth from with the Father, he shall bear witness concerning me;</verse>
  <verse number="27">and ye too bear witness, because ye are with me from [the] beginning.</verse>
