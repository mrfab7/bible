<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="5" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even among the Gentiles, that one of you hath his father’s wife.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And ye are puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he that had done this deed might be taken away from among you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For I verily, being absent in body but present in spirit, have already, as though I were present, judged him that hath so wrought this thing,</verse>
  <verse number="4">in the name of our Lord Jesus, ye being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="5">to deliver such a one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, even as ye are unleavened. For our passover also hath been sacrificed, even Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="8">wherefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I wrote unto you in my epistle to have no company with fornicators;</verse>
  <verse number="10">not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world:</verse>
  <verse number="11">but now I write unto you not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a one no, not to eat.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For what have I to do with judging them that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within,</verse>
  <verse number="13">whereas them that are without God judgeth? Put away the wicked man from among yourselves.</verse>
