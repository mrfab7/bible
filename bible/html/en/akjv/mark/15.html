<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? And he answering said to them, You say it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answer you nothing? behold how many things they witness against you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marveled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Now at that feast he released to them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But Pilate answered them, saying, Will you that I release to you the King of the Jews?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Pilate answered and said again to them, What will you then that I shall do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And they cried out again, Crucify him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas to them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit on him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots on them, what every man should take.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And the scripture was fulfilled, which said, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, you that destroy the temple, and build it in three days,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Save yourself, and come down from the cross.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calls Elias.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him;) and many other women which came up with him to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">Joseph of Arimathaea, an honorable counselor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly to Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And Pilate marveled if he were already dead: and calling to him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulcher which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulcher.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.</p>
