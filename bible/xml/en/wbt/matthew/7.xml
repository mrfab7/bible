  <verse number="1">Judge not, that ye be not judged.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and the measure which ye give, shall be measured to you again.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thy own eye?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thy eye; and behold, a beam is in thy own eye?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thy own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Give not that which is holy to dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and the door shall be opened to you:</verse>
  <verse number="8">For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, the door shall be opened.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Or what man is there of you, who, if his son shall ask bread, will give him a stone?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Or if he shall ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?</verse>
  <verse number="11">If ye then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Therefore all things whatever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there are who go in by it.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth to life, and few there are that find it.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Ye shall know them by their fruits: Do men gather grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles:</verse>
  <verse number="17">Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="18">A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them,</verse>
  <verse number="21">Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out demons? and in thy name done many wonderful works?</verse>
  <verse number="23">And then will I profess to them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore whoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house upon a rock:</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand:</verse>
  <verse number="27">And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.</verse>
