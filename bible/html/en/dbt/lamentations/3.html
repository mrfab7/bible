<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I am the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Me hath he led, and brought into darkness, and not into light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Surely against me hath he turned again and again his hand all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">My flesh and my skin hath he wasted away, he hath broken my bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He hath built against me, and encompassed [me] with gall and toil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He hath made me to dwell in dark places as those that have been long dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He hath hedged me about that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Even when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He is unto me [as] a bear lying in wait, a lion in secret places.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he hath made me desolate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I am become a derision to all my people; their song all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He hath sated me with bitterness, he hath made me drunk with wormwood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I have forgotten prosperity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And I said, My strength is perished, and my hope in Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Remember thou mine affliction and my wandering, the wormwood and the gall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My soul hath [them] constantly in remembrance, and is humbled in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">This I recall to heart, therefore have I hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">It is of Jehovah’s loving-kindness we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">they are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Jehovah is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Jehovah is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul [that] seeketh him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">It is good that one should both wait, and that in silence, for the salvation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He sitteth solitary and keepeth silence, because he hath laid it upon him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">he putteth his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">he giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him; he is filled full with reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For the Lord will not cast off for ever;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">but if he have caused grief, he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">for he doth not willingly afflict or grieve the children of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">to turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">to wrong a man in his cause,—will not the Lord see it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Who is he that saith, and there cometh to pass, what the Lord hath not commanded?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">Out of the mouth of the Most High doth not there proceed evil and good?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Let us lift up our heart with [our] hands unto God in the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">Thou hast covered thyself with anger, and pursued us; thou hast slain, thou hast not spared.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that prayer should not pass through.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Thou hast made us the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">All our enemies have opened their mouth against us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">Fear and the pit are come upon us, devastation and ruin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">Mine eye runneth down with streams of water for the ruin of the daughter of my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">Mine eye poureth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">till Jehovah look down and behold from the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">Mine eye affecteth my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">They that are mine enemies without cause have chased me sore like a bird.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">They have cut off my life in a pit, and cast a stone upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">Waters streamed over my head; I said, I am cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">I called upon thy name, Jehovah, out of the lowest pit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my sighing, at my cry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="57">Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee; thou saidst, Fear not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="58">Lord, thou hast pleaded the cause of my soul, thou hast redeemed my life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="59">Jehovah, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="60">Thou hast seen all their vengeance, all their imaginations against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="61">Thou hast heard their reproach, O Jehovah, all their imaginations against me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="62">the lips of those that rise up against me and their meditation against me all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="63">Behold thou their sitting down and their rising up: I am their song.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="64">Render unto them a recompence, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="65">give them obduracy of heart, thy curse unto them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="66">pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Jehovah.</p>
