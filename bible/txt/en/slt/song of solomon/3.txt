1	Upon my bed in the night I sought him whom my soul loved: I sought him, and I found him not.
2	I will arise now, and I will go round about in the city; in the streets, and in the broad places I will seek him whom my soul loved. I sought him, and I found him not.
3	They watching going about in the city, found me: Saw ye him that my soul loved?
4	As a little I passed from them till I found him my soul loved: I held him fast, and I shall not let him go till I brought him into my motherâ€™s house, and to the chamber of her conceiving me.
5	I adjured you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, if ye shall awake and if ye shall arouse love till he shall desire.
6	Who is this coming up from the desert as columns of smoke of burning incense, of myrrh and frankincense from all the powder of the trader.
7	Behold his bed of Solomon: sixty strong ones round about it from the strong ones of Israel.
8	All of them holding the sword, being trained to war: each his sword upon his thigh from terror in the night.
9	King Solomon made for himself a litter from the woods of Lebanon.
10	Its pillars he made silver, its support gold, its seat reddish purple, its midst tesselated with love from the daughters of Jerusalem.
11	Go forth, ye daughters of Zion, and look upon king Solomon; upon the crown his mother crowned to him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.
