<chapter book="Job" number="6" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But Job, responding, said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">I wish that my sins, for which I deserve wrath, and the calamity that I endure, were weighed out on a balance.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Compared to the sand of the sea, they would appear heavier, and so my words are full of sorrow.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For the arrows of the Lord are in me, my spirit drinks of their indignation, and the terrors of the Lord are soldiers against me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Will the wild ass bray when he has grass? Or will the ox bellow when he stands before a full manger?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Or can one eat bland food, which is not seasoned with salt? Or can anyone taste that which, if tasted, causes death?</verse>
  <verse number="7">The things that my soul was unwilling to touch before, now, because of anguish, are my foods.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Who will grant that my petition may arrive and that God may bestow on me what I expect,</verse>
  <verse number="9">and that he who, at first, had crushed me, will let loose his hand and cut me down?</verse>
  <verse number="10">And may this be my consolation, that in afflicting me with sorrow, although he might not be lenient with me, I still do not contradict the words of the Holy One.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For what is my strength, that I may continue? Or what is my goal, so that I may act patiently?</verse>
  <verse number="12">My strength is not the strength of stones, nor is my flesh made of bronze.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Behold, there is no help for me in myself, and my loved ones also have withdrawn from me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He who takes away mercy from his friend, abandons the fear of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="15">My brethren have disregarded me, like a torrent that passes swiftly through the steep valleys.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Those who fear frost, snow will rush over them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">At that time, when they are scattered, they will perish, and when it becomes hot, they will be freed from their place.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The paths of their steps are entangled; they will walk in vain and will perish.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Consider the paths of Thema, the ways of Saba, and wait a little while.</verse>
  <verse number="20">They have been thrown into confusion, just as I had hoped; they have even come to me and are overwhelmed with shame.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Now you have arrived, and merely by seeing my affliction, you are afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Did I say: “Bring to me and give to me from your necessities?”</verse>
  <verse number="23">or, “Free me from the hand of the enemy and rescue me from the hand of the strong?”</verse>
  <verse number="24">Teach me, and I will be silent, and if by chance I have been ignorant of anything, instruct me.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Why have you diminished the words of truth, when there is none of you who is able to offer proof against me?</verse>
  <verse number="26">You prepare speeches as so much noise, and you offer words into the wind.</verse>
  <verse number="27">You encroach upon the orphan, and you strive to undermine your friend.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Such is true, so finish what you have begun. Listen closely, and see if I lie.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Respond, I beg you, without contention, and, speaking what is just, pass judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And you will not find iniquity on my tongue, nor will foolishness resound in my throat.</verse>
