<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith to him, They have no wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Jesus saith to her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? my hour is not yet come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">His mother saith to the servants, Whatever he saith to you, do it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Jesus saith to them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them to the brim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he saith to them, Draw out now, and bear to the governor of the feast. And they bore it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was; (but the servants who drew the water knew) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And saith to him, Every man at the beginning presenteth good wine; and when men have well drank, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">This beginning of miracles Jesus performed in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples; and they continued there not many days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And found in the temple those that sold oxen, and sheep, and doves, and the changers of money, sitting:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers’ money, and overthrew the tables;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And said to them that sold doves, Take these things hence: make not my Father’s house a house of merchandise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thy house hath eaten me up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then answered the Jews, and said to him, What sign showest thou to us, seeing that thou doest these things?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But he spoke of the temple of his body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">When therefore he had risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this to them: and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had spoken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he performed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But Jesus did not commit himself to them, because he knew all men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And needed not that any should testify concerning man: for he knew what was in man.</p>
