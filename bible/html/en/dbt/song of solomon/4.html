<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; Thine eyes are doves behind thy veil; Thy hair is as a flock of goats, On the slopes of mount Gilead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thy teeth are like a flock of shorn sheep, Which go up from the washing; Which have all borne twins, And none is barren among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, And thy speech is comely; As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples Behind thy veil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thy neck is like the tower of David, Built for an armoury: A thousand bucklers hang thereon, All shields of mighty men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thy two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle, Which feed among the lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Until the day dawn, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, And to the hill of frankincense.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thou art all fair, my love; And there is no spot in thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">[Come] with me, from Lebanon, [my] spouse, With me from Lebanon,—Come, look from the top of Amanah, From the top of Senir and Hermon, From the lions’ dens, From the mountains of the leopards.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, [my] spouse; Thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, With one chain of thy neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">How fair is thy love, my sister, [my] spouse! How much better is thy love than wine! And the fragrance of thine ointments than all spices!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Thy lips, [my] spouse, drop [as] the honeycomb; Honey and milk are under thy tongue; And the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A garden enclosed is my sister, [my] spouse; A spring shut up, a fountain sealed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Thy shoots are a paradise of pomegranates, with precious fruits; Henna with spikenard plants;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Spikenard and saffron; Calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; Myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">A fountain in the gardens, A well of living waters, Which stream from Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Awake, north wind, and come, [thou] south; Blow upon my garden, [that] the spices thereof may flow forth. Let my beloved come into his garden, And eat its precious fruits.</p>
