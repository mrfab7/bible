<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I call upon you, therefore, brethren, through the compassions of God, to present your bodies a sacrifice—living, sanctified, acceptable to God—your intelligent service;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and be not conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, for your proving what is the will of God—the good, and acceptable, and perfect.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I say, through the grace that was given to me, to every one who is among you, not to think above what it behoveth to think; but to think so as to think wisely, as to each God did deal a measure of faith,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">for as in one body we have many members, and all the members have not the same office,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">so we, the many, one body are in Christ, and members each one of one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And having gifts, different according to the grace that was given to us; whether prophecy—‘According to the proportion of faith!’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">or ministration—‘In the ministration!’ or he who is teaching—‘In the teaching!’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">or he who is exhorting—‘In the exhortation!’ he who is sharing—‘In simplicity!’ he who is leading—‘In diligence?’ he who is doing kindness—‘In cheerfulness.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The love unfeigned: abhorring the evil; cleaving to the good;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">in the love of brethren, to one another kindly affectioned: in the honour going before one another;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">in the diligence not slothful; in the spirit fervent; the Lord serving;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">in the hope rejoicing; in the tribulation enduring; in the prayer persevering;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">to the necessities of the saints communicating; the hospitality pursuing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Bless those persecuting you; bless, and curse not;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">to rejoice with the rejoicing, and to weep with the weeping,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">of the same mind one toward another, not minding the high things, but with the lowly going along; become not wise in your own conceit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">giving back to no one evil for evil; providing right things before all men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If possible—so far as in you—with all men being in peace;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">not avenging yourselves, beloved, but give place to the wrath, for it hath been written, ‘Vengeance is Mine,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I will recompense again, saith the Lord;’ if, then, thine enemy doth hunger, feed him; if he doth thirst, give him drink; for this doing, coals of fire thou shalt heap upon his head;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Be not overcome by the evil, but overcome, in the good, the evil.</p>
