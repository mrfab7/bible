<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now him that is weak in the faith receive, not to [the] determining of questions of reasoning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">One man is assured that he may eat all things; but the weak eats herbs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Let not him that eats make little of him that eats not; and let not him that eats not judge him that eats: for God has received him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who art thou that judgest the servant of another? to his own master he stands or falls. And he shall be made to stand; for the Lord is able to make him stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">One man esteems day more than day; another esteems every day [alike]. Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He that regards the day, regards it to [the] Lord. And he that eats, eats to [the] Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he that does not eat, [it is] to [the] Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For none of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For both if we should live, [it is] to the Lord we live; and if we should die, [it is] to the Lord we die: both if we should live then, and if we should die, we are the Lordâ€™s.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For to this [end] Christ has died and lived [again], that he might rule over both dead and living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? or again, thou, why dost thou make little of thy brother? for we shall all be placed before the judgment-seat of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For it is written, I live, saith [the] Lord, that to me shall bow every knee, and every tongue shall confess to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">So then each of us shall give an account concerning himself to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Let us no longer therefore judge one another; but judge ye this rather, not to put a stumbling-block or a fall-trap before his brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; except to him who reckons anything to be unclean, to that man [it is] unclean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For if on account of meat thy brother is grieved, thou walkest no longer according to love. Destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ has died.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let not then your good be evil spoken of;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in [the] Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For he that in this serves the Christ [is] acceptable to God and approved of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">So then let us pursue the things which tend to peace, and things whereby one shall build up another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For the sake of meat do not destroy the work of God. All things indeed [are] pure; but [it is] evil to that man who eats while stumbling [in doing so].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">[It is] right not to eat meat, nor drink wine, nor [do anything] in which thy brother stumbles, or is offended, or is weak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Hast thou faith? have [it] to thyself before God. Blessed [is] he who does not judge himself in what he allows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But he that doubts, if he eat, is condemned; because [it is] not of faith; but whatever [is] not of faith is sin.</p>
