<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When Israel was a child, then I loved him, And out of Egypt I called My son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The more they called them, the more they went from them; They sacrificed unto the Baalim, And offered to graven images.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I, I taught Ephraim to walk, Taking them by their arms; But they knew not that I healed them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I drew them with cords of a man, With bands of love; And I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, And I fed them gently.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He shall not return into the land of Egypt, But the Assyrian shall be his king, Because they refused to return.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the sword shall fall upon his cities, And shall consume his bars, and devour them, Because of their own counsels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And My people are in suspense about returning to Me; And though they call them upwards, None at all will lift himself up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? How shall I surrender thee, Israel? How shall I make thee as Admah? How shall I set thee as Zeboim? My heart is turned within Me, My compassions are kindled together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I will not execute the fierceness of Mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim; For I am God, and not man, The Holy One in the midst of thee; And I will not come in fury.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They shall walk after the LORD, Who shall roar like a lion; For He shall roar, And the children shall come trembling from the west.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They shall come trembling as a bird out of Egypt, And as a dove out of the land of Assyria; And I will make them to dwell in their houses, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Ephraim compasseth Me about with lies, And the house of Israel with deceit; And Judah is yet wayward towards God, And towards the Holy One who is faithful.</p>
