  <verse number="1">Observe the month Abib, and keep the passover to the LORD thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth from Egypt by night.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover to the LORD thy God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD shall choose to place his name there.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread with it, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth from the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth from the land of Egypt, all the days of thy life.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy borders seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh, which thou didst sacrifice the first day at evening, remain all night until the morning.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at evening, at the setting of the sun, at the time of thy departure from Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go to thy tents.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt do no work.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Seven weeks shalt thou number to thee: begin to number the seven weeks from the time when thou beginnest to put the sickle to the corn.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks to the LORD thy God with a tribute of a free-will-offering of thy hand, which thou shalt give to the LORD thy God, according as the LORD thy God hath blessed thee:</verse>
  <verse number="11">And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place his name there.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bond-man in Egypt: and thou shalt observe and do these statutes.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that thou hast gathered in thy corn, and thy wine.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are within thy gates:</verse>
  <verse number="15">Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast to the LORD thy God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy increase, and in all the works of thy hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the LORD empty:</verse>
  <verse number="17">Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and they shall judge the people with just judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons, neither take a gift; for a gift doth blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.</verse>
  <verse number="20">That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near to the altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make for thee.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the LORD thy God hateth.</verse>
