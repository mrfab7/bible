<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Elihu answereth and saith:—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">This hast thou reckoned for judgment: Thou hast said—‘My righteousness is more than God’s?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For thou sayest, ‘What doth it profit Thee! What do I profit from my sin?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I return thee words, and thy friends with thee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Behold attentively the heavens—and see, And behold the clouds, They have been higher than thou.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If thou hast sinned, what dost thou against Him? And thy transgressions have been multiplied, What dost thou to Him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If thou hast been righteous, What dost thou give to Him? Or what from thy hand doth He receive?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For a man like thyself is thy wickedness, And for a son of man thy righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Because of the multitude of oppressions They cause to cry out, They cry because of the arm of the mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And none said, ‘Where is God my maker? Giving songs in the night,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Teaching us more than the beasts of the earth, Yea, than the fowl of the heavens He maketh us wiser.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">There they cry, and He doth not answer, Because of the pride of evil doers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Surely vanity God doth not hear, And the Mighty doth not behold it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Yea, though thou sayest thou dost not behold Him, Judgment is before Him, and stay for Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And, now, because there is not, He hath appointed His anger, And He hath not known in great extremity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Job with vanity doth open his mouth, Without knowledge words he multiplieth.</p>
