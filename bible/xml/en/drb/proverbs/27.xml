  <verse number="1">Boast not for to morrow, for thou knowest not what the day to come may bring forth.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Let another praise thee, and not thy own mouth: a stranger, and not thy own lips.</verse>
  <verse number="3">A stone is heavy, and sand weighty: but the anger of a fool is heavier than them both.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Anger hath no mercy, nor fury when it breaketh forth: and who can bear the violence of one provoked?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Open rebuke is better than hidden love.</verse>

  <verse number="9">Ointment and perfumes rejoice the heart: and the good counsels of a friend are sweet to the soul.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Thy own friend, and thy father’s friend forsake not: and go not into thy brother’s house in the day of thy affliction. Better is a neighbour that is near, than a brother afar off.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Study wisdom, my son, and make my heart joyful, that thou mayst give an answer to him that reproacheth.</verse>

  <verse number="20">Hell and destruction are never filled: so the eyes of men are never satisfied.</verse>
  <verse number="21">As silver is tried in the fining-pot and gold in the furnace: so a man is tried by the mouth of him that praiseth. The heart of the wicked seeketh after evils, but the righteous heart seeketh after knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Though thou shouldst bray a fool in the mortar, as when a pestle striketh upon sodden barley, his folly would not be taken from him.</verse>
