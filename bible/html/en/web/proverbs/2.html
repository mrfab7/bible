<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, if you will receive my words, and store up my commandments within you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">So as to turn your ear to wisdom, and apply your heart to understanding;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Yes, if you call out for discernment, and lift up your voice for understanding;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If you seek her as silver, and search for her as for hidden treasures:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">then you will understand the fear of Yahweh, and find the knowledge of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For Yahweh gives wisdom. Out of his mouth comes knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He lays up sound wisdom for the upright. He is a shield to those who walk in integrity;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">that he may guard the paths of justice, and preserve the way of his saints.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then you will understand righteousness and justice, equity and every good path.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For wisdom will enter into your heart. Knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Discretion will watch over you. Understanding will keep you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">to deliver you from the way of evil, from the men who speak perverse things;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">who forsake the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the perverseness of evil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">who are crooked in their ways, and wayward in their paths:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">To deliver you from the strange woman, even from the foreigner who flatters with her words;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">who forsakes the friend of her youth, and forgets the covenant of her God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">for her house leads down to death, her paths to the dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">None who go to her return again, neither do they attain to the paths of life:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">that you may walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the upright will dwell in the land. The perfect will remain in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But the wicked will be cut off from the land. The treacherous will be rooted out of it.</p>
