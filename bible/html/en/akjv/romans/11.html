<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I say then, Has God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">God has not cast away his people which he foreknew. Know you not what the scripture said of Elias? how he makes intercession to God against Israel saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Lord, they have killed your prophets, and dig down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But what said the answer of God to him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">What then? Israel has not obtained that which he seeks for; but the election has obtained it, and the rest were blinded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">(According as it is written, God has given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) to this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And David said, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompense to them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back always.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come to the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify my office:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For if the first fruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And if some of the branches be broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Boast not against the branches. But if you boast, you bore not the root, but the root you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">You will say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Be not high minded, but fear:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness: otherwise you also shall be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For if you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For this is my covenant to them, when I shall take away their sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fatherâ€™s sakes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">For as you in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For God has concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy on all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For who has known the mind of the Lord? or who has been his counselor?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Or who has first given to him, and it shall be recompensed to him again?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.</p>
