<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After these words and the truth, came Senherib king of Assur, and he will come into Judah, and will encamp against the fortified cities, and say to divide them for himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Hezekiah will see that Senherib came, and his face for war against Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he will take counsel with his chiefs and his strong ones to stop the waters of the fountains which were without to the city: and they will help him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And much people will be gathered together, and they will stop all the fountains, and the torrent gushing through the midst of the land, saving, Wherefore shall the kings of Assur come and find many waters?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And he will strengthen himself and build all the wall broken down, and he will go up upon the towers, and to without another wall, and he will strengthen the filling up of the city of David, and he will make darts for abundance, and shields.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he will give chiefs of the war over the people, and he will gather them together to him to the street of the gate of the city, and he will speak to their heart, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Be strong and be firm ye shall not fear and ye shall not be terrified-from the face of the king of Assur, and from before all the multitude which are with him: for with us much more than with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">With him an arm of flesh; and with us Jehovah our God to help, and to war our wars. And the people will lean upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">After this Senherib king of Assur sent his servants to Jerusalem (and he at Lachish, and all his dominion with him) to Hezekiah king of Judah, and against all Judah which were in Jerusalem, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thus said Senherib king of Assur, Upon what are ye trusting, and dwelling in the fortress in Jerusalem?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Is not Hezekiah stimulating you to give yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, Jehovah our God will deliver us from the hand of the king of Assur?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Did not this Hezekiah remove his heights, and his altars? and he will say to Judah and to Jerusalem, saying, Before one altar shall ye worship and upon it shall ye burn incense?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Will ye not know what I did, I and my fathers, to all the peoples of the lands? Being able, were the gods of the nations of the lands able to deliver their land from my hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Who from all the gods of these nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, which were able to deliver his people from my hand, that your God shall be able to deliver you from my hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And now Hezekiah shall not deceive you, and he shall not stimulate you according to this, and ye shall not believe upon him: for not any God of any nation and kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand, and out of the hand of my father: much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And yet spake his servants against Jehovah God, and against Hezekiah his servant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he wrote letters to reproach to Jehovah God of Israel, and to say against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of the lands who delivered not their people from my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people from my hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And they will call with a great voice in Judaic to the people of Jerusalem which were upon the wall, to cause them to fear and to terrify them, so that they shall take the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And they will speak against the God of Jerusalem as against the gods of the peoples of the land, the work of the hand of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Hezekiah the king will pray, and Isaiah the prophet, son of Amos, for this, and they will cry to the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Jehovah will send a messenger, and he will cut off every strong one of power, and leader and chief in the camp of the king of Assur. And he will turn back with shame of face to his land. And he will come into the house of his God, and they coming forth from his bowels caused him to fall there by the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Jehovah will save Hezekiah, and those inhabiting Jerusalem, from the hand of Senherib king of Assur, and from the hand of all, and protect them from round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And many bringing a gift to Jehovah to Jerusalem, and precious things to Hezekiah king of Judah: and he will be lifted up to the eyes of all the nations from after this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">In those days Hezekiah was sick even to death, and he will pray to Jehovah: and he will say to him, and be gave to him a sign.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And not according to the doing to him did Hezekiah turn back, for his heart was lifted up: and there will be wrath upon him, and upon Judah and upon Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And Hezekiah will humble himself for the lifting up of his heart, he and those inhabiting Jerusalem, and the wrath of Jehovah came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And there will be to Hezekiah riches and honor exceedingly much: and he made to him treasuries for silver and for gold, and for precious stone, and for spices and for shields, and for all vessels of desire:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And stores for produce of grain and new wine, and new oil, and stalls for all cattle, and cattle and flocks for the stalls.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And he made cities to him and possession of flocks and oxen for abundance: for God gave to him exceeding much substance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And this Hezekiah stopped the going forth of the waters of Gihon the highest, and he will make them straight down from the west to the city of David. And Hezekiah will prosper in all his work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Thus in the chiefs of Babel interceding, sending to him to seek out the sign which was in the land, God left him, to try him, to know all in his heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And the rest of the words of Hezekiah and his mercies, behold them written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, son of Amos, upon the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And Hezekiah will lie down with his fathers, and they will bury him in the ascent of the graves of the sons of David: and all Judah and those inhabiting Jerusalem did honor to him in his death: and Manasseh his son will reign in his stead.</p>
