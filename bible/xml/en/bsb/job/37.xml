  <verse number="1">“At this my heart also pounds and leaps from its place.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Listen closely to the thunder of His voice and the rumbling that comes from His mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">He unleashes His lightning beneath the whole sky and sends it to the ends of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then there comes a roaring sound; He thunders with His majestic voice. He does not restrain the lightning when His voice resounds.</verse>
  <verse number="5">God thunders wondrously with His voice; He does great things we cannot comprehend.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For He says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’ and to the gentle rain, ‘Pour out a mighty downpour.’</verse>
  <verse number="7">He seals up the hand of every man, so that all men may know His work.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The wild animals enter their lairs; they settle down in their dens.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The tempest comes from its chamber, and the cold from the driving north winds.</verse>
  <verse number="10">By the breath of God the ice is formed and the watery expanses are frozen.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He loads the clouds with moisture; He scatters His lightning through them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">They swirl about, whirling at His direction, accomplishing all that He commands over the face of all the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Whether for punishment or for His land, He accomplishes this in His loving devotion.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Listen to this, O Job; stand still and consider the wonders of God.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Do you know how God dispatches the clouds or makes the lightning flash?</verse>
  <verse number="16">Do you understand how the clouds float, those wonders of Him who is perfect in knowledge?</verse>
  <verse number="17">You whose clothes get hot when the land lies hushed under the south wind,</verse>
  <verse number="18">can you, like Him, spread out the skies, as strong as a mirror of bronze?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Teach us what we should say to Him; we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Should He be told that I want to speak? Would a man ask to be swallowed up?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Now no one can gaze at the sun when it is bright in the skies after the wind has swept them clean.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Out of the north He comes in golden splendor; awesome majesty surrounds Him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The Almighty is beyond our reach; He is exalted in power! In His justice and great righteousness He does not oppress.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore, men fear Him, for He is not partial to the wise in heart.”</verse>
