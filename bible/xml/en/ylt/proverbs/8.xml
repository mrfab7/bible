<chapter book="Proverbs" number="8" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Doth not wisdom call? And understanding give forth her voice?</verse>
  <verse number="2">At the head of high places by the way, Between the paths she hath stood,</verse>
  <verse number="3">At the side of the gates, at the mouth of the city, The entrance of the openings, she crieth aloud,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Unto you, O men, I call, And my voice is unto the sons of men.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Understand, ye simple ones, prudence, And ye fools, understand the heart,</verse>
  <verse number="6">Hearken, for noble things I speak, And the opening of my lips is uprightness.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For truth doth my mouth utter, And an abomination to my lips is wickedness.</verse>
  <verse number="8">In righteousness are all the sayings of my mouth, Nothing in them is froward and perverse.</verse>
  <verse number="9">All of them are plain to the intelligent, And upright to those finding knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Receive my instruction, and not silver, And knowledge rather than choice gold.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For better is wisdom than rubies, Yea, all delights are not comparable with it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I, wisdom, have dwelt with prudence, And a knowledge of devices I find out.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil; Pride, and arrogance, and an evil way, And a froward mouth, I have hated.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Mine is counsel and substance, I am understanding, I have might.</verse>
  <verse number="15">By me kings reign, and princes decree righteousness,</verse>
  <verse number="16">By me do chiefs rule, and nobles, All judges of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I love those loving me, And those seeking me earnestly do find me.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Wealth and honour are with me, Lasting substance and righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Better is my fruit than gold, even fine gold, And mine increase than choice silver.</verse>
  <verse number="20">In a path of righteousness I cause to walk, In midst of paths of judgment,</verse>
  <verse number="21">To cause my lovers to inherit substance, Yea, their treasures I fill.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Jehovah possessed me—the beginning of His way, Before His works since then.</verse>
  <verse number="23">From the age I was anointed, from the first, From former states of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="24">In there being no depths, I was brought forth, In there being no fountains heavy with waters,</verse>
  <verse number="25">Before mountains were sunk, Before heights, I was brought forth.</verse>
  <verse number="26">While He had not made the earth, and out-places, And the top of the dusts of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="27">In His preparing the heavens I am there, In His decreeing a circle on the face of the deep,</verse>
  <verse number="28">In His strengthening clouds above, In His making strong fountains of the deep,</verse>
  <verse number="29">In His setting for the sea its limit, And the waters transgress not His command, In His decreeing the foundations of earth,</verse>
  <verse number="30">Then I am near Him, a workman, And I am a delight—day by day. Rejoicing before Him at all times,</verse>
  <verse number="31">Rejoicing in the habitable part of His earth, And my delights are with the sons of men.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And now, ye sons, hearken to me, Yea, happy are they who keep my ways.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Hear instruction, and be wise, and slight not.</verse>
  <verse number="34">O the happiness of the man hearkening to me, To watch at my doors day by day, To watch at the door-posts of my entrance.</verse>
  <verse number="35">For whoso is finding me, hath found life, And bringeth out good-will from Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And whoso is missing me, is wronging his soul, All hating me have loved death!</verse>
