<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Therefore, since God in His mercy has given us this ministry, we do not lose heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Instead, we have renounced secret and shameful ways. We do not practice deceit, nor do we distort the word of God. On the contrary, by open proclamation of the truth, we commend ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus’ sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For God, who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,” made His light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Now we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this surpassingly great power is from God and not from us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">We are hard pressed on all sides, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">We always carry around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For we who are alive are always consigned to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our mortal body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">So then, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And in keeping with what is written, “I believed, therefore I have spoken,” we who have the same spirit of faith also believe and therefore speak,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">knowing that the One who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and present us with you in His presence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All this is for your benefit, so that the grace that is extending to more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow, to the glory of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Therefore we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, yet our inner self is being renewed day by day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For our light and momentary affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory that is far beyond comparison.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen. For what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal.</p>
