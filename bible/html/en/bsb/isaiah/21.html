<p class="verse" data-verse="1">This is the burden against the Desert by the Sea: Like whirlwinds sweeping through the Negev, an invader comes from the desert, from a land of terror.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A dire vision is declared to me: “The traitor still betrays, and the destroyer still destroys. Go up, O Elam! Lay siege, O Media! I will put an end to all her groaning.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Therefore my body is filled with anguish. Pain grips me, like the pains of a woman in labor. I am bewildered to hear, I am dismayed to see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">My heart falters; fear makes me tremble. The twilight I desired has turned to horror.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">They prepare a table, they lay out a carpet, they eat, they drink! Rise up, O princes, oil the shields!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For this is what the Lord says to me: “Go, post a lookout and have him report what he sees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When he sees chariots with teams of horsemen, riders on donkeys, riders on camels, he must be alert, fully alert.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then the lookout shouted: “Day after day, my lord, I stand on the watchtower; night after night I stay at my post.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Look, here come the riders, horsemen in pairs.” And one answered, saying: “Fallen, fallen is Babylon! All the images of her gods lie shattered on the ground!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">O my people, crushed on the threshing floor, I tell you what I have heard from the LORD of Hosts, the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">This is the burden against Dumah: One calls to me from Seir, “Watchman, what is left of the night? Watchman, what is left of the night?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The watchman replies, “Morning has come, but also the night. If you would inquire, then inquire. Come back yet again.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">This is the burden against Arabia: In the thickets of Arabia you must lodge, O caravans of Dedanites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Bring water for the thirsty, O dwellers of Tema; meet the refugees with food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For they flee from the sword—the sword that is drawn—from the bow that is bent, and from the stress of battle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For this is what the Lord says to me: “Within one year, as a hired worker would count it, all the glory of Kedar will be gone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The remaining archers, the warriors of Kedar, will be few.” For the LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken.</p>
