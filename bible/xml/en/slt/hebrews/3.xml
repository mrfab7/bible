  <verse number="1">Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, observe the sent and Chief Priest of our assent, Christ Jesus;</verse>
  <verse number="2">Faithful to him having made him, as also Moses in his whole house.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For this was deemed worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he has greater honour of the house having built it.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For every house is built by somebody; and he having built all things, God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And truly Moses faithful in his whole house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things to be spoken;</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Christ as a son over his house: whose house are we, if we should hold freedom of speech and the boast of hope firm to the end.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Wherefore (as the Holy Spirit says, If to day ye hear his voice,</verse>
  <verse number="8">Harden not your hearts, as in the exasperation, in the day of trial in the desert:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Where your fathers tried me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Wherefore I was offended with that generation and I said, They always wander in heart; and they knew not my ways.</verse>
  <verse number="11">As I aware in my wrath, If they shall come into my rest.)</verse>
  <verse number="12">See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in removing away from the living God.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But beseech one another according to each day, as far as the day is called; lest any of you be hardened by deceit of sin.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For we have been partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our foundation firm to the end;</verse>
  <verse number="15">In that it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, ye should not harden your hearts, as in the exasperation.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For some, having heard, did exasperate: but not all they having come out of Egypt by Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And with whom was he offended forty years? was it not with them having sinned, whose members fell in the desert?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And to whom sware he that they could not come into his rest, if not to them having been disobedient?</verse>
  <verse number="19">And we see they could not come in through unbelief.</verse>
