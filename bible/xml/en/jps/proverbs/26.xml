  <verse number="1">As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, So honour is not seemly for a fool.</verse>
  <verse number="2">As the wandering sparrow, as the flying swallow, So the curse that is causeless shall come home.</verse>
  <verse number="3">A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, And a rod for the back of fools.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Answer not a fool according to his folly, Lest thou also be like unto him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Answer a fool according to his folly, Lest he be wise in his own eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool Cutteth off his own feet, and drinketh damage.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The legs hang limp from the lame; So is a parable in the mouth of fools.</verse>
  <verse number="8">As a small stone in a heap of stones, So is he that giveth honour to a fool.</verse>
  <verse number="9">As a thorn that cometh into the hand of a drunkard, So is a parable in the mouth of fools.</verse>
  <verse number="10">A master performeth all things; But he that stoppeth a fool is as one that stoppeth a flood.</verse>
  <verse number="11">As a dog that returneth to his vomit, So is a fool that repeateth his folly.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Seest thou a man wise in his own eyes? There is more hope of a fool than of him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The sluggard saith: ‘There is a lion in the way; Yea, a lion is in the streets.’</verse>
  <verse number="14">The door is turning upon its hinges, And the sluggard is still upon his bed.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish; It wearieth him to bring it back to his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes Than seven men that give wise answer.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife not his own, Is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.</verse>
  <verse number="18">As a madman who casteth firebrands, Arrows, and death;</verse>
  <verse number="19">So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, And saith: ‘Am not I in sport?’</verse>
  <verse number="20">Where no wood is, the fire goeth out; And where there is no whisperer, contention ceaseth.</verse>
  <verse number="21">As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; So is a contentious man to kindle strife.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The words of a whisperer are as dainty morsels, And they go down into the innermost parts of the body.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Burning lips and a wicked heart Are like an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, But he layeth up deceit within him.</verse>
  <verse number="25">When he speaketh fair, Believe him not; For there are seven abominations in his heart.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Though his hatred be concealed with deceit, His wickedness shall be revealed before the congregation.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein; And he that rolleth a stone, it shall return upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="28">A lying tongue hateth those that are crushed by it; And a flattering mouth worketh ruin.</verse>
