<chapter book="Job" number="7" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Hath not man a life of labour upon earth? and are not his days like the days of a hireling?</verse>
  <verse number="2">As a bondman earnestly desireth the shadow, and a hireling expecteth his wages,</verse>
  <verse number="3">So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">If I lie down, I say, When shall I rise up, and the darkness be gone? and I am full of tossings until the dawn.</verse>
  <verse number="5">My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and suppurates.</verse>
  <verse number="6">My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Remember thou that my life is wind; mine eye shall no more see good.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The eye of him that hath seen me shall behold me no [more]: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The cloud consumeth and vanisheth away; so he that goeth down to Sheol shall not come up.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him again.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Therefore I will not restrain my mouth: I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, that thou settest a watch over me?</verse>
  <verse number="13">When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions;</verse>
  <verse number="15">So that my soul chooseth strangling, death, rather than my bones.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I loathe it; I shall not live always: let me alone, for my days are a breath.</verse>
  <verse number="17">What is man, that thou makest much of him? and that thou settest thy heart upon him?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And that thou visitest him every morning, triest him every moment?</verse>
  <verse number="19">How long wilt thou not look away from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Have I sinned, what do I unto thee, thou Observer of men? Why hast thou set me as an object of assault for thee, so that I am become a burden to myself?</verse>
  <verse number="21">And why dost not thou forgive my transgression and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I lie down in the dust, and thou shalt seek me early, and I shall not be.</verse>
