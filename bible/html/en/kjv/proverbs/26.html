<p class="verse" data-verse="1">As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the foolâ€™s back.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, [and] drinketh damage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The legs of the lame are not equal: so [is] a parable in the mouth of fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so [is] he that giveth honour to a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">[As] a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so [is] a parable in the mouth of fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The great [God] that formed all [things] both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">As a dog returneth to his vomit, [so] a fool returneth to his folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? [there is] more hope of a fool than of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The slothful [man] saith, [There is] a lion in the way; a lion [is] in the streets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">[As] the door turneth upon his hinges, so [doth] the slothful upon his bed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The slothful hideth his hand in [his] bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The sluggard [is] wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He that passeth by, [and] meddleth with strife [belonging] not to him, [is like] one that taketh a dog by the ears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">As a mad [man] who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">So [is] the man [that] deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Where no wood is, [there] the fire goeth out: so where [there is] no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">[As] coals [are] to burning coals, and wood to fire; so [is] a contentious man to kindle strife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The words of a talebearer [are] as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Burning lips and a wicked heart [are like] a potsherd covered with silver dross.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for [there are] seven abominations in his heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">[Whose] hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the [whole] congregation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A lying tongue hateth [those that are] afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.</p>
