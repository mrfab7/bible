<div class="chapter" data-book="Micah" data-chapter="2" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Woe to those who devise iniquity and plot evil on their beds! At morning’s light they accomplish it because the power is in their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">They covet fields and seize them; they take away houses. They deprive a man of his home, a fellow man of his inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Therefore this is what the LORD says: “I am planning against this nation a disaster from which you cannot free your necks. Then you will not walk so proudly, for it will be a time of calamity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">In that day they will take up a proverb against you and taunt you with this bitter lamentation: ‘We are utterly ruined! He has changed the portion of my people. How He has removed it from me! He has allotted our fields to traitors.’”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Therefore, you will have no one in the assembly of the LORD to divide the land by lot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">“Do not preach,” they preach. “Do not preach these things; disgrace will not overtake us.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Should it be said, O house of Jacob, “Is the Spirit of the LORD impatient? Are these the things He does?” Do not My words bring good to him who walks uprightly?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But of late My people have risen up like an enemy: You strip off the splendid robe from unsuspecting passersby like men returning from battle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">You drive the women of My people from their pleasant homes. You take away My blessing from their children forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Arise and depart, for this is not your place of rest, because its defilement brings destruction—a grievous destruction!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If a man of wind were to come and say falsely, “I will preach to you of wine and strong drink,” he would be just the preacher for this people!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I will surely gather all of you, O Jacob; I will collect the remnant of Israel. I will bring them together like sheep in a pen, like a flock in the midst of its pasture—a noisy throng.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">One who breaks open the way will go up before them; they will break through the gate, and go out by it. Their King will pass through before them, the LORD as their leader.</p>
