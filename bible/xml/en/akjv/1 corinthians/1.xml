<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="1" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,</verse>
  <verse number="2">To the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and our’s:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="5">That in every thing you are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;</verse>
  <verse number="6">Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:</verse>
  <verse number="7">So that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="8">Who shall also confirm you to the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="9">God is faithful, by whom you were called to the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Now I beseech you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For it has been declared to me of you, my brothers, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now this I say, that every one of you said, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</verse>
  <verse number="14">I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;</verse>
  <verse number="15">Lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but to us which are saved it is the power of God.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</verse>
  <verse number="21">For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:</verse>
  <verse number="23">But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness;</verse>
  <verse number="24">But to them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For you see your calling, brothers, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:</verse>
  <verse number="27">But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</verse>
  <verse number="28">And base things of the world, and things which are despised, has God chosen, yes, and things which are not, to bring to nothing things that are:</verse>
  <verse number="29">That no flesh should glory in his presence.</verse>
  <verse number="30">But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</verse>
  <verse number="31">That, according as it is written, He that glories, let him glory in the Lord.</verse>
