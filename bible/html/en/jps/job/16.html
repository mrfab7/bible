<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I have heard many such things; Sorry comforters are ye all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Shall windy words have an end? Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I also could speak as ye do; If your soul were in my soulâ€™s stead, I could join words together against you, And shake my head at you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I would strengthen you with my mouth, And the moving of my lips would assuage your grief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Though I speak, my pain is not assuaged; And though I forbear, what am I eased?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But now He hath made me weary; Thou hast made desolate all my company.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Thou hast shrivelled me up, which is a witness against me; And my leanness riseth up against me, it testifieth to my face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He hath torn me in His wrath, and hated me; He hath gnashed upon me with His teeth; Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They have gaped upon me with their mouth; They have smitten me upon the cheek scornfully; They gather themselves together against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">God delivereth me to the ungodly, And casteth me into the hands of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I was at ease, and He broke me asunder; Yea, He hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces; He hath also set me up for His mark.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">His archers compass me round about, He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; He poureth out my gall upon the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He breaketh me with breach upon breach; He runneth upon me like a giant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, And have laid my horn in the dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">My face is reddened with weeping, And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">O earth, cover not thou my blood, And let my cry have no resting-place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Even now, behold, my Witness is in heaven, And He that testifieth of me is on high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Mine inward thoughts are my intercessors, Mine eye poureth out tears unto God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">That He would set aright a man contending with God, As a son of man setteth aright his neighbour!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For the years that are few are coming on, And I shall go the way whence I shall not return.</p>
