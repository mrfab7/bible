<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="13" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I have been the brass of echoes, and the shouting cymbal.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And if I have the gift of prophecy, and know all mysteries, and all knowledge; and if I have all faith to remove mountains, and have not love, I am nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And if I feed out all my goods, and if I deliver my body that I be burned, and have not love, I am profited nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Love is slow to anger, possesses kindness; love envies not; love vaunts not itself, is not puffed up,</verse>
  <verse number="5">It demeans itself not unbecomingly, seeks not the things of itself, is not irritated, reckons no evil;</verse>
  <verse number="6">Rejoices not at injustice, and rejoices with the truth;</verse>
  <verse number="7">Covers all things, believes all, hopes all things, endures all.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Love never falters: but whether gifts of prophecies, they shall be left unemployed; whether tongues, they shall cease; whether knowledge, it shall be left unemployed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For we know by parts, and we prophesy by parts.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And when the perfected come, then shall that by parts be left unemployed.</verse>
  <verse number="11">When I was a child, as a child I spake, as a child I thought, as a child I reckoned: and when I had become a man, I left unemployed the things of a child.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For now we see by a mirror in an enigma; then face to face: now I know by parts; and then shall I know as I was known.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And now remains faith, hope, love, these three; and the greater of these, love.</verse>
