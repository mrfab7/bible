<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And he began to speak unto them by parables. A [certain] man planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about [it], and digged [a place for] the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into a far country.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they caught [him], and beat him, and sent [him] away empty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they cast stones, and wounded [him] in the head, and sent [him] away shamefully handled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others; beating some, and killing some.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And they took him, and killed [him], and cast [him] out of the vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">This was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left him, and went their way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to catch him in [his] words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may see [it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And they brought [it]. And he saith unto them, Whose [is] this image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar’s.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they marvelled at him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave [his] wife [behind him], and leave no children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and dying left no seed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed: and the third likewise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman died also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err, because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I [am] the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye therefore do greatly err.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments [is], Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this [is] the first commandment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And the second [is] like, [namely] this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love [his] neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that durst ask him [any question].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he [then] his son? And the common people heard him gladly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go in long clothing, and [love] salutations in the marketplaces,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Which devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And he called [unto him] his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">For all [they] did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, [even] all her living.</p>
