<chapter book="Hebrews" number="5" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">For every high priest taken from amongst men is established for men in things relating to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins;</verse>
  <verse number="2">being able to exercise forbearance towards the ignorant and erring, since he himself also is clothed with infirmity;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and, on account of this [infirmity], he ought, even as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And no one takes the honour to himself but [as] called by God, even as Aaron also.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thus the Christ also has not glorified himself to be made a high priest; but he who had said to him, Thou art my Son, I have to-day begotten thee.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Even as also in another [place] he says, Thou [art] a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Who in the days of his flesh, having offered up both supplications and entreaties to him who was able to save him out of death, with strong crying and tears; (and having been heard because of his piety;)</verse>
  <verse number="8">though he were Son, he learned obedience from the things which he suffered;</verse>
  <verse number="9">and having been perfected, became to all them that obey him, author of eternal salvation;</verse>
  <verse number="10">addressed by God [as] high priest according to the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Concerning whom we have much to say, and hard to be interpreted in speaking [of it], since ye are become dull in hearing.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have again need that [one] should teach you what [are] the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God, and are become such as have need of milk, [and] not of solid food.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For every one that partakes of milk [is] unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe;</verse>
  <verse number="14">but solid food belongs to full-grown men, who, on account of habit, have their senses exercised for distinguishing both good and evil.</verse>
