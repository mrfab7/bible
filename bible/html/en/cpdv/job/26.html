<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job responded by saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Whose assistant are you? Is he weak-minded? And do you sustain the arm of him that is not strong?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">To whom have you given advice? Perhaps it is to him that has no wisdom or prudence that you have revealed your many ideas.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who is it that you wanted to teach? Was it not him that created the breath of life?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Behold, giant things groan under the waters, and they dwell with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The underworld is naked before him, and there is no covering for perdition.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He stretched out the North over emptiness, and he suspended the land over nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He secures the waters in his clouds, so that they do not burst forth downward all at once.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He holds back the face of his throne, and he stretches his cloud over it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He has set limits around the waters, until light and darkness shall reach their limit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The pillars of heaven tremble and are frightened at his nod.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">By his strength, the seas suddenly gather together, and his foresight has struck the arrogant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">His spirit has adorned the heavens, and his birthing hand has brought forth the winding serpent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Behold, these things have been said about his ways in part, and, since we barely have heard a small drop of his word, who will be able to gaze upon the thunder of his greatness?</p>
