<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Saul was consenting unto his death. And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And devout men buried Stephen, and made great lamentation over him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But Saul laid waste the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They therefore that were scattered abroad went about preaching the word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and proclaimed unto them the Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the multitudes gave heed with one accord unto the things that were spoken by Philip, when they heard, and saw the signs which he did.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For from many of those which had unclean spirits, they came out, crying with a loud voice: and many that were palsied, and that were lame, were healed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And there was much joy in that city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But there was a certain man, Simon by name, which beforetime in the city used sorcery, and amazed the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that power of God which is called Great.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And they gave heed to him, because that of long time he had amazed them with his sorceries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But when they believed Philip preaching good tidings concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Simon also himself believed: and being baptized, he continued with Philip; and beholding signs and great miracles wrought, he was amazed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">for as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they had been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Now when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostlesâ€™ hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But Peter said unto him, Thy silver perish with thee, because thou hast thought to obtain the gift of God with money.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thy heart shall be forgiven thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For I see that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Simon answered and said, Pray ye for me to the Lord, that none of the things which ye have spoken come upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">They therefore, when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But an angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza: the same is desert.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And he arose and went: and behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, who had come to Jerusalem for to worship;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">and he was returning and sitting in his chariot, and was reading the prophet Isaiah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And Philip ran to him, and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And he said, How can I, except some one shall guide me? And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Now the place of the scripture which he was reading was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; And as a lamb before his shearer is dumb, So he openeth not his mouth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: His generation who shall declare? For his life is taken from the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from this scripture, preached unto him Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And as they went on the way, they came unto a certain water; and the eunuch saith, Behold, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37"></p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they both went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more, for he went on his way rejoicing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</p>
