  <verse number="1">And having entered, he was passing through Jericho,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and lo, a man, by name called Zaccheus, and he was a chief tax-gatherer, and he was rich,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and he was seeking to see Jesus, who he is, and was not able for the multitude, because in stature he was small,</verse>
  <verse number="4">and having run forward before, he went up on a sycamore, that he may see him, because through that way he was about to pass by.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And as Jesus came up to the place, having looked up, he saw him, and said unto him, ‘Zaccheus, having hastened, come down, for to-day in thy house it behoveth me to remain;’</verse>
  <verse number="6">and he having hastened did come down, and did receive him rejoicing;</verse>
  <verse number="7">and having seen it, they were all murmuring, saying—‘With a sinful man he went in to lodge!’</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Zaccheus having stood, said unto the Lord, ‘Lo, the half of my goods, sir, I give to the poor, and if of any one anything I did take by false accusation, I give back fourfold.’</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Jesus said unto him—‘To-day salvation did come to this house, inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham;</verse>
  <verse number="10">for the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">And while they are hearing these things, having added he spake a simile, because of his being nigh to Jerusalem, and of their thinking that the reign of God is about presently to be made manifest.</verse>
  <verse number="12">He said therefore, ‘A certain man of birth went on to a far country, to take to himself a kingdom, and to return,</verse>
  <verse number="13">and having called ten servants of his own, he gave to them ten pounds, and said unto them, Do business—till I come;</verse>
  <verse number="14">and his citizens were hating him, and did send an embassy after him, saying, We do not wish this one to reign over us.</verse>
  <verse number="15">‘And it came to pass, on his coming back, having taken the kingdom, that he commanded these servants to be called to him, to whom he gave the money, that he might know what any one had done in business.</verse>
  <verse number="16">‘And the first came near, saying, Sir, thy pound did gain ten pounds;</verse>
  <verse number="17">and he said to him, Well done, good servant, because in a very little thou didst become faithful, be having authority over ten cities.</verse>
  <verse number="18">‘And the second came, saying, Sir, thy pound made five pounds;</verse>
  <verse number="19">and he said also to this one, And thou, become thou over five cities.</verse>
  <verse number="20">‘And another came, saying, Sir, lo, thy pound, that I had lying away in a napkin;</verse>
  <verse number="21">for I was afraid of thee, because thou art an austere man; thou takest up what thou didst not lay down, and reapest what thou didst not sow.</verse>
  <verse number="22">‘And he saith to him, Out of thy mouth I will judge thee, evil servant: thou knewest that I am an austere man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow!</verse>
  <verse number="23">and wherefore didst thou not give my money to the bank, and I, having come, with interest might have received it?</verse>
  <verse number="24">‘And to those standing by he said, Take from him the pound, and give to him having the ten pounds—</verse>
  <verse number="25">(and they said to him, Sir, he hath ten pounds)—</verse>
  <verse number="26">for I say to you, that to every one having shall be given, and from him not having, also what he hath shall be taken from him,</verse>
  <verse number="27">but those my enemies, who did not wish me to reign over them, bring hither and slay before me.’</verse>
  <verse number="28">And having said these things, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And it came to pass, as he came nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, unto the mount called of the Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</verse>
  <verse number="30">having said, Go away to the village over-against, in which, entering into, ye shall find a colt bound, on which no one of men did ever sit, having loosed it, bring it;</verse>
  <verse number="31">and if any one doth question you, Wherefore do ye loose it? thus ye shall say to him—The Lord hath need of it.’</verse>
  <verse number="32">And those sent, having gone away, found according as he said to them,</verse>
  <verse number="33">and while they are loosing the colt, its owners said unto them, ‘Why loose ye the colt?’</verse>
  <verse number="34">and they said, ‘The Lord hath need of it;’</verse>
  <verse number="35">and they brought it unto Jesus, and having cast their garments upon the colt, they did set Jesus upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And as he is going, they were spreading their garments in the way,</verse>
  <verse number="37">and as he is coming nigh now, at the descent of the mount of the Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began rejoicing to praise God with a great voice for all the mighty works they had seen,</verse>
  <verse number="38">saying, ‘blessed is he who is coming, a king in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.’</verse>
  <verse number="39">And certain of the Pharisees from the multitude said unto him, ‘Teacher, rebuke thy disciples;’</verse>
  <verse number="40">and he answering said to them, ‘I say to you, that, if these shall be silent, the stones will cry out!’</verse>
  <verse number="41">And when he came nigh, having seen the city, he wept over it,</verse>
  <verse number="42">saying—‘If thou didst know, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things for thy peace; but now they were hid from thine eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="43">‘Because days shall come upon thee, and thine enemies shall cast around thee a rampart, and compass thee round, and press thee on every side,</verse>
  <verse number="44">and lay thee low, and thy children within thee, and they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone, because thou didst not know the time of thy inspection.’</verse>
  <verse number="45">And having entered into the temple, he began to cast forth those selling in it, and those buying,</verse>
  <verse number="46">saying to them, ‘It hath been written, My house is a house of prayer—but ye made it a den of robbers.’</verse>
  <verse number="47">And he was teaching daily in the temple, but the chief priests and the scribes were seeking to destroy him—also the chiefs of the people—</verse>
  <verse number="48">and they were not finding what they shall do, for all the people were hanging on him, hearing him.</verse>
