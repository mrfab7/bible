<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="39" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? Or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? Or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They bow themselves, they bring forth their young, They cast out their pains.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Their young ones become strong, they grow up in the open field; They go forth, and return not again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who hath sent out the wild ass free? Or who hath loosed the bonds of the swift ass,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Whose home I have made the wilderness, And the salt land his dwelling-place?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He scorneth the tumult of the city, Neither heareth he the shoutings of the driver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The range of the mountains is his pasture, And he searcheth after every green thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Will the wild-ox be content to serve thee? Or will he abide by thy crib?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Canst thou bind the wild-ox with his band in the furrow? Or will he harrow the valleys after thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? Or wilt thou leave to him thy labor?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Wilt thou confide in him, that he will bring home thy seed, And gather the grain of thy threshing-floor?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The wings of the ostrich wave proudly; But are they the pinions and plumage of love?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For she leaveth her eggs on the earth, And warmeth them in the dust,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, Or that the wild beast may trample them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">She dealeth hardly with her young ones, as if they were not hers: Though her labor be in vain, she is without fear;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, Neither hath he imparted to her understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">What time she lifteth up herself on high, She scorneth the horse and his rider.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Hast thou given the horse his might? Hast thou clothed his neck with the quivering mane?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Hast thou made him to leap as a locust? The glory of his snorting is terrible.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: He goeth out to meet the armed men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He mocketh at fear, and is not dismayed; Neither turneth he back from the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The quiver rattleth against him, The flashing spear and the javelin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage; Neither believeth he that it is the voice of the trumpet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">As oft as the trumpet soundeth he saith, Aha! And he smelleth the battle afar off, The thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Is it by thy wisdom that the hawk soareth, And stretcheth her wings toward the south?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Is it at thy command that the eagle mounteth up, And maketh her nest on high?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">On the cliff she dwelleth, and maketh her home, Upon the point of the cliff, and the stronghold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">From thence she spieth out the prey; Her eyes behold it afar off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Her young ones also suck up blood: And where the slain are, there is she.</p>
