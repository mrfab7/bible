1	And the Spirit says expressly, that in later times some shall be removed from the faith, holding to deceitful spirits, and doctrines of evil spirits;
2	In the hypocrisy of speaking falsely; burned with a hot iron in their own consciousness;
3	Hindering to marry, to keep from victuals which God created for participation, with thanks, for the faithful and them knowing the truth.
4	For every created thing of God good, and nothing thrown away, received with thanks:
5	For it is consecrated by the word of God and entreaty.
6	These having laid down to the brethren, thou shalt be a good servant of Jesus Christ, brought up in the words of faith and good doctrine, which thou hast closely followed.
7	And profane and old womenâ€™s fictions reject, and exercise thyself in devotion.
8	For bodily exercise is profitable, to little: but devotion is profitable to all things, having promise of life now, and that about to be.
9	Faithful the word, and worthy of all acceptance.
10	For, for this also we are wearied and reproached, that we have hoped in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, chiefly of the faithful.
11	Proclaim and teach these things.
12	Let none despise thy youth; but be thou a type of the faithful, in word, in intercourse, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
13	Till I come, hold to reading loud, to entreaty, to doctrine.
14	Neglect not the power which in thee, which was given thee by the gift of prophecy, with the putting on of hands of the council of elders.
15	Bestow diligent care upon these things; be in them; that thy progress may be manifest in all things.
16	Take heed to thyself, and to the doctrine; remain in them: for doing this, and thou shalt save thyself, and them hearing thee.
