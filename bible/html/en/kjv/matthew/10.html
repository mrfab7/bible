<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And when he had called unto [him] his twelve disciples, he gave them power [against] unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James [the son] of Zebedee, and John his brother;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James [the son] of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into [any] city of the Samaritans enter ye not:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Nor scrip for [your] journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And when ye come into an house, salute it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against [their] parents, and cause them to be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And ye shall be hated of all [men] for my name’s sake: but he that endureth to the end shall be saved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The disciple is not above [his] master, nor the servant above his lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more [shall they call] them of his household?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">What I tell you in darkness, [that] speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, [that] preach ye upon the housetops.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father which is in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her mother in law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And a man’s foes [shall be] they of his own household.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold [water] only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.</p>
