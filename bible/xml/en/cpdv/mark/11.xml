  <verse number="1">And as they were approaching Jerusalem and Bethania, toward the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and he said to them: “Go into the village that is opposite you, and immediately upon entering there, you will find a colt tied, on which no man has yet sat. Release him and bring him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And if anyone will say to you: ‘What are you doing?’ Say that the Lord has need of him. And he will immediately send him here.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">And going out, they found the colt tied before the outer gate, at the meeting of two ways. And they untied him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And some of those who were standing there said to them, “What are you doing by releasing the colt?”</verse>
  <verse number="6">And they spoke to them just as Jesus had instructed them. And they permitted them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they led the colt to Jesus. And they placed their garments on it; and he sat upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then many spread their garments along the way; but others cut down leafy branches from trees and scattered them on the way.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And those who went ahead, and those who followed, cried out saying: “Hosanna! Blessed is he who has arrived in the name of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Blessed is the advent of the kingdom of our father David. Hosanna in the highest!”</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple. And having looked around at everything, since it was now the evening hour, he went out to Bethania with the twelve.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the next day, as they were departing from Bethania, he was hungry.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And when he had seen a fig tree with leaves in the distance, he went to it, in case he might find something on it. And when he had gone to it, he found nothing but leaves. For it was not the season for figs.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And in response, he said to it, “From now on and forever, may no one eat fruit from you again!” And his disciples heard this.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And they went to Jerusalem. And when he had entered into the temple, he began to cast out the sellers and the buyers in the temple. And he overturned the tables of the moneychangers and the chairs of the vendors of doves.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he would not permit anyone to carry goods through the temple.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he taught them, saying: “Is it not written: ‘For my house shall be called the house of prayer for all nations?’ But you have made it into a den of robbers.”</verse>
  <verse number="18">And when the leaders of the priests, and the scribes, had heard this, they sought a means by which they might destroy him. For they feared him, because the entire multitude was in admiration over his doctrine.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And when evening had arrived, he departed from the city.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And when they passed by in the morning, they saw that the fig tree had dried up from the roots.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Peter, remembering, said to him, “Master, behold, the fig tree that you cursed has withered.”</verse>
  <verse number="22">And in response, Jesus said to them: “Have the faith of God.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Amen I say to you, that whoever will say to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and cast into the sea,’ and who will not have hesitated in his heart, but will have believed: then whatever he has said be done, it shall be done for him.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For this reason, I say to you, all things whatsoever that you ask for when praying: believe that you will receive them, and they will happen for you.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And when you stand to pray, if you hold anything against anyone, forgive them, so that your Father, who is in heaven, may also forgive you your sins.</verse>
  <verse number="26">But if you will not forgive, neither will your Father, who is in heaven, forgive you your sins.”</verse>
  <verse number="27">And they went again to Jerusalem. And when he was walking in the temple, the leaders of the priests, and the scribes, and the elders approached him.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And they said to him: “By what authority do you do these things? And who has given you this authority, so that you would do these things?”</verse>
  <verse number="29">But in response, Jesus said to them: “I also will ask you one word, and if you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
  <verse number="30">The baptism of John: was it from heaven or from men? Answer me.”</verse>
  <verse number="31">But they discussed it among themselves, saying: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Then why did you not believe him?’</verse>
  <verse number="32">If we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the people. For they all hold that John was a true prophet.”</verse>
  <verse number="33">And answering, they said to Jesus, “We do not know.” And in response, Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”</verse>
