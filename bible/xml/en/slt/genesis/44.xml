  <verse number="1">And he will command him over house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they shall be able to lift up, and put the silver of each in the mouth of his sack.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And my cup, the silver cup, thou shalt put in the sack’s mouth of the small one, and the silver of his grain; and he will do according to the word which Joseph spake.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The morning shone, and the men were sent away, they and their asses.</verse>
  <verse number="4">They came forth out of the city, they were not far off, and Joseph said to him over his house, Arise, pursue after the men, and having overtaken them, and say to them, For what did ye requite evil for good?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Is it not this which my lord will drink in it, and divining he will divine in it? ye were evil in which ye did.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he will overtake them, and will speak to them these words.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they will say to him, For what will my lord speak according to these words? far be it for thy servants to do according to this word.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Behold, the silver which we found in the mouth of our sacks, we turned back to thee from the land of Canaan: and how shall we steal from thy lord’s house, silver or gold?</verse>
  <verse number="9">With whomsoever of thy servants it shall be found, and he shall die, and also we will be for servants to my lord.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And he will say, Also now according to your words let it be thus: with whomsoever it shall be found, he shall be servant to me, and ye shall be pure.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And they will hasten, and will take down each his sack to the earth, and they will open each his sack.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he will search, beginning at the great and finishing at the small: and he will find the cup in Benjamin’s sack.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And they will rend their garments, and will lift up each upon his ass, and will turn back to the city.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Judah and his brethren will come to Joseph’s house, and he yet there: and they will fall before him to the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Joseph will say to them, What this deed ye did? knew ye not that divining, a man shall divine such as I?</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Judah will say to him, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak? and how shall we be justified? God found the iniquity of thy servants: behold we are servants to my lord, also we, also him the cup being found in his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he will say, Far be it for me to do this: the man in whose band the cup being found, he shall be servant to me; and ye, go ye up in peace to your father.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Judah will come near to him and will say, With leave my lord, now shall thy servant speak a word in the ear of my lord, and thine anger shall not be kindled against thy servant; for with thee as Pharaoh.</verse>
  <verse number="19">My lord didst ask thy servants, saying, Is there a father to you, or a brother?</verse>
  <verse number="20">And we said to my lord, There is a father to us, an old man, and a child of old age, a little one: and his brother died, and he will be left alone to his mother; and his father loved him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And thou wilt say to thy servants, Bring him down to me, and I shall set mine eyes upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And we shall say to my lord, The youth will not be able to leave his father; and did he leave his father, he died.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And thou wilt say to thy servants, If your little brother shall not come down with you, ye shall not add to see my face.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And it shall be when we went up to thy servant our father, and announced to him the words of, my lord.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And our father will say, Turn back and buy for us a little food.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And we shall say, We shall not be able to go down: if our little brother is with us, and we will go down; for we shall not be able to see the man’s face, and our little brother not with us.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And thy servant my father will say to us, Ye knew that my wife brought forth to me two.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the one went forth from me and it was said, Surely he was torn in pieces, he was torn in pieces; and I saw him not till now.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And took ye this also from my face, and harm befell him, and ye brought down my old age with evil to hades.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And now if I came to thy servant my father, and the youth not with us, for his soul is bound upon his soul,</verse>
  <verse number="31">And it was when he having seen that the youth is not, and he will die: and thy servants brought down the old age of thy servant our father in grief to hades.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For thy servant became surety for the youth with my father, saying, If I shall not bring him to thee, I sinned against my father all the days.</verse>
  <verse number="33">At this time thy servant shall now remain for the youth, a servant to my lord; and the youth shall go up with his brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For how shall I go up to my father and the youth not with me? lest I shall look upon the evil which shall find my father.</verse>
