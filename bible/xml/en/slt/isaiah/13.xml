  <verse number="4">The voice of a multitude in the mountain; the likeness of much people; the voice of the uproar of kingdoms, nations being gathered: Jehovah of armies reviewing the army of battle.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Coming from a land from afar, from the extremity of the heavens, Jehovah and the vessels of his wrath to overthrow all the earth.</verse>

  <verse number="11">And I appointed evil over the habitable globe, and upon the unjust their iniquity; and I caused to cease the pride of the arrogant, and I will humble the pride of the terrible.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I will make a man precious above pure gold, and a man above the gold of Ophir.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For this I will provoke the heavens to anger, and the earth shall tremble from her place, in the wrath of Jehovah of armies, and in the day of his burning anger.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And it was as the roe being thrust down and as a sheep and not a man gathering: to his people shall they turn, and they shall flee a man to his land.</verse>
  <verse number="15">All being found shall be thrust through; and every one scraped together shall fall by the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And their children shall be dashed in pieces before their eyes, and their houses shall be plundered, and their wives shall be ravished.</verse>

  <verse number="18">And the bows of the boys shall be dashed in pieces, and the fruit of the womb they shall not pity; and upon their sons their eye shall not have compassion.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Babel the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees’ grandeur was as God overthrowing Sodom and Gomorrah.</verse>
  <verse number="20">It shall not be inhabited forever, and it shall not be dwelt in even to generation and generation: and the Arabian shall not go on there, and the shepherds shall not recline there.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And inhabitants of the desert reclined there, and their houses were filled with howlings, and the daughters of the ostrich dwelt there, and he goats shall leap there.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And howlers cried out in its palaces, and great serpents in the temples of delight: and her time draws near to come, and her days shall not be protracted.</verse>
