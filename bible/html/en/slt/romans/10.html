<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Brethren, truly my heartâ€™s delight and prayer to God for Israel is for salvation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For I testify for them that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For not knowing the justice of God, and seeking to establish their own justice, they have not been subjected to the justice of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For Christ the end of the law for justice to every one believing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For Moses writes the justice of the law, That the man having done these things shall live in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the justice of faith says thus, Thou shouldest not say in thy heart, Who shall go up to heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down:)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Or, Who shall go down to the abyss? (that is, to bring up Christ from the dead.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But what does it say? The word is near thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we proclaim;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For if thou confess in thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For with the heart is believed for justice: and with the mouth is confessed for salvation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the writing says, Every one believing upon him shall not be ashamed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For no distinction is of the Jew and also of the Greek: for the same Lord of all being rich to all calling upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For every one whoever should call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">How then shall they call upon whom they believed not? and how shall they believe whom they heard not? and how shall they hear without him proclaiming?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And how shall they proclaim, except they be sent? as has been written, How beautiful the feet of them announcing good news, peace, of them announcing good things!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But not all listened to the good news. For Esaias says, Lord, who believed our report?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Therefore faith, from the report, and report by the word of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But I say, Have they not heard? Surely, in all the earth went out their sound, and their words to the end of the habitable globe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses says, I will make you jealous of not a nation, and by a shortsighted nation will I anger you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Esaias is very confident, and says, I was found of them not seeking me; I was manifested to them not asking for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And to Israel he says, The whole day have I unfolded my hands to an unbelieving and contradicting people.</p>
