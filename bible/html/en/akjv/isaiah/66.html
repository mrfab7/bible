<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Thus said the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that you build to me? and where is the place of my rest?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For all those things has my hand made, and all those things have been, said the LORD: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembles at my word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He that kills an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrifices a lamb, as if he cut off a dog’s neck; he that offers an oblation, as if he offered swine’s blood; he that burns incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yes, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears on them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke, they did not hear: but they did evil before my eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Hear the word of the LORD, you that tremble at his word; Your brothers that hated you, that cast you out for my name’s sake, said, Let the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall be ashamed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the LORD that renders recompense to his enemies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Who has heard such a thing? who has seen such things? Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? said the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? said your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Rejoice you with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all you that love her: rejoice for joy with her, all you that mourn for her:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">That you may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that you may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For thus said the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then shall you suck, you shall be borne on her sides, and be dandled on her knees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you; and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And when you see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the gardens behind one tree in the middle, eating swine’s flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, said the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And they shall bring all your brothers for an offering to the LORD out of all nations on horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and on swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, said the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, said the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, said the LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before me, said the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And they shall go forth, and look on the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring to all flesh.</p>
