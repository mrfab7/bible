  <verse number="1">Abram went up out of Egypt: he, his wife, all that he had, and Lot with him, into the South.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.</verse>
  <verse number="3">He went on his journeys from the South even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai,</verse>
  <verse number="4">to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first. There Abram called on the name of Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together: for their substance was great, so that they could not live together.</verse>
  <verse number="7">There was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite lived in the land at that time.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Abram said to Lot, “Please, let there be no strife between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we are relatives.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Isn’t the whole land before you? Please separate yourself from me. If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right. Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left.”</verse>
  <verse number="10">Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan, that it was well-watered everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.</verse>
  <verse number="11">So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself. Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves the one from the other.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners against Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Yahweh said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, “Now, lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are, northward and southward and eastward and westward,</verse>
  <verse number="15">for all the land which you see, I will give to you, and to your offspring forever.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then your seed may also be numbered.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Arise, walk through the land in its length and in its breadth; for I will give it to you.”</verse>
  <verse number="18">Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre, which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Yahweh.</verse>
