<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Then said I: ‘Whither goest thou?’ And he said unto me: ‘To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And, behold, the angel that spoke with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and said unto him: ‘Run, speak to this young man, saying: ‘Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Ho, ho, flee then from the land of the north, saith the LORD; for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Ho, Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For thus saith the LORD of hosts who sent me after glory unto the nations which spoiled you: ‘Surely, he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For, behold, I will shake My hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them’; and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion; for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And many nations shall join themselves to the LORD in that day, and shall be My people, and I will dwell in the midst of thee’; and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the LORD shall inherit Judah as His portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD; for He is aroused out of His holy habitation.</p>
