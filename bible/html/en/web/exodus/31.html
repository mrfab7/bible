<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Behold, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all kinds of workmanship,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">to devise skillful works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood, to work in all kinds of workmanship.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make all that I have commanded you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the testimony, the mercy seat that is on it, all the furniture of the Tent,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">the table and its vessels, the pure lampstand with all its vessels, the altar of incense,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, the basin and its base,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">the finely worked garments—the holy garments for Aaron the priest—the garments of his sons to minister in the priest’s office,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for the holy place: according to all that I have commanded you they shall do.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">“Speak also to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Most certainly you shall keep my Sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">You shall keep the Sabbath therefore; for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath of solemn rest, holy to Yahweh. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations, for a perpetual covenant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed.’”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He gave to Moses, when he finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony, stone tablets, written with God’s finger.</p>
