  <verse number="1">Be not many of you teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive heavier judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For in many things we all stumble. If any stumbleth not in word, the same is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body also.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Now if we put the horses’ bridles into their mouths that they may obey us, we turn about their whole body also.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Behold, the ships also, though they are so great and are driven by rough winds, are yet turned about by a very small rudder, whither the impulse of the steersman willeth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">So the tongue also is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how much wood is kindled by how small a fire!</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the tongue is a fire: the world of iniquity among our members is the tongue, which defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the wheel of nature, and is set on fire by hell.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For every kind of beasts and birds, of creeping things and things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind:</verse>
  <verse number="8">but the tongue can no man tame; it is a restless evil, it is full of deadly poison.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Therewith bless we the Lord and Father; and therewith curse we men, who are made after the likeness of God:</verse>
  <verse number="10">out of the same mouth cometh forth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Doth the fountain send forth from the same opening sweet water and bitter?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Can a fig tree, my brethren, yield olives, or a vine figs? neither can salt water yield sweet.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who is wise and understanding among you? let him show by his good life his works in meekness of wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But if ye have bitter jealousy and faction in your heart, glory not and lie not against the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">This wisdom is not a wisdom that cometh down from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For where jealousy and faction are, there is confusion and every vile deed.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without variance, without hypocrisy.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace for them that make peace.</verse>
