<div class="chapter" data-book="Hosea" data-chapter="9" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Don’t rejoice, Israel, to jubilation like the nations; for you were unfaithful to your God. You love the wages of a prostitute at every grain threshing floor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The threshing floor and the winepress won’t feed them, and the new wine will fail her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They won’t dwell in Yahweh’s land; but Ephraim will return to Egypt, and they will eat unclean food in Assyria.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They won’t pour out wine offerings to Yahweh, neither will they be pleasing to him. Their sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners; all who eat of it will be polluted; for their bread will be for their appetite. It will not come into the house of Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">What will you do in the day of solemn assembly, and in the day of the feast of Yahweh?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For, behold, they have gone away from destruction. Egypt will gather them up. Memphis will bury them. Nettles will possess their pleasant things of silver. Thorns will be in their tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The days of visitation have come. The days of reckoning have come. Israel will consider the prophet to be a fool, and the man who is inspired to be insane, because of the abundance of your sins, and because your hostility is great.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">A prophet watches over Ephraim with my God. A fowler’s snare is on all of his paths, and hostility in the house of his God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah. He will remember their iniquity. He will punish them for their sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness. I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at its first season; but they came to Baal Peor, and consecrated themselves to the shameful thing, and became abominable like that which they loved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird. There will be no birth, none with child, and no conception.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Though they bring up their children, yet I will bereave them, so that not a man shall be left. Indeed, woe also to them when I depart from them!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a pleasant place; but Ephraim will bring out his children to the murderer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Give them—Yahweh what will you give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">“All their wickedness is in Gilgal; for there I hated them. Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of my house! I will love them no more. All their princes are rebels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Ephraim is struck. Their root has dried up. They will bear no fruit. Even though they bring forth, yet I will kill the beloved ones of their womb.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">My God will cast them away, because they did not listen to him; and they will be wanderers among the nations.</p>
