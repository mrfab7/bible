<chapter book="2 Timothy" number="3" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But know this, that in the last days grievous times shall come.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, haughty, railers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</verse>
  <verse number="3">without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,</verse>
  <verse number="4">traitors, headstrong, puffed up, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;</verse>
  <verse number="5">holding a form of godliness, but having denied the power thereof: from these also turn away.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For of these are they that creep into houses, and take captive silly women laden with sins, led away by divers lusts,</verse>
  <verse number="7">ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And like as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also withstand the truth; men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be evident unto all men, as theirs also came to be.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But thou didst follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,</verse>
  <verse number="11">persecutions, sufferings; what things befell me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: and out of them all the Lord delivered me.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Yea, and all that would live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But evil men and impostors shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But abide thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;</verse>
  <verse number="15">and that from a babe thou hast known the sacred writings which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Every scripture inspired of God is also profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction which is in righteousness:</verse>
  <verse number="17">that the man of God may be complete, furnished completely unto every good work.</verse>
