<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="6" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Know you not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If then you have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brothers?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But brother goes to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because you go to law one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">No, you do wrong, and defraud, and that your brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortionists, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And such were some of you: but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And God has both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">What? know you not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, said he, shall be one flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Flee fornication. Every sin that a man does is without the body; but he that commits fornication sins against his own body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">What? know you not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which you have of God, and you are not your own?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are Godâ€™s.</p>
