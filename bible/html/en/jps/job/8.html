<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How long wilt thou speak these things, Seeing that the words of thy mouth are as a mighty wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Doth God pervert judgment? Or doth the Almighty pervert justice?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If thy children sinned against Him, He delivered them into the hand of their transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If thou wouldest seek earnestly unto God, And make thy supplication to the Almighty;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If thou wert pure and upright; Surely now He would awake for thee, And make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And though thy beginning was small, Yet thy end should greatly increase.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For inquire, I pray thee, of the former generation, And apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, Because our days upon earth are a shadow—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, And utter words out of their heart?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Can the rush shoot up without mire? Can the reed-grass grow without water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Whilst it is yet in its greenness, and not cut down, It withereth before any other herb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">So are the paths of all that forget God; And the hope of the godless man shall perish;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Whose confidence is gossamer, And whose trust is a spider’s web.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand; He shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He is green before the sun, And his shoots go forth over his garden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">His roots are wrapped about the heap, He beholdeth the place of stones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If he be destroyed from his place, Then it shall deny him: ‘I have not seen thee.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Behold, this is the joy of his way, And out of the earth shall others spring.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Behold, God will not cast away an innocent man, Neither will He uphold the evil-doers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Till He fill thy mouth with laughter, And thy lips with shouting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; And the tent of the wicked shall be no more.</p>
