<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After these things hath the word of Jehovah been unto Abram in a vision, saying, ‘Fear not, Abram, I am a shield to thee, thy reward is exceeding great.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Abram saith, ‘Lord Jehovah, what dost Thou give to me, and I am going childless? and an acquired son in my house is Demmesek Eliezer.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Abram saith, ‘Lo, to me Thou hast not given seed, and lo, a domestic doth heir me.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And lo, the word of Jehovah is unto him, saying, ‘This one doth not heir thee; but he who cometh out from thy bowels, he doth heir thee;’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and He bringeth him out without, and saith, ‘Look attentively, I pray thee, towards the heavens, and count the stars, if thou art able to count them;’ and He saith to him, ‘Thus is thy seed.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he hath believed in Jehovah, and He reckoneth it to him—righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And He saith unto him, ‘I am Jehovah who brought thee out from Ur of the Chaldees, to give to thee this land to possess it;’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">and he saith, ‘Lord Jehovah, whereby do I know that I possess it?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And He saith unto him, ‘Take for Me a heifer of three years, and a she-goat of three years, and a ram of three years, and a turtle-dove, and a young bird;’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and he taketh to him all these, and separateth them in the midst, and putteth each piece over against its fellow, but the bird he hath not divided;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and the ravenous birds come down upon the carcases, and Abram causeth them to turn back.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the sun is about to go in, and deep sleep hath fallen upon Abram, and lo, a terror of great darkness is falling upon him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and He saith to Abram, ‘knowing—know that thy seed is a sojourner in a land not theirs, and they have served them, and they have afflicted them four hundred years,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and the nation also whom they serve I judge, and after this they go out with great substance;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and thou—thou comest in unto thy fathers in peace; thou art buried in a good old age;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">and the fourth generation doth turn back hither, for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And it cometh to pass—the sun hath gone in, and thick darkness hath been—and lo, a furnace of smoke, and a lamp of fire, which hath passed over between those pieces.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">In that day hath Jehovah made with Abram a covenant, saying, ‘To thy seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Phrat,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">with the Kenite, and the Kenizzite, and the Kadmonite,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Rephaim,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Girgashite, and the Jebusite.’</p>
