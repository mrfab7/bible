<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do righteousness: for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that holdeth fast by it; that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Neither let the stranger, that hath joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD will surely separate me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For thus saith the LORD of the eunuchs that keep my sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and hold fast by my covenant:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a memorial and a name better than of sons and of daughters; I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Also the strangers, that join themselves to the LORD, to minister unto him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it, and holdeth fast by my covenant;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar: for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all peoples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The Lord GOD which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith, Yet will I gather others to him, beside his own that are gathered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts in the forest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">His watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge; they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; dreaming, lying down, loving to slumber.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Yea, the dogs are greedy, they can never have enough; and these are shepherds that cannot understand: they have all turned to their own way, each one to his gain, from every quarter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow shall be as this day, a day great beyond measure.</p>
