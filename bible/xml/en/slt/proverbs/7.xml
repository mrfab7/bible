  <verse number="1">My son, watch my words, and thou shalt hide my commands with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Watch my commands, and live; and my law as the pupil of thine eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Bind them upon thy fingers, and write them upon the tablet of thine heart.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Say to wisdom, Thou my sister; and thou shalt call knowledge to understanding:</verse>
  <verse number="5">To watch thyself from the strange woman, from the stranger making smooth her sayings.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For in the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice,</verse>
  <verse number="7">And I shall see among the simple, I shall perceive among the sons a youth wanting heart,</verse>
  <verse number="8">Passing in the street near her corner; and he will step the way of her house,</verse>
  <verse number="9">In the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the middle of the night, in the thick darkness:</verse>
  <verse number="10">And behold, a woman to his meeting, the attire of a harlot, and hidden of heart.</verse>
  <verse number="11">She being noisy and perverse; her feet will not dwell in her house:</verse>
  <verse number="12">One time without, one time in the broad ways; and she will lie in wait near every corner.</verse>
  <verse number="13">She laid hold upon him and kissed to him; she strengthened her face, and she will say to him,</verse>
  <verse number="14">Sacrifices of peace upon me: today I repaid my vows.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For this, I shall come forth to thy meeting, to seek thy face, and I shall find thee.</verse>
  <verse number="16">With adornings I spread my bed, variegated with thread of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I sprinkled my bed with myrrh and aloes and cinnamon.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Come, we will be satisfied with loves till the morning: we will rejoice ourselves with loves.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For the man not in the house, he went in a way far off.</verse>
  <verse number="20">He took a bundle of silver in his hand; he will come to his house the day of the full moon.</verse>
  <verse number="21">With much of her talking she caused him to turn aside; with the smoothness of her lips she will thrust him away.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He went after her suddenly as the ox will go to the slaughter, and as the fetter for the correction of the foolish.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Till an arrow shall cleave his liver; as a bird hastening to the snare, and not knowing that it is for his soul.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And now, ye sons, hear to me, and attend to the sayings of my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And thy heart shall not deviate to her ways; thou shalt not wander in her beaten paths.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For she cast down many wounded, and the strong all being slain by her.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Her house the ways to hades, going down to the chambers of death.</verse>
