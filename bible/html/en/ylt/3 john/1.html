<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The Elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">beloved, concerning all things I desire thee to prosper, and to be in health, even as thy soul doth prosper,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">for I rejoiced exceedingly, brethren coming and testifying of the truth in thee, even as thou in truth dost walk;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">greater than these things I have no joy, that I may hear of my children in truth walking.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Beloved, faithfully dost thou do whatever thou mayest work to the brethren and to the strangers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">who did testify of thy love before an assembly, whom thou wilt do well, having sent forward worthily of God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">because for His name they went forth, nothing receiving from the nations;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">we, then, ought to receive such, that fellow-workers we may become to the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I did write to the assembly, but he who is loving the first place among them—Diotrephes—doth not receive us;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">because of this, if I may come, I will cause him to remember his works that he doth, with evil words prating against us; and not content with these, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and those intending he doth forbid, and out of the assembly he doth cast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Beloved, be not thou following that which is evil, but that which is good; he who is doing good, of God he is, and he who is doing evil hath not seen God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">to Demetrius testimony hath been given by all, and by the truth itself, and we also—we do testify, and ye have known that our testimony is true.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Many things I had to write, but I do not wish through ink and pen to write to thee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and I hope straightway to see thee, and mouth to mouth we shall speak. Peace to thee! salute thee do the friends; be saluting the friends by name.</p>
