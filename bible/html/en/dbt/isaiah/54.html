<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Exult, thou barren, that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and shout for joy, thou that didst not travail with child: for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married wife, saith Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For thou shalt spread abroad on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall possess nations, and they shall make desolate cities to be inhabited.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Fear not, for thou shalt not be ashamed; neither be thou confounded, for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For thy Maker is thy husband: Jehovah of hosts is his name, and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: the God of the whole earth shall he be called.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For Jehovah hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit, and as a wife of youth, that hath been refused, saith thy God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">In the outpouring of wrath have I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with everlasting loving-kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For this is [as] the waters of Noah unto me, since I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth: so have I sworn that I will no more be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my loving-kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall my covenant of peace be removed, saith Jehovah, that hath mercy on thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">[Thou] afflicted, tossed with tempest, not comforted! Behold, I will set thy stones in antimony, and lay thy foundations with sapphires;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">and I will make thy battlements of rubies, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of precious stones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And all thy children [shall be] taught of Jehovah, and great shall be the peace of thy children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far from oppression, for thou shalt not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold, they shall surely gather together, [but] not by me: whosoever gathereth together against thee shall fall because of thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Behold, it is I who have created the smith that bloweth in the fire of coal, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and I have created the destroyer to ravage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">No weapon that is prepared against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that riseth against thee in judgment, thou shalt condemn. This is the inheritance of the servants of Jehovah; and their righteousness is of me, saith Jehovah.</p>
