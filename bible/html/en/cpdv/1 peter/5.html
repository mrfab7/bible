<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Peter" data-chapter="5" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Therefore, I beg the elders who are among you, as one who is also an elder and a witness of the Passion of Christ, who also shares in that glory which is to be revealed in the future:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">pasture the flock of God that is among you, providing for it, not as a requirement, but willingly, in accord with God, and not for the sake of tainted profit, but freely,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">not so as to dominate by means of the clerical state, but so as to be formed into a flock from the heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And when the Leader of pastors will have appeared, you shall secure an unfading crown of glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Similarly, young persons, be subject to the elders. And infuse all humility among one another, for God resists the arrogant, but to the humble he gives grace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And so, be humbled under the powerful hand of God, so that he may exalt you in the time of visitation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Cast all your cares upon him, for he takes care of you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Be sober and vigilant. For your adversary, the devil, is like a roaring lion, traveling around and seeking those whom he might devour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Resist him by being strong in faith, being aware that the same passions afflict those who are your brothers in the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But the God of all grace, who has called us to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, will himself perfect, confirm, and establish us, after a brief time of suffering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I have written briefly, through Sylvanus, whom I consider to be a faithful brother to you, begging and testifying that this is the true grace of God, in which you have been established.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The Church which is in Babylon, elect together with you, greets you, as does my son, Mark.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Greet one another with a holy kiss. Grace be to all of you who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
