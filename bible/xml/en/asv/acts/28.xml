  <verse number="1">And when we were escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the barbarians showed us no common kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out by reason of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And when the barbarians saw the venomous creature hanging from his hand, they said one to another, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped from the sea, yet Justice hath not suffered to live.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Howbeit he shook off the creature into the fire, and took no harm.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But they expected that he would have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but when they were long in expectation and beheld nothing amiss came to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us, and entertained us three days courteously.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it was so, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery: unto whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laying his hands on him healed him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And when this was done, the rest also that had diseases in the island came, and were cured:</verse>
  <verse number="10">who also honored us with many honors; and when we sailed, they put on board such things as we needed.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And after three months we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had wintered in the island, whose sign was The Twin Brothers.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And touching at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And from thence we made a circuit, and arrived at Rhegium: and after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli;</verse>
  <verse number="14">where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days: and so we came to Rome.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And from thence the brethren, when they heard of us, came to meet us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns; whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And when we entered into Rome, Paul was suffered to abide by himself with the soldier that guarded him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And it came to pass, that after three days he called together those that were the chief of the Jews: and when they were come together, he said unto them, I, brethren, though I had done nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans:</verse>
  <verse number="18">who, when they had examined me, desired to set me at liberty, because there was no cause of death in me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Cæsar; not that I had aught whereof to accuse my nation.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For this cause therefore did I entreat you to see and to speak with me: for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they said unto him, We neither received letters from Judæa concerning thee, nor did any of the brethren come hither and report or speak any harm of thee.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And when they had appointed him a day, they came to him into his lodging in great number; to whom he expounded the matter, testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses and from the prophets, from morning till evening.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet unto your fathers,</verse>
  <verse number="26">saying, Go thou unto this people, and say, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall in no wise understand; And seeing ye shall see, and shall in no wise perceive:</verse>
  <verse number="27">For this people’s heart is waxed gross, And their ears are dull of hearing, And their eyes they have closed; Lest, haply they should perceive with their eyes, And hear with their ears, And understand with their heart, And should turn again, And I should heal them.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Be it known therefore unto you, that this salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles: they will also hear.</verse>
  <verse number="29"></verse>
  <verse number="30">And he abode two whole years in his own hired dwelling, and received all that went in unto him,</verse>
  <verse number="31">preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, none forbidding him.</verse>
