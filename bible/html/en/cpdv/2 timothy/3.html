<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And know this: that in the last days perilous times will press near.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Men will be lovers of themselves, greedy, self-exalting, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, wicked,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">without affection, without peace, false accusers, unchaste, cruel, without kindness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">traitorous, reckless, self-important, loving pleasure more than God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">even having the appearance of piety while rejecting its virtue. And so, avoid them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For among these are ones who penetrate houses and lead away, like captives, foolish women burdened with sins, who are led away by means of various desires,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">always learning, yet never achieving knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And in the same manner that Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so also will these resist the truth, men corrupted in mind, reprobates from the faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But they will not advance beyond a certain point. For the folly of the latter shall be made manifest to all, just as that of the former.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But you have fully comprehended my doctrine, instruction, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">persecutions, afflictions; such things as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra; how I endured persecutions, and how the Lord rescued me from everything.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And all those who willingly live the piety in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But evil men and deceivers will advance in evil, erring and sending into error.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Yet truly, you should remain in those things which you have learned and which have been entrusted to you. For you know from whom you have learned them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And, from your infancy, you have known the Sacred Scriptures, which are able to instruct you toward salvation, through the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">All Scripture, having been divinely inspired, is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in justice,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">so that the man of God may be perfect, having been trained for every good work.</p>
