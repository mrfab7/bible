<div class="chapter" data-book="Philippians" data-chapter="4" data-translation="King James Bible" data-translation-id="kjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, [my] dearly beloved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and [with] other my fellowlabourers, whose names [are] in the book of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Rejoice in the Lord alway: [and] again I say, Rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord [is] at hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things [are] honest, whatsoever things [are] just, whatsoever things [are] pure, whatsoever things [are] lovely, whatsoever things [are] of good report; if [there be] any virtue, and if [there be] any praise, think on these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Those things, which ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in me, do: and the God of peace shall be with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, [therewith] to be content.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I know both how to be abased, and I know how to abound: every where and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate with my affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Now ye Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things [which were sent] from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now unto God and our Father [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me greet you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesarâ€™s household.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all. Amen.</p>
