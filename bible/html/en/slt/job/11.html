<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Zophar the Naamathite will answer and say,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Shall not the multitude of words be answered? and shall a man of lips be justified?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Shall thy empty talks cause men to be silent? and wilt thou deride and none making ashamed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And thou wilt say, My instruction is pure, and I was clean in thine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And who Will give God speaking, and he will open his lips with thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he shall announce to thee hidden things of wisdom, for they are the double for understanding. And know thou that God will set to thee from thine iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Searching shalt thou and God? Shalt thou find the Almighty even to completeness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The heavens being high, what wilt thou do? Hades being deep, what wilt thou know?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Its measure long above the earth, and broad above the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If he shall pass on, and shut up, and gather together, who shall turn him back.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For he knew men of vanity, and he will see iniquity; and will he not understand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And man being empty will be without heart: and man will be born a wild assâ€™s colt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If thou preparedst thy heart, and didst spread thy hands towards him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If iniquity in thy hand, remove it far off, and wickedness shall not dwell in thy tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For then thou shalt lift up thy face from spot; and thou wert firm, and thou shalt not fear:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For thou shalt forget toil, then shalt remember as waters they passed away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And life shall rise above the noonday: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And thou didst trust, for there is hope; and thou didst search out; thou shalt lie down confidently.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And thou shalt lie down and none terrifying; and many waited for thy face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the eyes of the unjust shall be consumed, and flight shall perish from them, and their hope a breathing out of the soul.</p>
