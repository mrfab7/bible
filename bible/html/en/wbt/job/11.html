<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Should thy falsehoods make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thy eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But Oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thy iniquity deserveth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty to perfection?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The measure of it is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If he shall cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For vain man would be wise, though man is born like a wild assâ€™s colt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If thou preparest thy heart, and stretchest out thy hands towards him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If iniquity is in thy hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yes, thou shalt be steadfast, and shalt not fear:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And thy age shall be clearer than the noon-day: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yes, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yes, many shall make suit to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the expiration of the breath.</p>
