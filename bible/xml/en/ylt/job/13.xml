  <verse number="1">Lo, all—hath mine eye seen, Heard hath mine ear, and it attendeth to it.</verse>
  <verse number="2">According to your knowledge I have known—also I. I am not fallen more than you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Yet I for the Mighty One do speak, And to argue for God I delight.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And yet, ye are forgers of falsehood, Physicians of nought—all of you,</verse>
  <verse number="5">O that ye would keep perfectly silent, And it would be to you for wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Hear, I pray you, my argument, And to the pleadings of my lips attend,</verse>
  <verse number="7">For God do ye speak perverseness? And for Him do ye speak deceit?</verse>
  <verse number="8">His face do ye accept, if for God ye strive?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Is it good that He doth search you, If, as one mocketh at a man, ye mock at Him?</verse>
  <verse number="10">He doth surely reprove you, if in secret ye accept faces.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Doth not His excellency terrify you? And His dread fall upon you?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Your remembrances are similes of ashes, For high places of clay your heights.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Keep silent from me, and I speak, And pass over me doth what?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth? And my soul put in my hand?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Lo, He doth slay me—I wait not! Only, my ways unto His face I argue.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Also—He is to me for salvation, For the profane cometh not before Him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Hear ye diligently my word, And my declaration with your ears.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Lo, I pray you, I have set in order the cause, I have known that I am righteous.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Who is he that doth strive with me? For now I keep silent and gasp.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Only two things, O God, do with me: Then from Thy face I am not hidden.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Thy hand put far off from me, And Thy terror let not terrify me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And call Thou, and I—I answer, Or—I speak, and answer Thou me.</verse>
  <verse number="23">How many iniquities and sins have I? My transgression and my sin let me know.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Why dost Thou hide Thy face? And reckonest me for an enemy to Thee?</verse>
  <verse number="25">A leaf driven away dost Thou terrify? And the dry stubble dost Thou pursue?</verse>
  <verse number="26">For Thou writest against me bitter things, And causest me to possess iniquities of my youth:</verse>
  <verse number="27">And puttest in the stocks my feet, And observest all my paths, On the roots of my feet Thou settest a print,</verse>
  <verse number="28">And he, as a rotten thing, weareth away, As a garment hath a moth consumed him.</verse>
