<chapter book="Jeremiah" number="17" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond: it is graven on the table of their heart, and on the horns of your altars;</verse>
  <verse number="2">Whilst their children remember their altars and their groves by the green trees on the high hills.</verse>
  <verse number="3">O my mountain in the field, I will give your substance and all your treasures to the spoil, and your high places for sin, throughout all your borders.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And you, even yourself, shall discontinue from your heritage that I gave you; and I will cause you to serve your enemies in the land which you know not: for you have kindled a fire in my anger, which shall burn for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thus said the LORD; Cursed be the man that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm, and whose heart departs from the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good comes; but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Blessed is the man that trusts in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreads out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat comes, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?</verse>
  <verse number="10">I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings.</verse>
  <verse number="11">As the partridge sits on eggs, and hatches them not; so he that gets riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the middle of his days, and at his end shall be a fool.</verse>
  <verse number="12">A glorious high throne from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.</verse>
  <verse number="13">O LORD, the hope of Israel, all that forsake you shall be ashamed, and they that depart from me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD, the fountain of living waters.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Heal me, O LORD, and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved: for you are my praise.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Behold, they say to me, Where is the word of the LORD? let it come now.</verse>
  <verse number="16">As for me, I have not hastened from being a pastor to follow you: neither have I desired the woeful day; you know: that which came out of my lips was right before you.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Be not a terror to me: you are my hope in the day of evil.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Let them be confounded that persecute me, but let not me be confounded: let them be dismayed, but let not me be dismayed: bring on them the day of evil, and destroy them with double destruction.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Thus said the LORD to me; Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by the which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;</verse>
  <verse number="20">And say to them, Hear you the word of the LORD, you kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:</verse>
  <verse number="21">Thus said the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem;</verse>
  <verse number="22">Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do you any work, but hallow you the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And it shall come to pass, if you diligently listen to me, said the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, to the house of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But if you will not listen to me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.</verse>
