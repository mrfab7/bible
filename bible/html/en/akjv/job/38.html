<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="38" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Gird up now your loins like a man; for I will demand of you, and answer you me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if you have understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who has laid the measures thereof, if you know? or who has stretched the line on it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddling cloth for it,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And broke up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And said, Till now shall you come, but no further: and here shall your proud waves be stayed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Have you commanded the morning since your days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And from the wicked their light is withheld, and the high arm shall be broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Have you entered into the springs of the sea? or have you walked in the search of the depth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Have the gates of death been opened to you? or have you seen the doors of the shadow of death?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Have you perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if you know it all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Where is the way where light dwells? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">That you should take it to the bound thereof, and that you should know the paths to the house thereof?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Know you it, because you were then born? or because the number of your days is great?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Have you entered into the treasures of the snow? or have you seen the treasures of the hail,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">By what way is the light parted, which scatters the east wind on the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Who has divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Has the rain a father? or who has begotten the drops of dew?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who has gendered it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Can you bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Can you bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or can you guide Arcturus with his sons?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Know you the ordinances of heaven? can you set the dominion thereof in the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Can you send lightning, that they may go and say to you, Here we are?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Who has put wisdom in the inward parts? or who has given understanding to the heart?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">When the dust grows into hardness, and the clods stuck fast together?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Will you hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Who provides for the raven his food? when his young ones cry to God, they wander for lack of meat.</p>
