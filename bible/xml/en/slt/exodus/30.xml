  <verse number="1">And make an altar for burning incense: of acacia wood shalt thou make it.</verse>
  <verse number="2">A cubit its length, a cubit its breadth; it shall be four-square; and two cubits its height: its horns out of it.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And spread it over with pure gold its top, and its walls round about, and its horns: and make to it a gold wreath round about.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And two gold rings shalt thou make to it from under its crown, upon its two ribs, shalt thou make upon its two sides; and it was for inner parts for staves to lift it up by them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And make staves of acacia wood, and spread them over with gold.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And give it before the vail that is upon the ark of the testimonies, before the cover which is upon the testimonies, where I will meet with thee there.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Aaron to burn upon it incense of spices in the morning: in the morning in his adorning the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And in Aaron’s causing the lamps, to ascend between the two evenings, he shall burn incense upon it; continually before Jehovah for your generations.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And ye shall not bring up upon it strange incense; and a burnt-offering, a sacrifice and a libation thou shalt not pour out upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Aaron to expiate upon its horns once in a year, from the blood of the sin of the expiation: once in a year he shall expiate upon it for your generations: it is holy of holies to Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="12">When thou shalt take up the head of the sons of Israel for their reviewing, and they gave each a ransom of his soul to Jehovah, and in reviewing them; and a stumble shall not be in them in reviewing them.</verse>
  <verse number="13">This they shall give, all passing by upon their reviewing, from half the shekel by the holy shekel; (twenty gerahs the shekel:) from half a shekel an offering to Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="14">All passing by upon their reviewing, from the son of twenty years and above, shall give an offering to Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The rich one shall not multiply, and the poor one shall not diminish from half the shekel, to give an offering to Jehovah to expiate for your souls.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And take the silver of the expiations from the sons of Israel and give it for the work of the tent of appointment; and it was for the sons of Israel a remembrance before Jehovah to expiate for your souls.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="18">Make a brass wash-basin, and its pedestal brass, for washing: and give it between the tent of appointment and between the altar, and give water there.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Aaron and his son washed from it their hands and their feet.</verse>
  <verse number="20">In their coming into the tent of appointment, they shall wash with water, and they shall not die: or in their drawing near to the altar to serve, to burn a sacrifice to Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they shall wash their hands and their feet, and they shall not die: and it was to them a law forever, to him and to his seed and to their generations.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Take thou to thee spices of head of flowing myrrh, five hundred: and fragrant cinnamon of its half, fifty and two hundred; and fragrant reed, fifty and two hundred.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And cassia, five hundred by the holy shekel, and the oil of olive, a hin:</verse>
  <verse number="25">And make it an oil a holy anointing, a perfumed unguent the work of the perfumer: it shall be an oil a holy anointing.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And anoint the tent of appointment, and the ark of the testimony,</verse>
  <verse number="27">And the table and all its vessels and the chandelier and its vessels, and the altar of incense,</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the altar of burnt-offering and all its vessels, and the wash-basin and its pedestal.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And consecrate them, and they shall be holy of holies; every one touching upon them shall be holy.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And Aaron and his sons thou shalt anoint and consecrate them to be priests to me.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And to the sons of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, An oil a holy anointing shall this be to me for your generations.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Upon the flesh of man it shall not be poured, and according to its measure ye shall not make like it: it is holy; holy shall it be to you.</verse>
  <verse number="33">A man who shall perfume like it, and shall give to the stranger, and he shall be cut off from his people.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Jehovah will say to Moses, Take to thee aromatics, resin, and onycha, and galbanum; aromatics and pure frankincense: it shall be part for part.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And make it a perfume, an ointment, a work of the perfumer, salted, pure, holy.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And pound fine from it to small dust, and give from it before the testimony in the tent of appointment where I will meet with thee there: holy of holies, shall it be to you.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And the perfume which thou shalt make, according to its measure ye shall not make to you: it shall be holy to you for Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="38">A man who shall make like it to smell in it, and he shall be cut off from his people.</verse>
