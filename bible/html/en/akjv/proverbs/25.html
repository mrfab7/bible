<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="25" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honor of kings is to search out a matter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Put not forth yourself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For better it is that it be said to you, Come up here; than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince whom your eyes have seen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Go not forth hastily to strive, lest you know not what to do in the end thereof, when your neighbor has put you to shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Debate your cause with your neighbor himself; and discover not a secret to another:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Lest he that hears it put you to shame, and your infamy turn not away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover on an obedient ear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refreshes the soul of his masters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Whoever boasts himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaks the bone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Have you found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for you, lest you be filled therewith, and vomit it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Withdraw your foot from your neighborâ€™s house; lest he be weary of you, and so hate you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">A man that bears false witness against his neighbor is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">As he that takes away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar on nitre, so is he that singes songs to an heavy heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">If your enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For you shall heap coals of fire on his head, and the LORD shall reward you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The north wind drives away rain: so does an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He that has no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.</p>
