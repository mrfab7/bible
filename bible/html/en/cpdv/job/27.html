<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Job also added to this, using figures of speech, and he said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As God lives, who has taken away my judgment, and the Almighty, who has led my soul to bitterness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">as long as my breath remains in me and the breath of God remains in my nostrils,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">my lips will not speak iniquity, nor will my tongue devise lies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Far be it from me that I should judge you to be right, for, until I expire, I will not withdraw from my innocence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I will not forsake my justification, which I have just begun to grasp, for my heart does not find blame for me in my whole life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Let the impious be as my enemy, and the sinful, as my adversary.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For what hope is there for the hypocrite, if he greedily plunders and God does not free his soul?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Will God pay attention to his cry, when anguish overcomes him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Or will he take delight in the Almighty and call upon God at all times?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I will teach you through the hand of God, what the Almighty holds, and I will not conceal it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Behold, you know all this, and so why do you speak vain things without a reason?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">This is the portion of the impious man with God, and the inheritance of the violent, which they will receive from the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If his sons should happen to increase, they will be for the sword, and his grandsons will not be satisfied with bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Whatever will remain of him will be buried in the ruins, and his widows will not weep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If he will amass silver as if it were dirt and fabricate garments as if they were clay,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">then yes, he will gather, but the just will be clothed with it and the innocent will divide the silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He has built his house like a moth, and he has made a makeshift shelter like a sentry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">When he falls asleep, the rich man will leave him with nothing; he will open his eyes and find nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Destitution will surround him like water; a storm will overwhelm him in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">A burning wind will pick him up and carry him away, and, like a whirlwind, it will rush him from his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And it will hurl over him and will not spare him; fleeing from its power, he will go into exile.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He will clasp his hands over himself, and he will hiss at himself, while considering his situation.</p>
