  <verse number="1">Then came certain of the elders of Israel unto me, and sat before me.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="3">Son of man, these men have taken their idols into their heart, and put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be inquired of at all by them?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Therefore speak unto them, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Every man of the house of Israel that taketh his idols into his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet; I the LORD will answer him therein according to the multitude of his idols;</verse>
  <verse number="5">that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Return ye, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For every one of the house of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, which separateth himself from me, and taketh his idols into his heart, and putteth the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and cometh to the prophet to inquire for himself of me; I the LORD will answer him by myself:</verse>
  <verse number="8">and I will set my face against that man, and will make him an astonishment, for a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the midst of my people; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And if the prophet be deceived and speaketh a word, I the LORD have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they shall bear their iniquity: the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him that seeketh unto him;</verse>
  <verse number="11">that the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, neither defile themselves any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="13">Son of man, when a land sinneth against me by committing a trespass, and I stretch out mine hand upon it, and break the staff of the bread thereof, and send famine upon it, and cut off from it man and beast;</verse>
  <verse number="14">though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
  <verse number="15">If I cause noisome beasts to pass through the land, and they spoil it, so that it be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts;</verse>
  <verse number="16">though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; they only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off from it man and beast;</verse>
  <verse number="18">though these three men were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD; they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Or if I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast:</verse>
  <verse number="20">though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, as I live, saith the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For thus saith the Lord GOD: How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beasts, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?</verse>
  <verse number="22">Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be carried forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings: and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they shall comfort you, when ye see their way and their doings: and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
