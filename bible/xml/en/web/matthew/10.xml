  <verse number="1">He called to himself his twelve disciples, and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every sickness.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Now the names of the twelve apostles are these. The first, Simon, who is called Peter; Andrew, his brother; James the son of Zebedee; John, his brother;</verse>
  <verse number="3">Philip; Bartholomew; Thomas; Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus; Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;</verse>
  <verse number="4">Simon the Canaanite; and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Jesus sent these twelve out, and commanded them, saying, “Don’t go among the Gentiles, and don’t enter into any city of the Samaritans.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Rather, go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="7">As you go, preach, saying, ‘The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand!’</verse>
  <verse number="8">Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, and cast out demons. Freely you received, so freely give.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Don’t take any gold, nor silver, nor brass in your money belts.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Take no bag for your journey, neither two coats, nor shoes, nor staff: for the laborer is worthy of his food.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Into whatever city or village you enter, find out who in it is worthy; and stay there until you go on.</verse>
  <verse number="12">As you enter into the household, greet it.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If the household is worthy, let your peace come on it, but if it isn’t worthy, let your peace return to you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Whoever doesn’t receive you, nor hear your words, as you go out of that house or that city, shake off the dust from your feet.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Most certainly I tell you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.</verse>
  <verse number="16">“Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves. Therefore be wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to councils, and in their synagogues they will scourge you.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Yes, and you will be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the nations.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But when they deliver you up, don’t be anxious how or what you will say, for it will be given you in that hour what you will say.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">“Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child. Children will rise up against parents, and cause them to be put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="22">You will be hated by all men for my name’s sake, but he who endures to the end will be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But when they persecute you in this city, flee into the next, for most certainly I tell you, you will not have gone through the cities of Israel, until the Son of Man has come.</verse>
  <verse number="24">“A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his lord.</verse>
  <verse number="25">It is enough for the disciple that he be like his teacher, and the servant like his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more those of his household!</verse>
  <verse number="26">Therefore don’t be afraid of them, for there is nothing covered that will not be revealed; and hidden that will not be known.</verse>
  <verse number="27">What I tell you in the darkness, speak in the light; and what you hear whispered in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Don’t be afraid of those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. Rather, fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.</verse>
  <verse number="29">“Aren’t two sparrows sold for an assarion coin? Not one of them falls on the ground apart from your Father’s will,</verse>
  <verse number="30">but the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Therefore don’t be afraid. You are of more value than many sparrows.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Everyone therefore who confesses me before men, him I will also confess before my Father who is in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="33">But whoever denies me before men, him I will also deny before my Father who is in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="34">“Don’t think that I came to send peace on the earth. I didn’t come to send peace, but a sword.</verse>
  <verse number="35">For I came to set a man at odds against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</verse>
  <verse number="36">A man’s foes will be those of his own household.</verse>
  <verse number="37">He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he who loves son or daughter more than me isn’t worthy of me.</verse>
  <verse number="38">He who doesn’t take his cross and follow after me, isn’t worthy of me.</verse>
  <verse number="39">He who seeks his life will lose it; and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.</verse>
  <verse number="40">He who receives you receives me, and he who receives me receives him who sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="41">He who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward. He who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s reward.</verse>
  <verse number="42">Whoever gives one of these little ones just a cup of cold water to drink in the name of a disciple, most certainly I tell you he will in no way lose his reward.”</verse>
