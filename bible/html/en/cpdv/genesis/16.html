<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now Sarai, the wife of Abram, had not conceived children. But, having an Egyptian handmaid named Hagar,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">she said to her husband: “Behold, the Lord has closed me, lest I give birth. Enter to my handmaid, so that perhaps I may receive sons of her at least.” And when he agreed to her supplication,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">she took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid, ten years after they began to live in the land of Canaan, and she gave her to her husband as a wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he entered to her. But when she saw that she had conceived, she despised her mistress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Sarai said to Abram: “You have acted unfairly against me. I gave my handmaid into your bosom, who, when she saw that she had conceived, held me in contempt. May the Lord judge between me and you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Abram responded to her by saying, “Behold, your handmaid is in your hand to treat as it pleases you.” And so, when Sarai afflicted her, she took flight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And when the Angel of the Lord had found her, near the fountain of water in the wilderness, which is on the way to Shur in the desert,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">he said to her: “Hagar, handmaid of Sarai, where have you come from? And where will you go?” And she answered, “I flee from the face of Sarai, my mistress.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the Angel of the Lord said to her, “Return to your mistress, and humble yourself under her hand.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And again he said, “I will multiply your offspring continuously, and they will not be numbered because of their multitude.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But thereafter he said: “Behold, you have conceived, and you will give birth to a son. And you shall call his name Ishmael, because the Lord has heard your affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He will be a wild man. His hand will be against all, and all hands will be against him. And he will pitch his tents away from the region of all his brothers.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Then she called upon the name of the Lord who had spoken to her: “You are the God who has seen me.” For she said, “Certainly, here I have seen the back of the one who sees me.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Because of this, she called that well: ‘The well of the one who lives and who sees me.’ The same is between Kadesh and Bered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Hagar gave birth to a son for Abram, who called his name Ishmael.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael for him.</p>
