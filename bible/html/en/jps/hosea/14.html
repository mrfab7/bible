<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Return, O Israel, unto the LORD thy God; For thou hast stumbled in thine iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Take with you words, And return unto the LORD; Say unto Him: ‘Forgive all iniquity, And accept that which is good; So will we render for bullocks the offering of our lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Asshur shall not save us; We will not ride upon horses; Neither will we call any more the work of our hands our gods; For in Thee the fatherless findeth mercy.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely; For Mine anger is turned away from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I will be as the dew unto Israel; He shall blossom as the lily, And cast forth his roots as Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">His branches shall spread, And his beauty shall be as the olive-tree, And his fragrance as Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They that dwell under his shadow shall again Make corn to grow, And shall blossom as the vine; The scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Ephraim [shall say]: ‘What have I to do any more with idols?’ As for Me, I respond and look on him; I am like a leafy cypress-tree; From Me is thy fruit found.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Whoso is wise, let him understand these things, Whoso is prudent, let him know them. For the ways of the LORD are right, And the just do walk in them; But transgressors do stumble therein.</p>
