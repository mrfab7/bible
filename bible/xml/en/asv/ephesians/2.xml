  <verse number="1">And you did he make alive, when ye were dead through your trespasses and sins,</verse>
  <verse number="2">wherein ye once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the powers of the air, of the spirit that now worketh in the sons of disobedience;</verse>
  <verse number="3">among whom we also all once lived in the lusts of our flesh, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, even as the rest:—</verse>
  <verse number="4">but God, being rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,</verse>
  <verse number="5">even when we were dead through our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace have ye been saved),</verse>
  <verse number="6">and raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places, in Christ Jesus:</verse>
  <verse number="7">that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus:</verse>
  <verse number="8">for by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God;</verse>
  <verse number="9">not of works, that no man should glory.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God afore prepared that we should walk in them.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Wherefore remember, that once ye, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called Circumcision, in the flesh, made by hands;</verse>
  <verse number="12">that ye were at that time separate from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But now in Christ Jesus ye that once were far off are made nigh in the blood of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For he is our peace, who made both one, and brake down the middle wall of partition,</verse>
  <verse number="15">having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; that he might create in himself of the two one new man, so making peace;</verse>
  <verse number="16">and might reconcile them both in one body unto God through the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:</verse>
  <verse number="17">and he came and preached peace to you that were far off, and peace to them that were nigh:</verse>
  <verse number="18">for through him we both have our access in one Spirit unto the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="19">So then ye are no more strangers and sojourners, but ye are fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God,</verse>
  <verse number="20">being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the chief corner stone;</verse>
  <verse number="21">in whom each several building, fitly framed together, groweth into a holy temple in the Lord;</verse>
  <verse number="22">in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God in the Spirit.</verse>
