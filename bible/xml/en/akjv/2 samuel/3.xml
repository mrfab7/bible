<chapter book="2 Samuel" number="3" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And to David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;</verse>
  <verse number="3">And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the fourth, Adonijah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah the son of Abital;</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And it came to pass, while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah: and Ishbosheth said to Abner, Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog’s head, which against Judah do show kindness this day to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David, that you charge me to day with a fault concerning this woman?</verse>
  <verse number="9">So do God to Abner, and more also, except, as the LORD has sworn to David, even so I do to him;</verse>
  <verse number="10">To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he could not answer Abner a word again, because he feared him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? saying also, Make your league with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with you, to bring about all Israel to you.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he said, Well; I will make a league with you: but one thing I require of you, that is, You shall not see my face, except you first bring Michal Saul’s daughter, when you come to see my face.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth Saul’s son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for an hundred foreskins of the Philistines.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Ishbosheth sent, and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel the son of Laish.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then said Abner to him, Go, return. And he returned.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, You sought for David in times past to be king over you:</verse>
  <verse number="18">Now then do it: for the LORD has spoken of David, saying, By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel out of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all their enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin: and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel, and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.</verse>
  <verse number="20">So Abner came to David to Hebron, and twenty men with him. And David made Abner and the men that were with him a feast.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Abner said to David, I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a league with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires. And David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And, behold, the servants of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop, and brought in a great spoil with them: but Abner was not with David in Hebron; for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.</verse>
  <verse number="23">When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then Joab came to the king, and said, What have you done? behold, Abner came to you; why is it that you have sent him away, and he is quite gone?</verse>
  <verse number="25">You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you do.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, which brought him again from the well of Sirah: but David knew it not.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And when Abner was returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly, and smote him there under the fifth rib, that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the LORD for ever from the blood of Abner the son of Ner:</verse>
  <verse number="29">Let it rest on the head of Joab, and on all his father’s house; and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that has an issue, or that is a leper, or that leans on a staff, or that falls on the sword, or that lacks bread.</verse>
  <verse number="30">So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And David said to Joab, and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes, and gird you with sackcloth, and mourn before Abner. And king David himself followed the bier.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And they buried Abner in Hebron: and the king lifted up his voice, and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And the king lamented over Abner, and said, Died Abner as a fool dies?</verse>
  <verse number="34">Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put into fetters: as a man falls before wicked men, so fell you. And all the people wept again over him.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And when all the people came to cause David to eat meat while it was yet day, David swore, saying, So do God to me, and more also, if I taste bread, or ought else, till the sun be down.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them: as whatever the king did pleased all the people.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner the son of Ner.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And the king said to his servants, Know you not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?</verse>
  <verse number="39">And I am this day weak, though anointed king; and these men the sons of Zeruiah be too hard for me: the LORD shall reward the doer of evil according to his wickedness.</verse>
