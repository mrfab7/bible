  <verse number="1">The burden of the word of the LORD. In the land of Hadrach, And in Damascus shall be His resting-place; For the LORD’S is the eye of man And all the tribes of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Hamath also shall border thereon; Tyre and Zidon, for she is very wise.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Tyre did build herself a stronghold, And heaped up silver as the dust, And fine gold as the mire of the streets.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Behold, the Lord will impoverish her, And He will smite her power into the sea; And she shall be devoured with fire.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Ashkelon shall see it, and fear, Gaza also, and shall be sore pained, And Ekron, for her expectation shall be ashamed; And the king shall perish from Gaza, And Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, And I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, And his detestable things from between his teeth, And he also shall be a remnant for our God; And he shall be as a chief in Judah, And Ekron as a Jebusite.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And I will encamp about My house against the army, That none pass through or return; And no oppressor shall pass through them any more; For now have I seen with Mine eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion, Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem; Behold, thy king cometh unto thee, He is triumphant, and victorious, Lowly, and riding upon an ass, Even upon a colt the foal of an ass.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, And the horse from Jerusalem, And the battle bow shall be cut off, And he shall speak peace unto the nations; And his dominion shall be from sea to sea, And from the River to the ends of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="11">As for thee also, because of the blood of thy covenant I send forth thy prisoners out of the pit Wherein is no water.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Return to the stronghold, Ye prisoners of hope; Even to-day do I declare That I will render double unto thee.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For I bend Judah for Me, I fill the bow with Ephraim; And I will stir up thy sons, O Zion, Against thy sons, O Javan, And will make thee as the sword of a mighty man.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the LORD shall be seen over them, And His arrow shall go forth as the lightning; And the Lord GOD will blow the horn, And will go with whirlwinds of the south.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The LORD of hosts will defend them; And they shall devour, and shall tread down the sling-stones; And they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; And they shall be filled like the basins, like the corners of the altar.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the LORD their God shall save them in that day As the flock of His people; For they shall be as the stones of a crown, Glittering over His land.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For how great is their goodness, and how great is their beauty! Corn shall make the young men flourish, And new wine the maids.</verse>
