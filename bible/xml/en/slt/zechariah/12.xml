  <verse number="1">The Lifting up of the word of Jehovah for Israel, says Jehovah, stretching forth the heavens and founding the earth, and forming the spirit of man in the midst of him.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Behold, I set Jerusalem a dish of reeling to all peoples round about, and against Judah shall he be in the straitness against Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And it was in that day I will set Jerusalem a stone of burden to all peoples: all loading her, being out; shall be cut; and all the nations of the earth were gathered together against her.</verse>
  <verse number="4">In that day, says Jehovah, I will strike every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness: and upon the house of Judah I will open mine eyes, and every horse of the peoples I will strike with blindness.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the thousands of Judah said in their heart, The inhabitants of Jerusalem strength to me in Jehovah of armies their God.</verse>
  <verse number="6">In that day I will set the thousands of Judah as a fire-pan of fire among the woods, and as a torch of fire in a sheaf; and they devoured upon the right and upon the left all the peoples round about: and Jerusalem shall yet dwell in her place in Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Jehovah saved the tents of Judah first, so that the glorying of the house of David shall not be magnified, and the glorying of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, against Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="8">In that day Jehovah shall protect about the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and he being weak among them in that day was as David; and the house of David as God, as the messenger of Jehovah before them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And it was in that day I will seek to destroy all the nations coming against Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And I poured out upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and supplications: and they looked to me whom they pierced, and they mourned for him as mourning for the only begotten, and being embittered for him as being embittered for the first-born.</verse>
  <verse number="11">In that day the mourning shall be magnified as the mourning of Hadad-Rimmon in the valley of Megiddon.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the land mourned, families, families by themselves; the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of giving by itself, and their wives by themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of hearing by itself, and their wives by themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="14">All the families being left, families, families, by themselves, and their wives by themselves.</verse>
