<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him a house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel, for his kingdom was highly exalted, because of his people Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begot more sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And these are the names of the children which he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, and all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard [of it], and went out against them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And David inquired of God saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines, and wilt thou give them into my hand? And Jehovah said to him, Go up; and I will give them into thy hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And they came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and David said, God has broken in upon mine enemies by my hand, as the breaking forth of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And they left their gods there; and David commanded, and they were burned with fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the Philistines yet again spread themselves in the valley.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And David inquired again of God; and God said to him, Go not up after them; turn round them and come upon them opposite the mulberry-trees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And it shall be, when thou hearest the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle; for God will have gone forth before thee to smite the army of the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And David did as God commanded him; and they smote the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the fame of David went out into all lands; and Jehovah brought the fear of him upon all the nations.</p>
