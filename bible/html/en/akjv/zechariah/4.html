<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And said to me, What see you? And I said, I have looked, and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are on the top thereof:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And two olive trees by it, one on the right side of the bowl, and the other on the left side thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">So I answered and spoke to the angel that talked with me, saying, What are these, my lord?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then the angel that talked with me answered and said to me, Know you not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then he answered and spoke to me, saying, This is the word of the LORD to Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, said the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Who are you, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace to it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For who has despised the day of small things? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to and fro through the whole earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Then answered I, and said to him, What are these two olive trees on the right side of the candlestick and on the left side thereof?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And I answered again, and said to him, What be these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And he answered me and said, Know you not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by the LORD of the whole earth.</p>
