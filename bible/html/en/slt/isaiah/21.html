<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south for passing through, from the desert it came, from a fearful land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A hard vision was announced to me: The spoiler spoiled, and he laying waste, laid waste. Go up, O Elam: press, O Media; all her sighing I caused to cease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For this, my loins were filled with pain: distress took hold of me as the pains of her bringing forth: I was shaken from hearing; I trembled from seeing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">My heart wandered; trembling made me afraid: the evening twilight of my desire he put to me for fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Set in order the table; view the watch-tower; eat, drink: arise ye chiefs, anoint the shield.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For thus said Jehovah to me, Go set up a watchman, he shall announce what he shall see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He will see a chariot, a pair of horse men, the rider of an ass, the rider of a camel; and listening, he listened with much attention.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he will call, A lion: on the watch-tower my lord, I stand continually in the day, and upon my watch I stand all the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And behold, here came a chariot, a man, a pair of horsemen. And he will answer and say, She fell, Babel fell; and the carved images of her god he brake in pieces to the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">O my threshing, and the son of my threshing-floor, what I heard from Jehovah of armies the God of Israel, I announced to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The burden of Dumah. He called to me from Seir, Watch, what of the night? watch, what of the night?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The watch said, I will mark out morning, and also night; if ye will seek, seek ye: turn back, come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The burden of Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, ye wayfarers of Dedanim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">To meet the thirsty, bring ye water, O inhabitants of the land of Tema: anticipate ye him wandering, with bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For they fled from the face of the swords, the sword drawn out, and from the face of the bent bow, and from the face of the heaviness of war.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For thus said the Lord to me, Within yet a year; as the years of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar was finished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the rest of the bows of the strong sons of Kedar shall be few: for Jehovah God of Israel spake.</p>
