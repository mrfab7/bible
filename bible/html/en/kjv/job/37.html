<p class="verse" data-verse="1">At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound [that] goeth out of his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For he saith to the snow, Be thou [on] the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">How thy garments [are] warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south [wind]?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Hast thou with him spread out the sky, [which is] strong, [and] as a molten looking glass?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Teach us what we shall say unto him; [for] we cannot order [our speech] by reason of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And now [men] see not the bright light which [is] in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God [is] terrible majesty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">[Touching] the Almighty, we cannot find him out: [he is] excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any [that are] wise of heart.</p>
