1	For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
2	For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has provoked very many.
3	Yet have I sent the brothers, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, you may be ready:
4	Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, you) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.
5	Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers, that they would go before to you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof you had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.
6	But this I say, He which sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which sows bountifully shall reap also bountifully.
7	Every man according as he purposes in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver.
8	And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:
9	(As it is written, He has dispersed abroad; he has given to the poor: his righteousness remains for ever.
10	Now he that ministers seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)
11	Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causes through us thanksgiving to God.
12	For the administration of this service not only supplies the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings to God;
13	Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution to them, and to all men;
14	And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.
15	Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift.
