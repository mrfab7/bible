  <verse number="1">And his own house hath Solomon built thirteen years, and he finisheth all his house.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he buildeth the house of the forest of Lebanon; a hundred cubits is its length, and fifty cubits its breadth, and thirty cubits its height, on four rows of cedar pillars, and cedar-beams on the pillars;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and it is covered with cedar above, on the sides that are on the forty and five pillars, fifteen in the row.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And windows are in three rows, and sight is over-against sight three times.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And all the openings and the side-posts are square—windows; and sight is over-against sight three times.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the porch of the pillars he hath made; fifty cubits its length, and thirty cubits its breadth, and the porch is before them, and pillars and a thick place are before them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the porch of the throne where he judgeth—the porch of judgment—he hath made, and it is covered with cedar from the floor unto the floor.</verse>
  <verse number="8">As to his house where he dwelleth, the other court is within the porch—as this work it hath been; and a house he maketh for the daughter of Pharaoh—whom Solomon hath taken—like this porch.</verse>
  <verse number="9">All these are of precious stone, according to the measures of hewn work, sawn with a saw, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and at the outside, unto the great court.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the foundation is of precious stone, great stones, stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits;</verse>
  <verse number="11">and above are precious stone, according to the measures of hewn work, and cedar;</verse>
  <verse number="12">and the great court round about is three rows of hewn work, and a row of cedar-beams, even for the inner court of the house of Jehovah, and for the porch of the house.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And king Solomon sendeth and taketh Hiram out of Tyre—</verse>
  <verse number="14">he is son of a woman, a widow, of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father a man of Tyre, a worker in brass, and he is filled with the wisdom and the understanding, and the knowledge to do all work in brass—and he cometh unto king Solomon, and doth all his work.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he formeth the two pillars of brass; eighteen cubits is the height of the one pillar, and a cord of twelve cubits doth compass the second pillar.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And two chapiters he hath made to put on the tops of the pillars, cast in brass; five cubits the height of the one chapiter, and five cubits the height of the second chapiter.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Nets of net-work, wreaths of chain-work are for the chapiters that are on the top of the pillars, seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the second chapiter.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he maketh the pillars, and two rows round about on the one net-work, to cover the chapiters that are on the top, with the pomegranates, and so he hath made for the second chapiter.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the chapiters that are on the top of the pillars are of lily-work in the porch, four cubits;</verse>
  <verse number="20">and the chapiters on the two pillars also above, over-against the protuberance that is beside the net; and the pomegranates are two hundred, in rows round about on the second chapiter.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he raiseth up the pillars for the porch of the temple, and he raiseth up the right pillar, and calleth its name Jachin, and he raiseth up the left pillar, and calleth its name Boaz;</verse>
  <verse number="22">and on the top of the pillars is lily-work; and the work of the pillars is completed.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he maketh the molten sea, ten by the cubit from its edge unto its edge; it is round all about, and five by the cubit is its height, and a line of thirty by the cubit doth compass it round about;</verse>
  <verse number="24">and knops beneath its brim round about are compassing it, ten by the cubit, going round the sea round about; in two rows are the knops, cast in its being cast.</verse>
  <verse number="25">It is standing on twelve oxen, three facing the north, and three facing the west, and three facing the south, and three facing the east, and the sea is upon them above, and all their hinder parts are inward.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And its thickness is an handbreadth, and its edge as the work of the edge of a cup, flowers of lilies; two thousand baths it containeth.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he maketh the ten bases of brass; four by the cubit is the length of the one base, and four by the cubit its breadth, and three by the cubit its height.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And this is the work of the base: they have borders, and the borders are between the joinings;</verse>
  <verse number="29">and on the borders that are between the joinings are lions, oxen, and cherubs, and on the joinings a base above, and beneath the lions and the oxen are additions—sloping work.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And four wheels of brass are to the one base, and axles of brass; and its four corners have shoulders—under the laver are the molten shoulders, beside each addition.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And its mouth within the chapiter and above is by the cubit, and its mouth is round, the work of the base, a cubit and half a cubit; and also on its mouth are carvings and their borders, square, not round.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And the four wheels are under the borders, and the spokes of the wheels are in the base, and the height of the one wheel is a cubit and half a cubit.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And the work of the wheels is as the work of the wheel of a chariot, their spokes, and their axles, and their felloes, and their naves; the whole is molten.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And four shoulders are unto the four corners of the one base; out of the base are its shoulders.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And in the top of the base is the half of a cubit in the height all round about; and on the top of the base its spokes and its borders are of the same.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And he openeth on the tablets of its spokes, and on its borders, cherubs, lions, and palm-trees, according to the void space of each, and additions round about.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Thus he hath made the ten bases; one casting, one measure, one form, have they all.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And he maketh ten lavers of brass; forty baths doth the one laver contain, four by the cubit is the one laver, one laver on the one base is to the ten bases;</verse>
  <verse number="39">and he putteth the five bases on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house, and the sea he hath put on the right side of the house, eastward—over-against the south.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And Hiram maketh the lavers, and the shovels, and the bowls; and Hiram completeth to do all the work that he made for king Solomon, for the house of Jehovah;</verse>
  <verse number="41">pillars two, and bowls of the chapiters that are on the top of the pillars two, and the nets two, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that are on the top of the pillars;</verse>
  <verse number="42">and the pomegranates four hundred for the two nets, two rows of pomegranates for the one net, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that are on the front of the pillars;</verse>
  <verse number="43">and the ten bases, and the ten lavers on the bases;</verse>
  <verse number="44">and the one sea, the twelve oxen under the sea,</verse>
  <verse number="45">and the pots, and the shovels, and the bowls; and all these vessels, that Hiram hath made to king Solomon for the house of Jehovah, are of brass—polished.</verse>
  <verse number="46">In the circuit of the Jordan hath the king cast them, in the thick soil of the ground, between Succoth and Zarthan.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And Solomon placeth the whole of the vessels; because of the very great abundance, the weight of the brass hath not been searched out.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And Solomon maketh all the vessels that are in the house of Jehovah: the altar of gold, and the table—on which is the bread of the Presence—of gold,</verse>
  <verse number="49">and the candlesticks, five on the right, and five on the left, before the oracle, of refined gold, and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold,</verse>
  <verse number="50">and the basins, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and the censers, of refined gold, and the hinges for the doors of the inner-house, for the holy of holies, for the doors of the house of the temple, of gold.</verse>
  <verse number="51">And it is complete—all the work that king Solomon hath made for the house of Jehovah, and Solomon bringeth in the sanctified things of David his father; the silver, and the gold, and the vessels he hath put in the treasuries of the house of Jehovah.</verse>
