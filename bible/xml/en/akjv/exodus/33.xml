  <verse number="1">And the LORD said to Moses, Depart, and go up hence, you and the people which you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, To your seed will I give it:</verse>
  <verse number="2">And I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:</verse>
  <verse number="3">To a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the middle of you; for you are a stiff necked people: lest I consume you in the way.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man did put on him his ornaments.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For the LORD had said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, You are a stiff necked people: I will come up into the middle of you in a moment, and consume you: therefore now put off your ornaments from you, that I may know what to do to you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments by the mount Horeb.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one which sought the LORD went out to the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it came to pass, when Moses went out to the tabernacle, that all the people rose up, and stood every man at his tent door, and looked after Moses, until he was gone into the tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the Lord talked with Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose up and worshipped, every man in his tent door.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend. And he turned again into the camp: but his servant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Moses said to the LORD, See, you say to me, Bring up this people: and you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, I know you by name, and you have also found grace in my sight.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Now therefore, I pray you, if I have found grace in your sight, show me now your way, that I may know you, that I may find grace in your sight: and consider that this nation is your people.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he said, My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he said to him, If your presence go not with me, carry us not up hence.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For wherein shall it be known here that I and your people have found grace in your sight? is it not in that you go with us? so shall we be separated, I and your people, from all the people that are on the face of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the LORD said to Moses, I will do this thing also that you have spoken: for you have found grace in my sight, and I know you by name.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he said, I beseech you, show me your glory.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before you; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he said, You can not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and you shall stand on a rock:</verse>
  <verse number="22">And it shall come to pass, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand while I pass by:</verse>
  <verse number="23">And I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen.</verse>
