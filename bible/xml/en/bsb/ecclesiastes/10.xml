<chapter book="Ecclesiastes" number="10" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">As dead flies bring a stench to the perfumer’s oil, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.</verse>
  <verse number="2">A wise man’s heart inclines to the right, but the heart of a fool to the left.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Even as the fool walks along the road, his sense is lacking, and he shows everyone that he is a fool.</verse>
  <verse number="4">If the ruler’s temper flares against you, do not abandon your post, for calmness lays great offenses to rest.</verse>
  <verse number="5">There is an evil I have seen under the sun—an error that proceeds from the ruler:</verse>
  <verse number="6">Folly is appointed to great heights, but the rich sit in lowly positions.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I have seen slaves on horseback, while princes go on foot like slaves.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He who digs a pit may fall into it, and he who breaches a wall may be bitten by a snake.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The one who quarries stones may be injured by them, and he who splits logs endangers himself.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If the axe is dull and the blade unsharpened, more strength must be exerted, but skill produces success.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If the snake bites before it is charmed, there is no profit for the charmer.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious, but the lips of a fool consume him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The beginning of his talk is folly, and the end of his speech is evil madness.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Yet the fool multiplies words. No one knows what is coming, and who can tell him what will come after him?</verse>
  <verse number="15">The toil of a fool wearies him, for he does not know the way to the city.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Woe to you, O land whose king is a youth, and whose princes feast in the morning.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Blessed are you, O land whose king is a son of nobles, and whose princes feast at the proper time—for strength and not for drunkenness.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Through laziness the roof caves in, and in the hands of the idle, the house leaks.</verse>
  <verse number="19">A feast is prepared for laughter, and wine makes life merry, but money is the answer for everything.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Do not curse the king even in your thoughts, or curse the rich even in your bedroom, for a bird of the air may carry your words, and a winged creature may report your speech.</verse>
