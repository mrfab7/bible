<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then came to Jesus from Jerusalem the scribes and Pharisees, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Wherefore do thy disciples pass by the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he, having answered, said to them, Wherefore do ye also pass by the command of God by your tradition.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, he calumniating father or mother, in death let him die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And ye say, Whoever should say to father or mother, A gift, whatever thou shouldest be profited by me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And should not honour his father or his mother. And ye have annulled the command of God by your tradition.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">This people draw near me with their mouth, and honour me with their lips; but their heart keeps off far from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But they worship me in vain, teaching doctrines the commands of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And having called the crowd, he said to them, Hear ye, and understand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Not that coming into the mouth pollutes the man; but that going forth out of the mouth, this pollutes the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Then his disciples having come near, said to him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees, having heard the word, were scandalized?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And having answered, he said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Let them go: they are blind guides of the blind. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Peter, having answered, said to him, Explain to us this parable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Jesus said, Are ye also yet destitute of understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Do ye not yet understand, that everything going into the mouth proceeds to the belly, and is cast out in the privy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But the things going forth out of the mouth come from the heart, and these pollute the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For from the heart come forth evil reflections, slaughters, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, defamations:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">These are the things polluting a man: but to eat with unwashed hands pollutes not a man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Jesus, having gone forth from thence, withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And, behold, a woman, a Canaanite, having come forth from those boundaries, cried out to him, saying, Pity me, Lord, son of David; my daughter is badly possessed with an evil spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he answered her not a word. And his disciples, having come, asked him, saying, Loose her; for she cries out after us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And he, having answered, said, I was not sent except to the sheep having been lost, of the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And she, having come, worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And he, having answered, said, It is not good to take the childrenâ€™s bread, and cast it to the little dogs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And she said, Yes, Lord; for the little dogs also eat from the crumbs falling from the table of their lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Then Jesus, having answered, said to her, O woman, great thy faith: let it be to thee as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And having passed from thence, Jesus came to the sea of Galilee; and having gone up into a mountain, he sat there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And many crowds came to him, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them at the feet of Jesus; and he cured them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">So that the crowds wondered, seeing the dumb speaking, the maimed sound, the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they praised the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And Jesus having called his disciples, said, I feel compassion for the crowd, for already they remain with me three days, and they have nothing they could eat: and I will not leave them fasting, lest they be relaxed in the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And his disciples say to him, Whence to us, in a lonely place, so many loaves, to satisfy such a crowd?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And he says to them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And he encouraged the crowd to recline upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And having taken the seven loaves and the fishes, having returned thanks, he brake, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the crowd.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And all ate, and were satisfied: and they took up that remaining of the fragments seven wicker baskets full.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And they eating were four thousand men, besides women and children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And having loosed the crowds, he went into a ship, and came into the bounds of Magdala.</p>
