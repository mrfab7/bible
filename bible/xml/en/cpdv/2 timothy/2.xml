<chapter book="2 Timothy" number="2" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And as for you, my son, be strengthened by the grace which is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and by the things which you have heard from me through many witnesses. These things encourage faithful men, who shall then be suitable to teach others also.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Labor like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="4">No man, acting as a soldier for God, entangles himself in worldly matters, so that he may be pleasing to him for whom he has proven himself.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then, too, whoever strives in a competition is not crowned, unless he has competed lawfully.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The farmer who labors ought to be the first to share in the produce.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Understand what I am saying. For the Lord will give you understanding in all things.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Be mindful that the Lord Jesus Christ, who is the offspring of David, has risen again from the dead, according to my Gospel.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I labor in this Gospel, even while chained like an evildoer. But the Word of God is not bound.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I endure all things for this reason: for the sake of the elect, so that they, too, may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with heavenly glory.</verse>
  <verse number="11">It is a faithful saying: that if we have died with him, we will also live with him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">If we suffer, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he will also deny us.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If we are unfaithful, he remains faithful: he is not able to deny himself.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Insist on these things, testifying before the Lord. Do not be contentious about words, for this is useful for nothing but the subversion of listeners.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Be solicitous in the task of presenting yourself before God as a proven and unashamed worker who has handled the Word of Truth correctly.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But avoid profane or empty talk. For these things advance one greatly in impiety.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And their word spreads like a cancer: among these are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</verse>
  <verse number="18">who have fallen away from the truth by saying that the resurrection is already complete. And so they have subverted the faith of certain persons.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But the firm foundation of God remains standing, having this seal: the Lord knows those who are his own, and all who know the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But, in a large house, there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also those of wood and of clay; and certainly some are held in honor, but others in dishonor.</verse>
  <verse number="21">If anyone, then, will have cleansed himself from these things, he shall be a vessel held in honor, sanctified and useful to the Lord, prepared for every good work.</verse>
  <verse number="22">So then, flee from the desires of your youth, yet truly, pursue justice, faith, hope, charity, and peace, along with those who call upon the Lord from a pure heart.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But avoid foolish and undisciplined questions, for you know that these produce strife.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For the servant of the Lord must not be contentious, but instead he must be meek toward everyone, teachable, patient,</verse>
  <verse number="25">correcting with self-restraint those who resist the truth. For at any time God may give them repentance, so as to recognize the truth,</verse>
  <verse number="26">and then they may recover from the snares of the devil, by whom they are held captive at his will.</verse>
