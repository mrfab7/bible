  <verse number="1">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">How long will ye lay snares for words? Consider, and afterwards we will speak.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Wherefore are we counted as beasts, And reputed dull in your sight?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger, Shall the earth be forsaken for thee? Or shall the rock be removed out of its place?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, And the spark of his fire shall not shine.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The light shall be dark in his tent, And his lamp over him shall be put out.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The steps of his strength shall be straitened, And his own counsel shall cast him down.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For he is cast into a net by his own feet, And he walketh upon the toils.</verse>
  <verse number="9">A gin shall take him by the heel, And a snare shall lay hold on him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">A noose is hid for him in the ground, And a trap for him in the way.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Terrors shall overwhelm him on every side, And shall entrap him at his feet.</verse>
  <verse number="12">His trouble shall be ravenous, And calamity shall be ready for his fall.</verse>
  <verse number="13">It shall devour the members of his body, Yea, the first-born of death shall devour his members.</verse>
  <verse number="14">That wherein he trusteth shall be plucked out of his tent; And he shall be brought to the king of terrors.</verse>
  <verse number="15">There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his; Brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.</verse>
  <verse number="16">His roots shall dry up beneath, And above shall his branch wither.</verse>
  <verse number="17">His remembrance shall perish from the earth, And he shall have no name abroad.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He shall be driven from light into darkness, And chased out of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He shall have neither son nor son’s son among his people, Nor any remaining in his dwellings.</verse>
  <verse number="20">They that come after shall be astonished at his day, As they that went before are affrighted.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, And this is the place of him that knoweth not God.</verse>
