<div class="chapter" data-book="2 Corinthians" data-chapter="6" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And we helping do exhort you, that you receive not the grace of God in vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For he saith: In an accepted time have I heard thee; and in the day of salvation have I helped thee. Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Giving no offence to any man, that our ministry be not blamed:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But in all things let us exhibit ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulation, in necessities, in distresses,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">In stripes, in prisons, in seditions, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In chastity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in sweetness, in the Holy Ghost, in charity unfeigned,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armour of justice on the right hand and on the left;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet known;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">As dying, and behold we live; as chastised, and not killed;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as needy, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Our mouth is open to you, O ye Corinthians, our heart is enlarged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">You are not straitened in us, but in your own bowels you are straitened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But having the same recompense, (I speak as to my children,) be you also enlarged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Bear not the yoke with unbelievers. For what participation hath justice with injustice? Or what fellowship hath light with darkness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath the faithful with the unbeliever?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God; as God saith: I will dwell in them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Wherefore, Go out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And I will receive you; and I will be a Father to you; and you shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</p>
