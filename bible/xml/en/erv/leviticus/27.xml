  <verse number="1">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall accomplish a vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by thy estimation.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And if it be from sixty years old and upward; if it be a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall be set before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of him that vowed shall the priest value him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And if it be a beast, whereof men offer an oblation unto the LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer an oblation unto the LORD, then he shall set the beast before the priest:</verse>
  <verse number="12">and the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou the priest valuest it, so shall it be.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD part of the field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the sowing thereof: the sowing of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="17">If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to thy estimation it shall stand.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain unto the year of jubile, and an abatement shall be made from thy estimation.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And if he that sanctified the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more:</verse>
  <verse number="21">but the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest’s.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And if he sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which is not of the field of his possession;</verse>
  <verse number="23">then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation unto the year of jubile: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="24">In the year of jubile the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land belongeth.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Only the firstling among beasts, which is made a firstling to the LORD, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox or sheep, it is the LORD’S.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall ransom it according to thine estimation, and shall add unto it the fifth part thereof: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, whether of man or beast, or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="29">None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD’S: it is holy unto the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And if a man will redeem aught of his tithe, he shall add unto it the fifth part thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And all the tithe of the herd or the flock, whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="33">He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.</verse>
  <verse number="34">These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.</verse>
