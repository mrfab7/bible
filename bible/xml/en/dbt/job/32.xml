<chapter book="Job" number="32" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Then was kindled the anger of Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his anger kindled, because he justified himself rather than God;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and against his three friends was his anger kindled, because they found no answer, and [yet] condemned Job.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But Elihu had waited till Job had finished speaking, because they were older than he.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of the three men, and his anger was kindled.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are aged; wherefore I was timid, and feared to shew you what I know.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I said, Let days speak, and multitude of years teach wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But there is a spirit which is in man; and the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="9">It is not the great that are wise; neither do the aged understand judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore I say, Hearken to me; I also will shew what I know.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Lo, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasonings, until ye searched out what to say.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Yea, I gave you mine attention, and behold, there was none of you that confuted Job, that answered his words;</verse>
  <verse number="13">That ye may not say, We have found out wisdom; God will make him yield, not man.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Now he hath not directed [his] words against me; and I will not answer him with your speeches....</verse>
  <verse number="15">They were amazed, they answered no more; words failed them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And I waited, for they spoke not, but stood still, and answered no more;—</verse>
  <verse number="17">I will answer, I also in my turn, I also will shew what I know:</verse>
  <verse number="18">For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; like new flasks, it is ready to burst.</verse>
  <verse number="20">I will speak, that I may find relief; I will open my lips and answer.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Let me not, I pray you, accept any man’s person; neither will I give flattery to man.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For I know not how to flatter; my Maker would soon take me away.</verse>
