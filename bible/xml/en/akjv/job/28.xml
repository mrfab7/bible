<chapter book="Job" number="28" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.</verse>
  <verse number="3">He sets an end to darkness, and searches out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The flood breaks out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.</verse>
  <verse number="5">As for the earth, out of it comes bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it has dust of gold.</verse>
  <verse number="7">There is a path which no fowl knows, and which the vulture’s eye has not seen:</verse>
  <verse number="8">The lion’s whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He puts forth his hand on the rock; he overturns the mountains by the roots.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He cuts out rivers among the rocks; and his eye sees every precious thing.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He binds the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid brings he forth to light.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Man knows not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The depth said, It is not in me: and the sea said, It is not with me.</verse>
  <verse number="15">It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="16">It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.</verse>
  <verse number="18">No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.</verse>
  <verse number="20">From where then comes wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.</verse>
  <verse number="23">God understands the way thereof, and he knows the place thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For he looks to the ends of the earth, and sees under the whole heaven;</verse>
  <verse number="25">To make the weight for the winds; and he weighs the waters by measure.</verse>
  <verse number="26">When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:</verse>
  <verse number="27">Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yes, and searched it out.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And to man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.</verse>
