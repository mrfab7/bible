<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Brethren, if a man be taken in any fault, ye the spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; observing thyself narrowly, lest thou also be tempted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Bear one anotherâ€™s burdens, and so fill up the law of Christ:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For if any think to be something, being nothing, he deceives himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And let each try his own work, and then in himself alone will he have boasting, and not in another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For each shall bear his own load.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Let him being taught the word participate with him teaching in all good things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man should sow, that also shall he reap.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For he sowing to his flesh of the flesh shall reap corruption; but he sowing to the Spirit, of the Spirit shall reap eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And doing good let us not despond: for in proper time we shall reap, not being enervated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Wherefore then as we have time, let us work good to all, and chiefly to them of the household of faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">See ye how large letters I wrote to you with mine own hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">As many as: wish to have an agreeable demeanor in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only lest they should be driven out for the cross of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For neither they being circumcised themselves observe the law; but they wish you to be circumcised, that they might boast in your flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And it may not be to me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any power, nor uncircumcision but a new creation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And as many as walk by this model, place upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the rest let none cause me fatigues: for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus Christ in my body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with your spirit, brethren. Amen.</p>
