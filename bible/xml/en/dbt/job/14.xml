<chapter book="Job" number="14" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Man, born of woman, is of few days, and full of trouble.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down; and he fleeth as a shadow, and continueth not.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Yet dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who can bring a clean [man] out of the unclean? Not one!</verse>
  <verse number="5">If his days are determined, if the number of his months is with thee, [and] thou hast appointed his bounds which he must not pass,</verse>
  <verse number="6">Look away from him; and let him rest, till he accomplish, as a hireling, his day.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For there is hope for a tree: if it be cut down, it will sprout again, and its tender branch will not cease;</verse>
  <verse number="8">Though its root grow old in the earth, and its stock die in the ground,</verse>
  <verse number="9">Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and put forth boughs like a young plant.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But a man dieth, and is prostrate; yea, man expireth, and where is he?</verse>
  <verse number="11">The waters recede from the lake, and the river wasteth and drieth up:</verse>
  <verse number="12">So man lieth down, and riseth not again; till the heavens be no more, they do not awake, nor are raised out of their sleep.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Oh that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol, that thou wouldest keep me secret until thine anger be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me,—</verse>
  <verse number="14">(If a man die, shall he live [again]?) all the days of my time of toil would I wait, till my change should come:</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thou wouldest call, and I would answer thee; thou wouldest have a desire after the work of thy hands.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?</verse>
  <verse number="17">My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou heapest up mine iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And indeed a mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of its place;</verse>
  <verse number="19">The waters wear the stones, the floods thereof wash away the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth away; thou changest his countenance, and dismissest him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, and he perceiveth it not.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But his flesh hath pain for himself alone, and his soul mourneth for himself.</verse>
