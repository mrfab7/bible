  <verse number="1">The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Vanity of vanities,” says the Preacher; “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">What does man gain from all his labor in which he labors under the sun?</verse>
  <verse number="4">One generation goes, and another generation comes; but the earth remains forever.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, and hurries to its place where it rises.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The wind goes toward the south, and turns around to the north. It turns around continually as it goes, and the wind returns again to its courses.</verse>
  <verse number="7">All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full. To the place where the rivers flow, there they flow again.</verse>
  <verse number="8">All things are full of weariness beyond uttering. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</verse>
  <verse number="9">That which has been is that which shall be; and that which has been done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Is there a thing of which it may be said, “Behold, this is new?” It has been long ago, in the ages which were before us.</verse>
  <verse number="11">There is no memory of the former; neither shall there be any memory of the latter that are to come, among those that shall come after.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="13">I applied my heart to seek and to search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the sky. It is a heavy burden that God has given to the sons of men to be afflicted with.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and a chasing after wind.</verse>
  <verse number="15">That which is crooked can’t be made straight; and that which is lacking can’t be counted.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I said to myself, “Behold, I have obtained for myself great wisdom above all who were before me in Jerusalem. Yes, my heart has had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.”</verse>
  <verse number="17">I applied my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly. I perceived that this also was a chasing after wind.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For in much wisdom is much grief; and he who increases knowledge increases sorrow.</verse>
