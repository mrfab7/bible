<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="17" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Better is a dry morsel with quietness, than a house full of feasting with strife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A servant who deals wisely will rule over a son who causes shame, and shall have a part in the inheritance among the brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The refining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold, but Yahweh tests the hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">An evildoer heeds wicked lips. A liar gives ear to a mischievous tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Whoever mocks the poor reproaches his Maker. He who is glad at calamity shall not be unpunished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Children’s children are the crown of old men; the glory of children are their parents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Arrogant speech isn’t fitting for a fool, much less do lying lips fit a prince.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">A bribe is a precious stone in the eyes of him who gives it; wherever he turns, he prospers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He who covers an offense promotes love; but he who repeats a matter separates best friends.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A rebuke enters deeper into one who has understanding than a hundred lashes into a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">An evil man seeks only rebellion; therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let a bear robbed of her cubs meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whoever rewards evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The beginning of strife is like breaching a dam, therefore stop contention before quarreling breaks out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He who justifies the wicked, and he who condemns the righteous, both of them alike are an abomination to Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Why is there money in the hand of a fool to buy wisdom, since he has no understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A friend loves at all times; and a brother is born for adversity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">A man void of understanding strikes hands, and becomes collateral in the presence of his neighbor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He who loves disobedience loves strife. One who builds a high gate seeks destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">One who has a perverse heart doesn’t find prosperity, and one who has a deceitful tongue falls into trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He who becomes the father of a fool grieves. The father of a fool has no joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A cheerful heart makes good medicine, but a crushed spirit dries up the bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">A wicked man receives a bribe in secret, to pervert the ways of justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Wisdom is before the face of one who has understanding, but the eyes of a fool wander to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">A foolish son brings grief to his father, and bitterness to her who bore him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Also to punish the righteous is not good, nor to flog officials for their integrity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He who spares his words has knowledge. He who is even tempered is a man of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Even a fool, when he keeps silent, is counted wise. When he shuts his lips, he is thought to be discerning.</p>
