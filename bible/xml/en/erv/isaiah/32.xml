<chapter book="Isaiah" number="32" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall rule in judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear shall hearken.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will work iniquity, to practise profaneness, and to utter error against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and to cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked devices to destroy the meek with lying words, even when the needy speaketh right.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and in liberal things shall he continue.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Rise up, ye women that are at ease, and hear my voice; ye careless daughters, give ear unto my speech.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For days beyond a year shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shall fail, the ingathering shall not come.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon your loins.</verse>
  <verse number="12">They shall smite upon the breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city:</verse>
  <verse number="14">For the palace shall be forsaken; the populous city shall be deserted; the hill and the watch-tower shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;</verse>
  <verse number="15">until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be counted for a forest.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness shall abide in the fruitful field.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness quietness and confidence for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And my people shall abide in a peaceable habitation, and in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But it shall hail, in the downfall of the forest; and the city shall be utterly laid low.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth the feet of the ox and the ass.</verse>
