<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The word which Jeremiah the prophet spake to Baruch, son of Neriah, in his writing these words up on the book from the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year to Jehoiakim son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, to thee, O Baruch;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thou saidst, Wo to me now! for Jehovah added grief upon my pain; I was weary in my sighing, and I found not rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thus shalt thou say to him, Thus said Jehovah, Behold, what I built I pulled down, and what I planted I plucked up, and all this land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And thou, wilt thou seek great things to thyself? thou shalt not seek: for behold me bringing evil upon all flesh, says Jehovah: and I gave to thee thy soul for a booty to all the places where thou shalt go there.</p>
