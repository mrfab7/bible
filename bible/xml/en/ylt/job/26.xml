<chapter book="Job" number="26" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And Job answereth and saith:—</verse>
  <verse number="2">What—thou hast helped the powerless, Saved an arm not strong!</verse>
  <verse number="3">What—thou hast given counsel to the unwise, And wise plans in abundance made known.</verse>
  <verse number="4">With whom hast thou declared words? And whose breath came forth from thee?</verse>
  <verse number="5">The Rephaim are formed, Beneath the waters, also their inhabitants.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Naked is Sheol over-against Him, And there is no covering to destruction.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Stretching out the north over desolation, Hanging the earth upon nothing,</verse>
  <verse number="8">Binding up the waters in His thick clouds, And the cloud is not rent under them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Taking hold of the face of the throne, Spreading over it His cloud.</verse>
  <verse number="10">A limit He hath placed on the waters, Unto the boundary of light with darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Pillars of the heavens do tremble, And they wonder because of His rebuke.</verse>
  <verse number="12">By His power He hath quieted the sea, And by His understanding smitten the proud.</verse>
  <verse number="13">By His Spirit the heavens He beautified, Formed hath His hand the fleeing serpent.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Lo, these are the borders of His way, And how little a matter is heard of Him, And the thunder of His might Who doth understand?</verse>
