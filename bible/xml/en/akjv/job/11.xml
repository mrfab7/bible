  <verse number="1">Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Should your lies make men hold their peace? and when you mock, shall no man make you ashamed?</verse>
  <verse number="4">For you have said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in your eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against you;</verse>
  <verse number="6">And that he would show you the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Can you by searching find out God? can you find out the Almighty to perfection?</verse>
  <verse number="8">It is as high as heaven; what can you do? deeper than hell; what can you know?</verse>
  <verse number="9">The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?</verse>
  <verse number="11">For he knows vain men: he sees wickedness also; will he not then consider it?</verse>
  <verse number="12">For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass’s colt.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If you prepare your heart, and stretch out your hands toward him;</verse>
  <verse number="14">If iniquity be in your hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in your tabernacles.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For then shall you lift up your face without spot; yes, you shall be steadfast, and shall not fear:</verse>
  <verse number="16">Because you shall forget your misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:</verse>
  <verse number="17">And your age shall be clearer than the noonday: you shall shine forth, you shall be as the morning.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And you shall be secure, because there is hope; yes, you shall dig about you, and you shall take your rest in safety.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Also you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid; yes, many shall make suit to you.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.</verse>
