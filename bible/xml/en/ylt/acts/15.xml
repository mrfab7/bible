  <verse number="1">And certain having come down from Judea, were teaching the brethren—‘If ye be not circumcised after the custom of Moses, ye are not able to be saved;’</verse>
  <verse number="2">there having been, therefore, not a little dissension and disputation to Paul and Barnabas with them, they arranged for Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them, to go up unto the apostles and elders to Jerusalem about this question,</verse>
  <verse number="3">they indeed, then, having been sent forward by the assembly, were passing through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the nations, and they were causing great joy to all the brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And having come to Jerusalem, they were received by the assembly, and the apostles, and the elders, they declared also as many things as God did with them;</verse>
  <verse number="5">and there rose up certain of those of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying—‘It behoveth to circumcise them, to command them also to keep the law of Moses.’</verse>
  <verse number="6">And there were gathered together the apostles and the elders, to see about this matter,</verse>
  <verse number="7">and there having been much disputing, Peter having risen up said unto them, ‘Men, brethren, ye know that from former days, God among us did make choice, through my mouth, for the nations to hear the word of the good news, and to believe;</verse>
  <verse number="8">and the heart-knowing God did bare them testimony, having given to them the Holy Spirit, even as also to us,</verse>
  <verse number="9">and did put no difference also between us and them, by the faith having purified their hearts;</verse>
  <verse number="10">now, therefore, why do ye tempt God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</verse>
  <verse number="11">but, through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we believe to be saved, even as also they.’</verse>
  <verse number="12">And all the multitude did keep silence, and were hearkening to Barnabas and Paul, declaring as many signs and wonders as God did among the nations through them;</verse>
  <verse number="13">and after they are silent, James answered, saying, ‘Men, brethren, hearken to me;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Simeon did declare how at first God did look after to take out of the nations a people for His name,</verse>
  <verse number="15">and to this agree the words of the prophets, as it hath been written:</verse>
  <verse number="16">After these things I will turn back, and I will build again the tabernacle of David, that is fallen down, and its ruins I will build again, and will set it upright—</verse>
  <verse number="17">that the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and all the nations, upon whom My name hath been called, saith the Lord, who is doing all these things.</verse>
  <verse number="18">‘Known from the ages to God are all His works;</verse>
  <verse number="19">wherefore I judge: not to trouble those who from the nations do turn back to God,</verse>
  <verse number="20">but to write to them to abstain from the pollutions of the idols, and the whoredom, and the strangled thing; and the blood;</verse>
  <verse number="21">for Moses from former generations in every city hath those preaching him—in the synagogues every sabbath being read.’</verse>
  <verse number="22">Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole assembly, chosen men out of themselves to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas—Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren—</verse>
  <verse number="23">having written through their hand thus: ‘The apostles, and the elders, and the brethren, to those in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, brethren, who are of the nations, greeting;</verse>
  <verse number="24">seeing we have heard that certain having gone forth from us did trouble you with words, subverting your souls, saying to be circumcised and to keep the law, to whom we did give no charge,</verse>
  <verse number="25">it seemed good to us, having come together with one accord, chosen men to send unto you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul—</verse>
  <verse number="26">men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ—</verse>
  <verse number="27">we have sent, therefore, Judas and Silas, and they by word are telling the same things.</verse>
  <verse number="28">‘For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, no more burden to lay upon you, except these necessary things:</verse>
  <verse number="29">to abstain from things offered to idols, and blood, and a strangled thing, and whoredom; from which keeping yourselves, ye shall do well; be strong!’</verse>
  <verse number="30">They then, indeed, having been let go, went to Antioch, and having brought the multitude together, did deliver the epistle,</verse>
  <verse number="31">and they having read, did rejoice for the consolation;</verse>
  <verse number="32">Judas also and Silas, being themselves also prophets, through much discourse did exhort the brethren, and confirm,</verse>
  <verse number="33">and having passed some time, they were let go with peace from the brethren unto the apostles;</verse>
  <verse number="34">and it seemed good to Silas to remain there still.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and proclaiming good news—with many others also—the word of the Lord;</verse>
  <verse number="36">and after certain days, Paul said unto Barnabas, ‘Having turned back again, we may look after our brethren, in every city in which we have preached the word of the Lord—how they are.’</verse>
  <verse number="37">And Barnabas counselled to take with them John called Mark,</verse>
  <verse number="38">and Paul was not thinking it good to take him with them who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and did not go with them to the work;</verse>
  <verse number="39">there came, therefore, a sharp contention, so that they were parted from one another, and Barnabas having taken Mark, did sail to Cyprus,</verse>
  <verse number="40">and Paul having chosen Silas, went forth, having been given up to the grace of God by the brethren;</verse>
  <verse number="41">and he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the assemblies.</verse>
