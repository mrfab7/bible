<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A wise son is instructed of his father; But a scorner heareth not rebuke.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A man shall eat good from the fruit of his mouth; But the desire of the faithless is violence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He that guardeth his mouth keepeth his life; But for him that openeth wide his lips there shall be ruin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing; But the soul of the diligent shall be abundantly gratified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A righteous man hateth lying; But a wicked man behaveth vilely and shamefully.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Righteousness guardeth him that is upright in the way; But wickedness overthroweth the sinner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">There is that pretendeth himself rich, yet hath nothing; There is that pretendeth himself poor, yet hath great wealth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The ransom of a man’s life are his riches; But the poor heareth no threatening.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The light of the righteous rejoiceth; But the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">By pride cometh only contention; But with the well-advised is wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished; But he that gathereth little by little shall increase.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Hope deferred maketh the heart sick; But desire fulfilled is a tree of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whoso despiseth the word shall suffer thereby; But he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The teaching of the wise is a fountain of life, To depart from the snares of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Good understanding giveth grace; But the way of the faithless is harsh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Every prudent man dealeth with forethought; But a fool unfoldeth folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A wicked messenger falleth into evil; But a faithful ambassador is health.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction; But he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul; And it is an abomination to fools to depart from evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He that walketh with wise men shall be wise; But the companion of fools shall smart for it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Evil pursueth sinners; But to the righteous good shall be repaid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children’s children; And the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Much food is in the tillage of the poor; But there is that is swept away by want of righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He that spareth his rod hateth his son; But he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his desire; But the belly of the wicked shall want.</p>
