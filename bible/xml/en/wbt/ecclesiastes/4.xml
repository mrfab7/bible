<chapter book="Ecclesiastes" number="4" translation="Webster Bible Translation" translationID="wbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Wherefore I praised the dead who are already dead more than the living who are yet alive.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Yes, better is he than both they, who hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Again, I considered all labor, and every right work, that for this a man is envied by his neighbor. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Better is a handful with quietness, than both the hands full with toil and vexation of spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.</verse>
  <verse number="8">There is one alone, and there is not a second; yes, he hath neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his labor; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labor, and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity, yes, it is a grievous labor.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labor.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to help him to rise.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone?</verse>
  <verse number="12">And if one prevaileth against him, two shall withstand him; and a three-fold cord is not quickly broken.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Better is a poor and a wise child, than an old and foolish king, who will no more be admonished.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is born in his kingdom becometh poor.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I considered all the living who walk under the sun, with the second child that shall stand up in his stead.</verse>
  <verse number="16">There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
