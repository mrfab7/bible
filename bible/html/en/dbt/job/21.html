<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="21" data-translation="Darby Bible Translation" data-translation-id="dbt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear attentively my speech, and let this replace your consolations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Suffer me and I will speak; and after I have spoken, mock on!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">As for me, is my complaint to a man? or wherefore should not my spirit be impatient?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Mark me, and be astonished, and lay the hand upon the mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Even when I think [thereon], I am affrighted, and trembling taketh hold of my flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wherefore do the wicked live, grow old, yea, become mighty in power?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Their seed is established with them in their sight, and their offspring before their eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of +God upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They shout to the tambour and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the pipe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They spend their days in prosperity, and in a moment go down to Sheol.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And they say unto God, Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">What is the Almighty that we should serve him? and what are we profited if we pray unto him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand. The counsel of the wicked be far from me!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">How often is the lamp of the wicked put out, and cometh their calamity upon them? Doth he distribute sorrows [to them] in his anger?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Do they become as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">+God layeth up [the punishment of] his iniquity for his children; he rewardeth him, and he shall know [it]:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the fury of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For what pleasure should he have in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Can any teach God knowledge? And he it is that judgeth those that are high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">His sides are full of fat, and the marrow of his bones is moistened;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And another dieth in bitterness of soul, and hath not tasted good:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Together they lie down in the dust, and the worms cover them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Lo, I know your thoughts, and the devices ye wrongfully imagine against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For ye say, Where is the house of the noble? and where the tent of the dwellings of the wicked?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Have ye not asked the wayfarers? and do ye not regard their tokens:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">That the wicked is reserved for the day of calamity? They are led forth to the day of wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Yet is he carried to the graves, and watch is kept over the tomb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The clods of the valley are sweet unto him; and every man followeth suit after him, as there were innumerable before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">How then comfort ye me in vain? Your answers remain perfidious.</p>
