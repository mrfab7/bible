<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by God’s will, to the saints and faithful in Christ Jesus who are at Ephesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and [the] Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">according as he has chosen us in him before [the] world’s foundation, that we should be holy and blameless before him in love;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">having marked us out beforehand for adoption through Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">to [the] praise of [the] glory of his grace, wherein he has taken us into favour in the Beloved:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of offences, according to the riches of his grace;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">which he has caused to abound towards us in all wisdom and intelligence,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">for [the] administration of the fulness of times; to head up all things in the Christ, the things in the heavens and the things upon the earth; in him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">in whom we have also obtained an inheritance, being marked out beforehand according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his own will,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">that we should be to [the] praise of his glory who have pre-trusted in the Christ:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">in whom ye also [have trusted], having heard the word of the truth, the glad tidings of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, ye have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">who is [the] earnest of our inheritance to the redemption of the acquired possession to [the] praise of his glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Wherefore I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which [is] in you, and the love which [ye have] towards all the saints,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">do not cease giving thanks for you, making mention [of you] at my prayers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, would give you [the] spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">being enlightened in the eyes of your heart, so that ye should know what is the hope of his calling, [and] what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and what the surpassing greatness of his power towards us who believe, according to the working of the might of his strength,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">[in] which he wrought in the Christ [in] raising him from among [the] dead, and he set him down at his right hand in the heavenlies,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">above every principality, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name named, not only in this age, but also in that to come;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">and has put all things under his feet, and gave him [to be] head over all things to the assembly,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">which is his body, the fulness of him who fills all in all:</p>
