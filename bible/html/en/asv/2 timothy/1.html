<div class="chapter" data-book="2 Timothy" data-chapter="1" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">to Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers in a pure conscience, how unceasing is my remembrance of thee in my supplications, night and day</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">longing to see thee, remembering thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">having been reminded of the unfeigned faith that is in thee; which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and, I am persuaded, in thee also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For which cause I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee through the laying on of my hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For God gave us not a spirit of fearfulness; but of power and love and discipline.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Be not ashamed therefore of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but suffer hardship with the gospel according to the power of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">who saved us, and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before times eternal,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">but hath now been manifested by the appearing of our Saviour Christ Jesus, who abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">whereunto I was appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For which cause I suffer also these things: yet I am not ashamed; for I know him whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to guard that which I have committed unto him against that day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hold the pattern of sound words which thou hast heard from me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">That good thing which was committed unto thee guard through the Holy Spirit which dwelleth in us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">This thou knowest, that all that are in Asia turned away from me; of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The Lord grant mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">but, when he was in Rome, he sought me diligently, and found me</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">(the Lord grant unto him to find mercy of the Lord in that day); and in how many things he ministered at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.</p>
