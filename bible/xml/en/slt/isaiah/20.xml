  <verse number="1">In the year Tartan came to Ashdod, (in Sargon’s sending him, king of Assur) and he will fight with Ashdod and take it:</verse>
  <verse number="2">In that time spake Jehovah by the hand of Isaiah, son of Amos, saying, Go loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and thou shalt draw off the shoe from thy foot And he will do so, going naked and barefoot.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Jehovah will say, As my servant Isaiah went naked and barefoot three years, a sign and miracle upon Egypt and upon Cush:</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thus shall the king of Assur lead the captivity of Egypt, and the exile of Cush, boys and old men naked and barefoot, and buttocks uncovered, the nakedness of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And they were dismayed and ashamed of Cush their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he inhabiting this island said in that day, Behold, thus our expectation, where we fled there for help to be delivered from the face of the king of Assur: and how shall we escape?</verse>
