  <verse number="1">The wicked have fled and there is no pursuer. And the righteous as a young lion is confident.</verse>
  <verse number="2">By the transgression of a land many are its heads. And by an intelligent man, Who knoweth right—it is prolonged.</verse>
  <verse number="3">A man—poor and oppressing the weak, Is a sweeping rain, and there is no bread.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Those forsaking the law praise the wicked, Those keeping the law plead against them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Evil men understand not judgment, And those seeking Jehovah understand all.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Better is the poor walking in his integrity, Than the perverse of ways who is rich.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Whoso is keeping the law is an intelligent son, And a friend of gluttons, Doth cause his father to blush.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Whoso is multiplying his wealth by biting and usury, For one favouring the poor doth gather it.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Whoso is turning his ear from hearing the law, Even his prayer is an abomination.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Whoso is causing the upright to err in an evil way, Into his own pit he doth fall, And the perfect do inherit good.</verse>
  <verse number="11">A rich man is wise in his own eyes, And the intelligent poor searcheth him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">In the exulting of the righteous the glory is abundant, And in the rising of the wicked man is apprehensive.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Whoso is covering his transgressions prospereth not, And he who is confessing and forsaking hath mercy.</verse>
  <verse number="14">O the happiness of a man fearing continually, And whoso is hardening his heart falleth into evil.</verse>
  <verse number="15">A growling lion, and a ranging bear, Is the wicked ruler over a poor people.</verse>
  <verse number="16">A leader lacking understanding multiplieth oppressions, Whoso is hating dishonest gain prolongeth days.</verse>
  <verse number="17">A man oppressed with the blood of a soul, Unto the pit fleeth, none taketh hold on him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Whoso is walking uprightly is saved, And the perverted of ways falleth at once.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Whoso is tilling his ground is satisfied with bread, And whoso is pursuing vanity, Is filled with poverty.</verse>
  <verse number="20">A stedfast man hath multiplied blessings, And whoso is hasting to be rich is not acquitted.</verse>
  <verse number="21">To discern faces is not good, And for a piece of bread doth a man transgress.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Troubled for wealth is the man with an evil eye, And he knoweth not that want doth meet him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Whoso is reproving a man afterwards findeth grace, More than a flatterer with the tongue.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Whoso is robbing his father, or his mother, And is saying, ‘It is not transgression,’ A companion he is to a destroyer.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Whoso is proud in soul stirreth up contention, And whoso is trusting on Jehovah is made fat.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Whoso is trusting in his heart is a fool, And whoso is walking in wisdom is delivered.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Whoso is giving to the poor hath no lack, And whoso is hiding his eyes multiplied curses.</verse>
  <verse number="28">In the rising of the wicked a man is hidden, And in their destruction the righteous multiply!</verse>
