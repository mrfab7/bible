<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Say unto wisdom, Thou [art] my sister; and call understanding [thy] kinswoman:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger [which] flattereth with her words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And, behold, there met him a woman [with] the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">(She [is] loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now [is she] without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">So she caught him, and kissed him, [and] with an impudent face said unto him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">[I have] peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved [works], with fine linen of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For the goodman [is] not at home, he is gone a long journey:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He hath taken a bag of money with him, [and] will come home at the day appointed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it [is] for his life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong [men] have been slain by her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Her house [is] the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.</p>
