<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And calling His twelve disciples to Him, Jesus gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they could drive them out and heal every disease and sickness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">These are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon, called Peter, and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">These twelve Jesus sent out with the following instructions: “Do not go onto the road of the Gentiles or enter any town of the Samaritans.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Go rather to the lost sheep of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">As you go, preach this message: ‘The kingdom of heaven is near.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, drive out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Do not take along any gold or silver or copper in your belts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Take no bag for the road, or second tunic, or sandals, or staff; for the worker is worthy of his provisions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy there and stay at his house until you move on.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">As you enter the home, greet its occupants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If the home is worthy, let your peace rest on it, but if it is not, let your peace return to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And if anyone will not welcome you or heed your words, shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Truly I tell you, it will be more bearable for Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Behold, I am sending you out like sheep among wolves; therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But beware of men, for they will hand you over to their councils and flog you in their synagogues.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">On My account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the Gentiles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But when they hand you over, do not worry about how to respond or what to say. In that hour you will be given what to say.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For it will not be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; children will rise against their parents and have them put to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">You will be hated by everyone because of My name, but the one who perseveres to the end will be saved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next. Truly I tell you, you will not reach all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">It is enough for a disciple to be like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If the head of the house has been called Beelzebul, how much more the members of his household!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">So do not be afraid of them. For there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">What I tell you in the dark, speak in the daylight; what is whispered in your ear, proclaim from the housetops.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Instead, fear the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">So do not be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Therefore everyone who confesses Me before men, I will also confess him before My Father in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">But whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny him before My Father in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Do not assume that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">For I have come to turn ‘a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">A man’s enemies will be the members of his own household.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Anyone who loves his father or mother more than Me is not worthy of Me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of Me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">and anyone who does not take up his cross and follow Me is not worthy of Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for My sake will find it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives the One who sent Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Whoever receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward, and whoever receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous man’s reward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is My disciple, truly I tell you, he will never lose his reward.”</p>
