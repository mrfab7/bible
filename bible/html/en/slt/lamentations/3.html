<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I the man seeing affliction by the rod of his wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">He led me and he brought darkness and not light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Surely he will turn back against me; he will turn his hand all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He wasted away my flesh and my skin; he broke my bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He built against me, and he will surround with poison and distress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He caused me to dwell in darknesses as the dead of old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He walled about me and I shall not go forth: he loaded my brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Also when I shall exclaim and cry out, he stopped my prayer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He walled up my ways with hewn stones, he made crooked my beaten paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He is to me a bear lying in wait, a lion in secret places.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He turned aside my ways and he will tear me in pieces: he set me a desolation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He bent his bow, he will set me up as a mark for the arrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He brought the sons of his quiver into my reins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I was a derision to all my people; their song all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He filled me with bitternesses, he gave me wormwood to drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He will break my teeth with gravel stones, he covered me with ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Thou wilt cast of my soul from peace: I forgat good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And saying, My glory perished, and my hope from Jehovah:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Remembering my affliction and my bitterness, the wormwood and the poison.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Remembering, my soul will remember, and will be bowed down upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">I will turn this back to my heart; for this I shall hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The mercies of Jehovah are that we were not consumed, for his compassions were not finished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">New for the mornings: great thy faithfulness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Jehovah my portion, said my soul; for this I will hope toward him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Good Jehovah to those waiting for him, to the soul that will seek him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Good, and he shall wait and stand still for the salvation of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Good for a man that he shall lift up the yoke in his youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He will sit alone and be silent, for he laid upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He will give his mouth in the dust, if perhaps there is hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He will give the cheek to him striking him: he will be filled with reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For Jehovah will not cast of forever:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For if he afflicted, and he compassionated according to the multitude of his mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">For he afflicted not from his heart and grieved the sons of men,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">To crush under his feet all the bound of the earth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">To turn aside the judgment of a man before the face of the Most High.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">To pervert a man in his contention Jehovah saw not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Who this saying, And it shall be Jehovah commanding not?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">From the mouth of the Most High shall not come forth evil and good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Why shall a living man murmur? a man for his sin?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">We will search out our ways, and examine and turn back even to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">We will lift up our hearts upon the hands to God in the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">We transgressed and resisted: thou forgavest not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">Thou didst cover with anger, and thou wilt pursue us: thou didst slay, thou didst not pity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">Thou didst cover over thyself with a cloud from a prayer passing through.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Thou didst set us the offscouring and despising in the midst of peoples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">All our enemies opened their mouth against us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">Fear and a snare were to us, desolation and breaking.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">Mine eye will bring down streams of water for the breaking of the daughter of my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">Mine eye flowed and it will not be silent, from no intermission,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">Till Jehovah shall look forth and see from the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">Mine eye will glean for my soul for all the daughters of my city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">Hunting, they hunted me as a bird, mine enemies, gratuitously.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">They cut off my life in the pit, and cast a stone upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">Waters were spread over my head; I said I was cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">I called thy name, O Jehovah, in the pit underneath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">Thou heardest my voice: thou wilt not hide thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="57">Thou drewest near in the day I shall call thee: thou saidst, Thou shalt not fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="58">Thou didst contend, O Jehovah, the contentions of my soul; thou didst redeem my life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="59">Thou sawest, O Jehovah, my bowing down: judge thou my judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="60">Thou sawest all their vengeance, all their purposes against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="61">Thou heardest their reproach, O Jehovah, all their purposes against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="62">The lips of those rising up, and their devices against me all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="63">Their sitting and their rising, look thou: I their song.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="64">Thou wilt turn back to them a retribution, O Jehovah, according to the work of their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="65">Thou wilt give to them a covering of heart, thy curse to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="66">Thou wilt pursue in thine anger, and thou wilt destroy them from under the heavens, O Jehovah.</p>
