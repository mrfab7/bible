<chapter book="Ecclesiastes" number="11" translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" translationID="jps" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Cast thy bread upon the waters, For thou shalt find it after many days.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Divide a portion into seven, yea, even into eight; For thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">If the clouds be full of rain, They empty themselves upon the earth; And if a tree fall in the south, or in the north, In the place where the tree falleth, there shall it be.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He that observeth the wind shall not sow; And he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.</verse>
  <verse number="5">As thou knowest not what is the way of the wind, Nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child; Even so thou knowest not the work of God Who doeth all things.</verse>
  <verse number="6">In the morning sow thy seed, And in the evening withhold not thy hand; For thou knowest not which shall prosper, whether this or that, Or whether they both shall be alike good.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the light is sweet, And a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For if a man live many years, Let him rejoice in them all, And remember the days of darkness, For they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; And let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, And walk in the ways of thy heart, And in the sight of thine eyes; But know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore remove vexation from thy heart, And put away evil from thy flesh; For childhood and youth are vanity.</verse>
