<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, even by reason of my haste that is in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame, and the spirit of my understanding answereth me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Knowest thou not this of old time, since man was placed upon earth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless but for a moment?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The eye which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">His children shall seek the favour of the poor, and his hands shall give back his wealth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">His bones are full of his youth, but it shall lie down with him in the dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Though he spare it, and will not let it go, but keep it still within his mouth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He shall suck the poison of asps: the viperâ€™s tongue shall slay him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He shall not look upon the rivers, the flowing streams of honey and butter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down; according to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor; he hath violently taken away an house, and he shall not build it up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Because he knew no quietness within him, he shall not save aught of that wherein he delighteth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">There was nothing left that he devoured not; therefore his prosperity shall not endure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: the hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fierceness of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of brass shall strike him through.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body: yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall; terrors are upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">All darkness is laid up for his treasures: a fire not blown by man shall devour him; it shall consume that which is left in his tent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The increase of his house shall depart, his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.</p>
