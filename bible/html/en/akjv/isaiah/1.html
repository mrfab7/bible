<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="1" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The ox knows his owner, and the ass his masterâ€™s crib: but Israel does not know, my people does not consider.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel to anger, they are gone away backward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Why should you be stricken any more? you will revolt more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Except the LORD of hosts had left to us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When you come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand, to tread my courts?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination to me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates: they are a trouble to me; I am weary to bear them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And when you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you: yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Come now, and let us reason together, said the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If you be willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the LORD has spoken it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Your silver is become dross, your wine mixed with water:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loves gifts, and follows after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Therefore said the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries, and avenge me of my enemies:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And I will turn my hand on you, and purely purge away your dross, and take away all your tin:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counsellors as at the beginning: afterward you shall be called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden that has no water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And the strong shall be as wick, and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.</p>
