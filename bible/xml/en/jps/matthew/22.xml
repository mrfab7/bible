  <verse number="1">Again Jesus spoke to them in figurative language.</verse>
  <verse number="2">“The Kingdom of the Heavens,” He said, “may be compared to a king who celebrated the marriage of his son,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and sent his servants to call the invited guests to the wedding, but they were unwilling to come.</verse>
  <verse number="4">“Again he sent other servants with a message to those who were invited. “’My breakfast is now ready,” he said, ‘my bullocks and fat cattle are killed, and every preparation is made: come to the wedding.’</verse>
  <verse number="5">“They however gave no heed, but went, one to his home in the country, another to his business;</verse>
  <verse number="6">and the rest seized the king’s servants, maltreated them, and murdered them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">So the king’s anger was stirred, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burnt their city.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then he said to his servants, “’The wedding banquet is ready, but those who were invited were unworthy of it.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Go out therefore to the crossroads, and everybody you meet invite to the wedding.’</verse>
  <verse number="10">“So they went out into the roads and gathered together all they could find, both bad and good, and the banqueting hall was filled with guests.</verse>
  <verse number="11">“Now the king came in to see the guests; and among them he discovered one who was not wearing a wedding-robe.</verse>
  <verse number="12">“’My friend,’ he said, ‘how is it that you came in here without a wedding robe?’</verse>
  <verse number="13">“The man stood speechless. Then the king said to the servants, “’Bind him hand and foot and fling him into the darkness outside: there will be the weeping aloud and the gnashing of teeth.’</verse>
  <verse number="14">“For there are many called, but few chosen.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then the Pharisees went and consulted together how they might entrap Him in His conversation.</verse>
  <verse number="16">So they sent to Him their disciples together with the Herodians; who said, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and that you faithfully teach God’s truth; and that no fear of man misleads you, for you are not biased by men’s wealth or rank.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Give us your judgement therefore: is it allowable for us to pay a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?”</verse>
  <verse number="18">Perceiving their wickedness, Jesus replied, “Why are you hypocrites trying to ensnare me?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Show me the tribute coin.” And they brought Him a shilling.</verse>
  <verse number="20">“Whose likeness and inscription,” He asked, “is this?”</verse>
  <verse number="21">“Caesar’s,” they replied. “Pay therefore,” He rejoined, “what is Caesar’s to Caesar; and what is God’s to God.”</verse>
  <verse number="22">They heard this, and were astonished; then left Him, and went their way.</verse>
  <verse number="23">On the same day a party of Sadducees came to Him, contending that there is no resurrection. And they put this case to Him.</verse>
  <verse number="24">“Teacher,” they said, “Moses enjoined, ‘If a man die childless, his brother shall marry his widow, and raise up a family for him.’</verse>
  <verse number="25">Now we had among us seven brothers. The eldest of them married, but died childless, leaving his wife to his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="26">So also did the second and the third, down to the seventh,</verse>
  <verse number="27">till the woman also died, after surviving them all.</verse>
  <verse number="28">At the Resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? for they all married her.”</verse>
  <verse number="29">The reply of Jesus was, “You are in error, through ignorance of the Scriptures and of the power of God.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For in the Resurrection, men neither marry nor are women given in marriage, but they are like angels in Heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="31">But as to the Resurrection of the dead, have you never read what God says to you,</verse>
  <verse number="32">I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of dead, but of living men.”</verse>
  <verse number="33">All the crowd heard this, and were filled with amazement at His teaching.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Now the Pharisees came up when they heard that He had silenced the Sadducees,</verse>
  <verse number="35">and one of them, an expounder of the Law, asked Him as a test question,</verse>
  <verse number="36">“Teacher, which is the greatest Commandment in the Law?”</verse>
  <verse number="37">“’Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,’” He answered, “’with thy whole heart, thy whole soul, thy whole mind.’</verse>
  <verse number="38">This is the greatest and foremost Commandment.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And the second is similar to it: ‘Thou shalt love thy fellow man as much as thyself.’</verse>
  <verse number="40">The whole of the Law and the Prophets is summed up in these two Commandments.”</verse>
  <verse number="41">While the Pharisees were still assembled there, Jesus put a question to them.</verse>
  <verse number="42">“What think you about the Christ,” He said, “whose son is He?” “David’s,” they replied.</verse>
  <verse number="43">“How then,” He asked, “does David, taught by the Spirit, call Him Lord, when he says,</verse>
  <verse number="44">“’The Lord said to my Lord, sit at My right hand until I have put thy foes beneath thy feet’?</verse>
  <verse number="45">“If therefore David calls Him Lord, how can He be his son?”</verse>
  <verse number="46">No one could say a word in reply, nor from that day did any one venture again to put a question to Him.</verse>
