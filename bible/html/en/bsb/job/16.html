<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">â€œI have heard many things like these; miserable comforters are you all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is there no end to your long-winded speeches? What provokes you to continue testifying?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I could also speak like you if you were in my place; I could heap up words against you and shake my head at you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But I would encourage you with my mouth, and the consolation of my lips would bring relief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Even if I speak, my pain is not relieved, and if I hold back, how will it go away?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Surely He has now exhausted me; You have devastated all my family.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">You have bound me, and it has become a witness; my frailty rises up and testifies against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">His anger has torn me and opposed me; He gnashes His teeth at me. My adversary pierces me with His eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They open their mouths against me and strike my cheeks with contempt; they join together against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">God has delivered me to unjust men; He has thrown me to the clutches of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I was at ease, but He shattered me; He seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has set me up as His target;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">His archers surround me. He pierces my kidneys without mercy and spills my gall on the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He breaks me with wound upon wound; He rushes me like a mighty warrior.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I have sewn sackcloth over my skin; I have buried my horn in the dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">My face is red with weeping, and deep shadows ring my eyes;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">yet my hands are free of violence and my prayer is pure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">O earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry for help never be laid to rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Even now my witness is in heaven, and my advocate is on high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My friends are my scoffers as my eyes pour out tears to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Oh, that a man might plead with God as he pleads with his neighbor!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For when only a few years are past I will go the way of no return.</p>
