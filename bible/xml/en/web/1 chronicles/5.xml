  <verse number="1">The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel (for he was the firstborn; but, because he defiled his father’s couch, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel; and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For Judah prevailed above his brothers, and of him came the prince; but the birthright was Joseph’s:)</verse>

  <verse number="7">His brothers by their families, when the genealogy of their generations was reckoned: the chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who lived in Aroer, even to Nebo and Baal Meon:</verse>
  <verse number="9">and eastward he lived even to the entrance of the wilderness from the river Euphrates, because their livestock were multiplied in the land of Gilead.</verse>

  <verse number="11">The sons of Gad lived over against them, in the land of Bashan to Salecah:</verse>
  <verse number="12">Joel the chief, and Shapham the second, and Janai, and Shaphat in Bashan.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Their brothers of their fathers’ houses: Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jacan, and Zia, and Eber, seven.</verse>

  <verse number="18">The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and to shoot with bow, and skillful in war, were forty-four thousand seven hundred and sixty, that were able to go forth to war.</verse>
  <verse number="19">They made war with the Hagrites, with Jetur, and Naphish, and Nodab.</verse>
  <verse number="20">They were helped against them, and the Hagrites were delivered into their hand, and all who were with them; for they cried to God in the battle, and he was entreated of them, because they put their trust in him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">They took away their livestock; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred fifty thousand, and of donkeys two thousand, and of men one hundred thousand.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For there fell many slain, because the war was of God. They lived in their place until the captivity.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The children of the half-tribe of Manasseh lived in the land: they increased from Bashan to Baal Hermon and Senir and Mount Hermon.</verse>
  <verse number="24">These were the heads of their fathers’ houses: even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valor, famous men, heads of their fathers’ houses.</verse>
