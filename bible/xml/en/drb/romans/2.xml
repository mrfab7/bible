  <verse number="1">WHEREFORE thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest. For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself. For thou dost the same things which thou judgest.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For we know that the judgment of God is, according to truth, against them that do such things.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such things, and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and patience, and longsuffering? Knowest thou not, that the benignity of God leadeth thee to penance?</verse>
  <verse number="5">But according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up to thyself wrath, against the day of wrath, and revelation of the just judgment of God.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Who will render to every man according to his works.</verse>
  <verse number="7">To them indeed, who according to patience in good work, seek glory and honour and incorruption, eternal life:</verse>
  <verse number="8">But to them that are contentious, and who obey not the truth, but give credit to iniquity, wrath and indignation.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But glory, and honour, and peace to every one that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For there is no respect of persons with God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For whosoever have sinned without the law, shall perish without the law; and whosoever have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature those things that are of the law; these having not the law are a law to themselves:</verse>
  <verse number="15">Who shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to them, and their thoughts between themselves accusing, or also defending one another,</verse>
  <verse number="16">In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But if thou art called a Jew and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</verse>
  <verse number="18">And knowest his will, and approvest the more profitable things, being instructed by the law,</verse>
  <verse number="19">Art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,</verse>
  <verse number="20">An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Thou therefore that teachest another, teachest not thyself: thou that preachest that men should not steal, stealest:</verse>
  <verse number="22">Thou that sayest, men should not commit adultery, committest adultery: thou that abhorrest idols, committest sacrilege:</verse>
  <verse number="23">Thou that makest thy boast of the law, by transgression of the law dishonourest God.</verse>
  <verse number="24">(For the name of God through you is blasphemed among the Gentiles, as it is written.)</verse>
  <verse number="25">Circumcision profiteth indeed, if thou keep the law; but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</verse>
  <verse number="26">If, then, the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law, shall not this uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</verse>
  <verse number="27">And shall not that which by nature is uncircumcision, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?</verse>
  <verse number="28">For it is not he is a Jew, who is so outwardly; nor is that circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh:</verse>
  <verse number="29">But he is a Jew, that is one inwardly; and the circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</verse>
