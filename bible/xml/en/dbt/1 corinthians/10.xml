<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="10" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;</verse>
  <verse number="2">and all were baptised unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and all ate the same spiritual food,</verse>
  <verse number="4">and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank of a spiritual rock which followed [them]: (now the rock was the Christ;)</verse>
  <verse number="5">yet God was not pleased with the most of them, for they were strewed in the desert.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But these things happened [as] types of us, that we should not be lusters after evil things, as they also lusted.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Neither be ye idolaters, as some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Neither let us tempt the Christ, as some of them tempted, and perished by serpents.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Now all these things happened to them [as] types, and have been written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come.</verse>
  <verse number="12">So that let him that thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall.</verse>
  <verse number="13">No temptation has taken you but such as is according to man’s nature; and God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able [to bear], but will with the temptation make the issue also, so that [ye] should be able to bear [it].</verse>
  <verse number="14">Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I speak as to intelligent [persons]: do ye judge what I say.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not [the] communion of the blood of the Christ? The bread which we break, is it not [the] communion of the body of the Christ?</verse>
  <verse number="17">Because we, [being] many, are one loaf, one body; for we all partake of that one loaf.</verse>
  <verse number="18">See Israel according to flesh: are not they who eat the sacrifices in communion with the altar?</verse>
  <verse number="19">What then do I say? that what is sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything?</verse>
  <verse number="20">But that what [the nations] sacrifice they sacrifice to demons, and not to God. Now I do not wish you to be in communion with demons.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Ye cannot drink [the] Lord’s cup, and [the] cup of demons: ye cannot partake of [the] Lord’s table, and of [the] table of demons.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?</verse>
  <verse number="23">All things are lawful, but all are not profitable; all things are lawful, but all do not edify.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Let no one seek his own [advantage], but that of the other.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Everything sold in the shambles eat, making no inquiry for conscience sake.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For the earth [is] the Lord’s and its fulness.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But if any one of the unbelievers invite you, and ye are minded to go, all that is set before you eat, making no inquiry for conscience sake.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But if any one say to you, This is offered to holy purposes, do not eat, for his sake that pointed it out, and conscience sake;</verse>
  <verse number="29">but conscience, I mean, not thine own, but that of the other: for why is my liberty judged by another conscience?</verse>
  <verse number="30">If I partake with thanksgiving, why am I spoken evil of for what I give thanks for?</verse>
  <verse number="31">Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatever ye do, do all things to God’s glory.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Give no occasion to stumbling, whether to Jews, or Greeks, or the assembly of God.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Even as I also please all in all things; not seeking my own profit, but that of the many, that they may be saved.</verse>
