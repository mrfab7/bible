<chapter book="Philippians" number="4" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Wherefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Yea, I beseech thee also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Rejoice in the Lord alway: again I will say, Rejoice.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Let your forbearance be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.</verse>
  <verse number="6">In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honourable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The things which ye both learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do: and the God of peace shall be with you.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye have revived your thought for me; wherein ye did indeed take thought, but ye lacked opportunity.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound: in everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.</verse>
  <verse number="13">I can do all things in him that strengtheneth me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Howbeit ye did well, that ye had fellowship with my affliction.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving, but ye only;</verse>
  <verse number="16">for even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my need.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things that came from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And my God shall fulfill every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Now unto our God and Father be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren which are with me salute you.</verse>
  <verse number="22">All the saints salute you, especially they that are of Caesar’s household.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.</verse>
