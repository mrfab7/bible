<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Behold, thou [art] fair, my love; behold, thou [art] fair; thou [hast] doves’ eyes within thy locks: thy hair [is] as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thy teeth [are] like a flock [of sheep that are even] shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none [is] barren among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thy lips [are] like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech [is] comely: thy temples [are] like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thy neck [is] like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thy two breasts [are] like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thou [art] all fair, my love; [there is] no spot in thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Come with me from Lebanon, [my] spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions’ dens, from the mountains of the leopards.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, [my] spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">How fair is thy love, my sister, [my] spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Thy lips, O [my] spouse, drop [as] the honeycomb: honey and milk [are] under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments [is] like the smell of Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A garden inclosed [is] my sister, [my] spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Thy plants [are] an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, [that] the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.</p>
