  <verse number="1">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Command the children of Israel, and say to them, My offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet smell to me, shall you observe to offer to me in their due season.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And you shall say to them, This is the offering made by fire which you shall offer to the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The one lamb shall you offer in the morning, and the other lamb shall you offer at even;</verse>
  <verse number="5">And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil.</verse>
  <verse number="6">It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet smell, a sacrifice made by fire to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shall you cause the strong wine to be poured to the LORD for a drink offering.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the other lamb shall you offer at even: as the meat offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, you shall offer it, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:</verse>
  <verse number="10">This is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And in the beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt offering to the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot;</verse>
  <verse number="12">And three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram;</verse>
  <verse number="13">And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat offering to one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet smell, a sacrifice made by fire to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine to a bullock, and the third part of an hin to a ram, and a fourth part of an hin to a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And one kid of the goats for a sin offering to the LORD shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.</verse>
  <verse number="18">In the first day shall be an holy convocation; you shall do no manner of servile work therein:</verse>
  <verse number="19">But you shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering to the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they shall be to you without blemish:</verse>
  <verse number="20">And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil: three tenth deals shall you offer for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram;</verse>
  <verse number="21">A several tenth deal shall you offer for every lamb, throughout the seven lambs:</verse>
  <verse number="22">And one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.</verse>
  <verse number="23">You shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering.</verse>
  <verse number="24">After this manner you shall offer daily, throughout the seven days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD: it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And on the seventh day you shall have an holy convocation; you shall do no servile work.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Also in the day of the first fruits, when you bring a new meat offering to the LORD, after your weeks be out, you shall have an holy convocation; you shall do no servile work:</verse>
  <verse number="27">But you shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet smell to the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year;</verse>
  <verse number="28">And their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals to one bullock, two tenth deals to one ram,</verse>
  <verse number="29">A several tenth deal to one lamb, throughout the seven lambs;</verse>
  <verse number="30">And one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you.</verse>
  <verse number="31">You shall offer them beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, (they shall be to you without blemish) and their drink offerings.</verse>
