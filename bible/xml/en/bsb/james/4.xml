  <verse number="1">What causes conflicts and quarrels among you? Don’t they come from the passions at war within you?</verse>
  <verse number="2">You crave what you do not have; you kill and covet, but are unable to obtain it. You quarrel and fight. You do not have, because you do not ask.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And when you do ask, you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, that you may squander it on your pleasures.</verse>
  <verse number="4">You adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is hostility toward God? Therefore, whoever chooses to be a friend of the world renders himself an enemy of God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Or do you think the Scripture says without reason that the Spirit He caused to dwell in us yearns with envy?</verse>
  <verse number="6">But He gives us more grace. This is why it says: “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”</verse>
  <verse number="7">Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Grieve, mourn, and weep. Turn your laughter to mourning, and your joy to gloom.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will exalt you.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Brothers, do not slander one another. Anyone who speaks against his brother or judges him speaks against the law and judges it. And if you judge the law, you are not a practitioner of the law, but a judge of it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business, and make a profit.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">You do not even know what will happen tomorrow! What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Instead, you ought to say, “If the Lord is willing, we will live and do this or that.”</verse>
  <verse number="16">As it is, you boast in your proud intentions. All such boasting is evil.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Anyone, then, who knows the right thing to do, yet fails to do it, is guilty of sin.</verse>
