<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the war will be heavy upon Saul, and they shooting with bows will find him, and he will be wounded from those shooting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Saul will say to him lifting up his utensils, Draw thy sword and thrust me through with it lest these uncircumcised shall come and shall mock against me. And he lifting up his utensils would not, for he feared greatly. And Saul will take the sword and fall upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And he lifting up his utensils will see that Saul died, and he will also fall upon the sword and die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Saul will die, and his three sons, and all his house together died.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And all the men of Israel which are in the valley will see that they fled, and that Saul and his sons died, and they will forsake their cities and will flee: and the rovers will come and dwell in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And it will be from the morrow, and the rovers will come to strip the wounded, and they will find Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And they will strip him and lift up his head, and his weapons, and send into the land of the rovers round about, to announce the good news to their images and the people.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And all Jabesh-Gilead will hear all that the rovers did to Saul,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And they will rise, every man of strength, and they will lift up the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons, and they will bring them to Jabesh, and they will bury their bones under an oak in Jabesh, and they will fast seven days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Saul will die in his transgression which he transgressed against Jehovah, against the word of Jehovah, which he watched not, and also for asking to a sorcerer to seek out;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And not seeking to Jehovah: and he will kill him, and turn the kingdom to David the son of Jesse.</p>
