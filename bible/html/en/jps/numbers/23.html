<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Balaam said unto Balak: ‘Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Balaam said unto Balak: ‘Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will go; peradventure the LORD will come to meet me; and whatsoever He showeth me I will tell thee.’ And he went to a bare height.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And God met Balaam; and he said unto Him: ‘I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the LORD put a word in Balaam’s mouth, and said: ‘Return unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt-offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he took up his parable, and said: From Aram Balak bringeth me, The king of Moab from the mountains of the East: ‘Come, curse me Jacob, And come, execrate Israel.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? And how shall I execrate, whom the LORD hath not execrated?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For from the top of the rocks I see him, And from the hills I behold him: Lo, it is a people that shall dwell alone, And shall not be reckoned among the nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who hath counted the dust of Jacob, Or numbered the stock of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, And let mine end be like his!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Balak said unto Balaam: ‘What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And he answered and said: ‘Must I not take heed to speak that which the LORD putteth in my mouth?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Balak said unto him: ‘Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest see them; thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all; and curse me them from thence.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he said unto Balak: ‘Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I go toward a meeting yonder.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said: ‘Return unto Balak, and thus shalt thou speak.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he came to him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt-offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him: ‘What hath the LORD spoken?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he took up his parable, and said: Arise, Balak, and hear; Give ear unto me, thou son of Zippor:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">God is not a man, that He should lie; Neither the son of man, that He should repent: When He hath said, will He not do it? Or when He hath spoken, will He not make it good?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Behold, I am bidden to bless; And when He hath blessed, I cannot call it back.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">None hath beheld iniquity in Jacob, Neither hath one seen perverseness in Israel; The LORD his God is with him, And the shouting for the King is among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">God who brought them forth out of Egypt Is for them like the lofty horns of the wild-ox.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For there is no enchantment with Jacob, Neither is there any divination with Israel; Now is it said of Jacob and of Israel: ‘What hath God wrought!’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Behold a people that riseth up as a lioness, And as a lion doth he lift himself up; He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, And drink the blood of the slain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Balak said unto Balaam: ‘Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But Balaam answered and said unto Balak: ‘Told not I thee, saying: All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And Balak said unto Balaam: ‘Come now, I will take thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them from thence.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And Balak took Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh down upon the desert.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Balaam said unto Balak: ‘Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bullock and a ram on every altar.</p>
