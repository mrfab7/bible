<div class="chapter" data-book="Hebrews" data-chapter="13" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Let love of the brethren continue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Forget not to show love unto strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; them that are ill-treated, as being yourselves also in the body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Let marriage be had in honor among all, and let the bed be undefiled: for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Be ye free from the love of money; content with such things as ye have: for himself hath said, I will in no wise fail thee, neither will I in any wise forsake thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">So that with good courage we say, The Lord is my helper; I will not fear: What shall man do unto me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Remember them that had the rule over you, men that spake unto you the word of God; and considering the issue of their life, imitate their faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and to-day, (yea) and for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Be not carried away by divers and strange teachings: for it is good that the heart be established by grace; not by meats, wherein they that occupied themselves were not profited.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat that serve the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned without the camp.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered without the gate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Let us therefore go forth unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For we have not here an abiding city, but we seek after the city which is to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Through him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips which make confession to his name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit to them: for they watch in behalf of your souls, as they that shall give account; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief: for this were unprofitable for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Pray for us: for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honorably in all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And I exhort you the more exceedingly to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant, even our Lord Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">make you perfect in every good thing to do his will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But I exhort you, brethren, bear with the word of exhortation: for I have written unto you in few words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Know ye that our brother Timothy hath been set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>
