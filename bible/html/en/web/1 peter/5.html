<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Peter" data-chapter="5" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily, not for dishonest gain, but willingly;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">neither as lording it over those entrusted to you, but making yourselves examples to the flock.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">When the chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that doesn’t fade away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder. Yes, all of you clothe yourselves with humility, to subject yourselves to one another; for “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">casting all your worries on him, because he cares for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Be sober and self-controlled. Be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, walks around like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Withstand him steadfast in your faith, knowing that your brothers who are in the world are undergoing the same sufferings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But may the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while, perfect, establish, strengthen, and settle you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">To him be the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Through Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I consider him, I have written to you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">She who is in Babylon, chosen together with you, greets you; and so does Mark, my son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace be to you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
