<p class="verse" data-verse="1">For this reason, O man, each one of you who judges is inexcusable. For by that which you judge another, you condemn yourself. For you do the same things that you judge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For we know that the judgment of God is in accord with truth against those who do such things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But, O man, when you judge those who do such things as you yourself also do, do you think that you will escape the judgment of God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Or do you despise the riches of his goodness and patience and forbearance? Do you not know that the kindness of God is calling you to repentance?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But in accord with your hard and impenitent heart, you store up wrath for yourself, unto the day of wrath and of revelation by the just judgment of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For he will render to each one according to his works:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">To those who, in accord with patient good works, seek glory and honor and incorruption, certainly, he will render eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But to those who are contentious and who do not acquiesce to the truth, but instead trust in iniquity, he will render wrath and indignation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Tribulation and anguish are upon every soul of man that works evil: the Jew first, and also the Greek.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But glory and honor and peace are for all who do what is good: the Jew first, and also the Greek.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For there is no favoritism with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For whoever had sinned without the law, will perish without the law. And whoever had sinned in the law, will be judged by the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For it is not the hearers of the law who are just before God, but rather it is the doers of the law who shall be justified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For when the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature those things which are of the law, such persons, not having the law, are a law unto themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For they reveal the work of the law written in their hearts, while their conscience renders testimony about them, and their thoughts within themselves also accuse or even defend them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">unto the day when God shall judge the hidden things of men, through Jesus Christ, according to my Gospel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But if you are called by name a Jew, and you rest upon the law, and you find glory in God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">and you have known his will, and you demonstrate the more useful things, having been instructed by the law:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">you become confident within yourself that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">an instructor to the foolish, a teacher to children, because you have a type of knowledge and truth in the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">As a result, you teach others, but you do not teach yourself. You preach that men should not steal, but you yourself steal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">You speak against adultery, but you commit adultery. You abominate idols, but you commit sacrilege.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">You would glory in the law, but through a betrayal of the law you dishonor God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">(For because of you the name of God is being blasphemed among the Gentiles, just as it was written.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Certainly, circumcision is beneficial, if you observe the law. But if you are a betrayer of the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And so, if the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law, shall not this lack of circumcision be counted as circumcision?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And that which is by nature uncircumcised, if it fulfills the law, should it not judge you, who by the letter and by circumcision are a betrayer of the law?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For a Jew is not he who seems so outwardly. Neither is circumcision that which seems so outwardly, in the flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">But a Jew is he who is so inwardly. And circumcision of the heart is in the spirit, not in the letter. For its praise is not of men, but of God.</p>
