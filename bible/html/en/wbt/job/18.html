<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Why are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of its place?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">His strength shall be hunger-bitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the first-born of death shall devour his strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">They that come after him shall be astonished at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.</p>
