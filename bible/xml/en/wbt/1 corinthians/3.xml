<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="3" translation="Webster Bible Translation" translationID="wbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, even as to babes in Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</verse>
  <verse number="4">For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</verse>
  <verse number="6">I have planted, Apollos watered: but God hath given the increase.</verse>
  <verse number="7">So then, neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth: but God that giveth the increase.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labor.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For we are laborers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building.</verse>
  <verse number="10">According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master-builder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth upon it. But let every man take heed how he buildeth upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now if any man buildeth upon this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</verse>
  <verse number="13">Every man’s work will be made manifest: for the day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will try every man’s work, of what sort it is.</verse>
  <verse number="14">If any man’s work abideth which he hath built upon it, he shall receive a reward.</verse>
  <verse number="15">If any man’s work shall be burned, he will suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</verse>
  <verse number="17">If any man defileth the temple of God, him will God destroy: for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Therefore let no man glory in men: for all things are yours:</verse>
  <verse number="22">Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</verse>
  <verse number="23">And ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.</verse>
