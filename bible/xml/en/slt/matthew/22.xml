  <verse number="1">And Jesus, having answered, spake to them in parables, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man, a king, who made a nuptial feast for his son.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he sent his servants to those having been called to the nuptial feast: and they would not come.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And again, he sent other servants, saying, Say to the called: Behold, I have prepared my supper; my bulls and stall-fed killed, and all prepared: come to the nuptials.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And they, not having heeded, departed, one truly to his own field, and one to his traffic:</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the rest, having seized his servants, were insolent, and killed them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the king, having heard, was angry, and having sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then says he to his servants, Truly the nuptial feast is prepared, and those called were not worthy.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Go ye, therefore, to the passages of the ways, and as many as ye should find, call to the nuptial feast.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And those servants, having come to the ways, gathered together all, as many as they found, also both the evil and good, and the nuptial feast was filled with the reclining.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the king, having come in to behold the reclining, saw there a man not clad with the garment of the wedding:</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he says to him, Friend, how camest thou in here, not having a garment of the nuptial feast? And he was muzzled.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then said the king to his servants, Having bound his feet and hands, take him away, and cast ye him into outer darkness; weeping shall be there, and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For many are called, and few chosen.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then the Pharisees, having gone, took counsel how they might ensnare him in word.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they send to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, and care is to thee for none; for thou lookest not to the face of men.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Therefore say to us, What seems to thee Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</verse>
  <verse number="18">But Jesus, having known their evil, said, Why tempt ye me, hypocrites?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Show me the piece of money of tribute. And they brought him a drachma.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he says to them, Whose is this image and inscription?</verse>
  <verse number="21">They say to him, Caesar’s. Then says he to them, Give back then to Caesar the things of Caesar; and the things of God to God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And having heard, they wondered, and having left him, they departed.</verse>
  <verse number="23">In that day the Sadducees came to him, they saying there is to be no rising up: and they asked him,</verse>
  <verse number="24">Saying, Teacher, Moses said, If any one die, not having children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And with us were seven brethren: and the first, having married, died; and having no seed, he left his wife to his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And likewise the second, and third, even till the seven.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And after all died also the woman.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Therefore in the rising up whose of the seven shall the woman be? for they all had her.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Jesus, having answered, said to them, Ye are led astray, not having known the writings, nor the power of God.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For in the rising up they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the messengers of God in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And for the rising up of the dead, read ye not that spoken by God, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="32">I am God of Abraham, and God of Isaac, and God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And the crowds having heard, were astonished at his teaching.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And the Pharisees having heard that he muzzled the Sadducees, were gathered upon the same.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And one of them, skilled in the law, asked, tempting him, and saying,</verse>
  <verse number="36">Teacher, which the great command in the law?</verse>
  <verse number="37">And Jesus said to him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind.</verse>
  <verse number="38">This is the first and the great command.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And the second like it: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</verse>
  <verse number="40">In these two commands hang the whole law and the prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And the Pharisees having been gathered together, Jesus asked them,</verse>
  <verse number="42">Saying, What seems to you about Christ? Whose son is he They say to him, David’s.</verse>
  <verse number="43">He says to them, How then does David in spirit call him Lord, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="44">The Lord said to my Lord, Sit by my right, till I make thine enemies the footstool of my feet.</verse>
  <verse number="45">If, therefore, David calls him Lord, how is he his son.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And none could answer him a word, nor dared any one from that day to ask him any more.</verse>
