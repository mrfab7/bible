<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For if there come into your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say to him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment-seats?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Do they not blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">If ye fulfill the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For he that said, Do not commit adultery; said also, Do not kill. Now if thou committest no adultery, yet if thou killest, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For he shall have judgment without mercy that hath shown no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man sayeth he hath faith, and hath not works? can faith save him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If a brother or sister is naked, and destitute of daily food,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And one of you sayeth to them, Depart in peace, be you warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Also a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the demons also believe, and tremble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Ye see then that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</p>
