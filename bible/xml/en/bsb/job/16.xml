  <verse number="1">Then Job answered:</verse>
  <verse number="2">“I have heard many things like these; miserable comforters are you all.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Is there no end to your long-winded speeches? What provokes you to continue testifying?</verse>
  <verse number="4">I could also speak like you if you were in my place; I could heap up words against you and shake my head at you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But I would encourage you with my mouth, and the consolation of my lips would bring relief.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Even if I speak, my pain is not relieved, and if I hold back, how will it go away?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Surely He has now exhausted me; You have devastated all my family.</verse>
  <verse number="8">You have bound me, and it has become a witness; my frailty rises up and testifies against me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">His anger has torn me and opposed me; He gnashes His teeth at me. My adversary pierces me with His eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They open their mouths against me and strike my cheeks with contempt; they join together against me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">God has delivered me to unjust men; He has thrown me to the clutches of the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I was at ease, but He shattered me; He seized me by the neck and crushed me. He has set me up as His target;</verse>
  <verse number="13">His archers surround me. He pierces my kidneys without mercy and spills my gall on the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He breaks me with wound upon wound; He rushes me like a mighty warrior.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I have sewn sackcloth over my skin; I have buried my horn in the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="16">My face is red with weeping, and deep shadows ring my eyes;</verse>
  <verse number="17">yet my hands are free of violence and my prayer is pure.</verse>
  <verse number="18">O earth, do not cover my blood; may my cry for help never be laid to rest.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Even now my witness is in heaven, and my advocate is on high.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My friends are my scoffers as my eyes pour out tears to God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Oh, that a man might plead with God as he pleads with his neighbor!</verse>
  <verse number="22">For when only a few years are past I will go the way of no return.</verse>
