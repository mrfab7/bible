  <verse number="1">After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Job answered and said:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Let the day perish wherein I was born, And the night which said, There is a man-child conceived.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Let that day be darkness; Let not God from above seek for it, Neither let the light shine upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own; Let a cloud dwell upon it; Let all that maketh black the day terrify it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it: Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Lo, let that night be barren; Let no joyful voice come therein.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Let them curse it that curse the day, Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark: Let it look for light, but have none; Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Because it shut not up the doors of my mother’s womb, Nor hid trouble from mine eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bare me?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should suck?</verse>
  <verse number="13">For now should I have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept; then had I been at rest,</verse>
  <verse number="14">With kings and counsellors of the earth, Who built up waste places for themselves;</verse>
  <verse number="15">Or with princes that had gold, Who filled their houses with silver</verse>
  <verse number="16">Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, As infants that never saw light.</verse>
  <verse number="17">There the wicked cease from troubling; And there the weary are at rest.</verse>
  <verse number="18">There the prisoners are at ease together; They hear not the voice of the taskmaster.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The small and the great are there: And the servant is free from his master.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, And life unto the bitter in soul;</verse>
  <verse number="21">Who long for death, but it cometh not, And dig for it more than for hid treasures;</verse>
  <verse number="22">Who rejoice exceedingly, And are glad, when they can find the grave?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, And whom God hath hedged in?</verse>
  <verse number="24">For my sighing cometh before I eat, And my groanings are poured out like water.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For the thing which I fear cometh upon me, And that which I am afraid of cometh unto me.</verse>
  <verse number="26">I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; But trouble cometh.</verse>
