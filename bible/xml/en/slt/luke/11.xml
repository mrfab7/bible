  <verse number="1">And it was in his being in a certain place praying, when he ceased, a certain of his disciples said to him Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he said to them, When ye pray, say, Our Father he in the heavens, Holy be thy name. Let thy kingdom come. Let thy will be, as in heaven, also upon the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Give us our bread sufficient for sustenance by the day.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And remit to us our sins; for we ourselves also remit to everyone indebted to us. And bring us not into temptation; but deliver us from the evil.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he said to them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and should say to him. Friend, lend me three loaves;</verse>
  <verse number="6">Since my friend has come to me from the way, and I have not what I may set before him?</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he within, having answered, should say, offer not weariness to me: already has the door been shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot having risen, give thee.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I say to you, If also having risen he will not give him because of being his friend, yet for his effrontery, having risen, he will give him as many as he needs.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For every one asking, receives; and he seeking, finds; and to him knocking, it shall be opened.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And shall a son ask bread of any of you a father, will he give him a stone? And if a fish, for a fish he will not give him a serpent.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Or also if he ask an egg, he will not give him a scorpion.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If then ye, being evil, know to give good gifts to your children; how much more the Father, he from heaven, will give the Holy Spirit to them asking him?</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he was casting out a demon, and it was dumb. And it was the demon having come out, the dumb spake; and the crowds wondered.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And certain of them said. By Beelzebul ruler of demons he casts out demons.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And others, tempting, sought a sign of him from heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is rendered desolate; and a house against a house falls.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And if Satan also be divided against himself, how should his kingdom stand? for ye say by Beelzebul I cast out demons.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And if I by Beelzebul cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast, out? for this shall they be your judges.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And if by the finger of God I cast out demons, then has the kingdom of God got beforehand to you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">When the strong, completely armed, should watch his court-yard, his possessions are in peace:</verse>
  <verse number="22">And when a stronger than he, having come, conquers him, he takes away his complete armor in which he trusted, and distributes his spoils.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He not being with me is against me: and he not gathering with me scatters.</verse>
  <verse number="24">When the unclean spirit comes out from a man, he passes through places wanting water, seeking rest; and not finding, he says, I will return to my house whence I came out.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And having come, he finds it swept and set in order.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Then he goes, and takes seven other spirits more evil than himself; and having entered, they dwell there: and the last things of that man are worse than the first.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And it was in his speaking these things, a certain woman of the crowd, having lifted up the voice, said to him, in the heavens, where the thief approaches not, nor moth corrupts. Happy the womb having borne thee, and breasts thou didst suck.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And he said, Rather, happy they hearing the word of God, and watching it.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And crowds being collected, he began to say, This is an evil generation: it seeks a sign; and no sign shall be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For as Jonas was a sign to the Ninevites, so shall be the Son of man to this generation.</verse>
  <verse number="31">The queen of the south shall be raised up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and shall condemn them: for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, more than Solomon here.</verse>
  <verse number="32">The Ninevite men shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and condemn it: for they repented at the proclamation of Jonas; and, behold, more than Jonas here.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And none, having lighted a lamp, puts in secret, neither under a bushel, but upon the chandelier, that they coming in should see the light.</verse>
  <verse number="34">The light of the body is the eye; when therefore thine eye be plain, also thy whole body is clear: and when it be evil, also thy body dark.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Take heed therefore lest the light in thee be darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="36">If therefore thy whole body clear, not having any part dark, the whole shall be clear, as when a lamp enlightens thee with its gleam.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And in the speaking, a certain Pharisee asked him that he would dine with him: and having come in he reclined.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And the Pharisee having seen, wondered that he was not first washed before dinner.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And the Lord said to him, Now ye Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and trencher; and your inside is full of plunder and wickedness.</verse>
  <verse number="40">O foolish, has not he having made the outside, also made the inside?</verse>
  <verse number="41">But of the things being, give alms; and, behold, all things are clean to you.</verse>
  <verse number="42">But woe to you, Pharisees! for ye tithe spearmint and rue and every plant, and ye pass by the judgment and love of God: these ought ye to have done, and not to have left those.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Woe to you, Pharisees! for ye love the first seat in assemblies, and greetings in market-places.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as concealed tombs, and men walking above know not.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And a certain of the skilled in the law having answered, said, Teacher, speaking these things, and thou injurest us.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And he said, And woe to you, skilled in the law! for ye load men with loads difficult to carry, and ye yourselves touch not one of the fingers to the load.</verse>
  <verse number="47">Woe to you! for ye build the tombs of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.</verse>
  <verse number="48">Surely ye testify and assent to your fathers works: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their tombs.</verse>
  <verse number="49">And for this said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and the sent, and of them shall they kill and drive out:</verse>
  <verse number="50">That the blood of all the prophets shed from the foundation of the world be required of this generation;</verse>
  <verse number="51">From the blood of Abel even to the blood of Zacharias perishing between the altar and house: yea, I say to you, It shall be required of this generation.</verse>
  <verse number="52">Woe to you, skilled in the law! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: ye came not in yourselves, and those coming in ye hindered.</verse>
  <verse number="53">And he saying these things to them, the scribes and Pharisees began to hold on greatly, and to put questions to him of many things:</verse>
  <verse number="54">Laying wait for him, and seeking to seize something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.</verse>
