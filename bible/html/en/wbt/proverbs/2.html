<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">So that thou incline thy ear to wisdom, and apply thy heart to understanding;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Yes, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; and every good path.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">When wisdom entereth into thy heart, and knowledge is pleasant to thy soul;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger who flattereth with her words;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Who forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For her house inclineth to death, and her paths to the dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">None that go to her return again, neither do they take hold of the paths of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</p>
