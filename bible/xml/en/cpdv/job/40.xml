<chapter book="Job" number="40" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And the Lord continued, and he said to Job:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Will he who contends with God be so easily silenced? Certainly, he who argues with God must also respond to him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then Job answered the Lord, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="4">What could I possibly answer, since I have been speaking thoughtlessly? I will place my hand over my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">One thing I have spoken, which I wish I had not said; and another, to which I will add no more.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But the Lord, answering Job out of the whirlwind, said:</verse>
  <verse number="7">Gird your waist like a man. I will question you, and you must answer me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Will you make my judgment null and void; and will you condemn me so that you may be justified?</verse>
  <verse number="9">And do you have an arm like God, or a voice like thunder?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Envelop yourself with splendor, and raise yourself up on high, and be glorious, and put on splendid garments.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Scatter the arrogant with your wrath, and, when you see all the arrogant, humble them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Look down upon each of the arrogant and confound them, and crush the impious in their place.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Hide them in the dust together and plunge their faces into the pit.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then I will confess that your right hand is able to save you.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Behold, the behemoth, whom I created along with you, eats hay like an ox.</verse>
  <verse number="16">His strength is in his lower back, and his power is in the center of his abdomen.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He draws up his tail like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs have been drawn together.</verse>
  <verse number="18">His bones are like pipes of brass; his cartilage is like plates of iron.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He is the beginning of the ways of God, who made him; he will use him as his sword.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The mountains bring forth grass for him; all the beasts of the field will play there.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He sleeps in the shadows, under the cover of branches, and in moist places.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The shadows cover his shadow; the willows of the brook will encircle him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Behold, he will drink a river and not be amazed, and he has confidence that the Jordan could flow into his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He will seize him through his eyes, as if with a hook, and he will bore through his nostrils, as if with stakes.</verse>
