<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“How long will you speak these things? Shall the words of your mouth be a mighty wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert righteousness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If your children have sinned against him, He has delivered them into the hand of their disobedience.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If you want to seek God diligently, make your supplication to the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If you were pure and upright, surely now he would awaken for you, and make the habitation of your righteousness prosperous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Though your beginning was small, yet your latter end would greatly increase.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">“Please inquire of past generations. Find out about the learning of their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days on earth are a shadow.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Shall they not teach you, tell you, and utter words out of their heart?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">“Can the papyrus grow up without mire? Can the rushes grow without water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">While it is yet in its greenness, not cut down, it withers before any other reed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">So are the paths of all who forget God. The hope of the godless man shall perish,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Whose confidence shall break apart, Whose trust is a spider’s web.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He shall lean on his house, but it shall not stand. He shall cling to it, but it shall not endure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He is green before the sun. His shoots go forth over his garden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">His roots are wrapped around the rock pile. He sees the place of stones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If he is destroyed from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, ‘I have not seen you.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Behold, this is the joy of his way: out of the earth, others shall spring.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">“Behold, God will not cast away a blameless man, neither will he uphold the evildoers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He will still fill your mouth with laughter, your lips with shouting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Those who hate you shall be clothed with shame. The tent of the wicked shall be no more.”</p>
