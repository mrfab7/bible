1	And I determined this to myself, not to come to you again in sadness.
2	For if I grieve you, and who is he making me glad, except he being grieved by me.
3	And I wrote this same to you lest, coming, I should have sadness from whom I ought to rejoice, trusting to you all, that mine is the joy of you all.
4	For out of much pressure and anxiety of heart I wrote to you through many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love I have more abundantly towards you.
5	And if any have grieved, he has not grieved me, but by part; that I might not overload you all.
6	Sufficient to such a one this enjoyment of the esteem of the many.
7	So that on the contrary ye should rather show kindness, and console, lest perhaps such be swallowed down with more abundant sadness.
8	Wherefore I beseech you to confirm love to him.
9	For, for this I also wrote, that I might know the proof of you, if ye are obedient for all things.
10	And to whom ye show any favor; I also: for also if I have shown any kindness, to whom I have shown kindness, through you in the face of Christ;
11	That we might not be taken advantage of by Satan: for we are not ignorant of his inventions.
12	And coming to Troas for the good news of Christ, and a door having been opened to me in the Lord,
13	I have had no relaxation to my spirit, in my not finding Titus my brother: but having taken leave of them, I went out to Macedonia.
14	Grace to God, always leading us to triumph in Christ, and making manifest the order of his knowledge by us in every place.
15	For we are to God a sweet odor of Christ, in the saved, and in the host:
16	Truly to those an odor of death into death; and to those an odor of life into life. And who sufficient for these things?
17	For we are not as the many adulterating the word of God: but as of purity, but as of God, before the face of God speak we in Christ.
