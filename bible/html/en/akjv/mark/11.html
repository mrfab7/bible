<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sends forth two of his disciples,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And said to them, Go your way into the village over against you: and as soon as you be entered into it, you shall find a colt tied, where on never man sat; loose him, and bring him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And if any man say to you, Why do you this? say you that the Lord has need of him; and straightway he will send him here.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And certain of them that stood there said to them, What do you, loosing the colt?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And they said to them even as Jesus had commanded: and they let them go.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off the trees, and strewed them in the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that comes in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round about on all things, and now the eventide was come, he went out to Bethany with the twelve.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Jesus answered and said to it, No man eat fruit of you hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he taught, saying to them, Is it not written, My house shall be called of all nations the house of prayer? but you have made it a den of thieves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people was astonished at his doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And when even was come, he went out of the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Peter calling to remembrance said to him, Master, behold, the fig tree which you cursed is withered away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Jesus answering said to them, Have faith in God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For truly I say to you, That whoever shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass; he shall have whatever he said.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Therefore I say to you, What things soever you desire, when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you shall have them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And say to him, By what authority do you these things? and who gave you this authority to do these things?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Jesus answered and said to them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men? answer me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you not believe him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">But if we shall say, Of men; they feared the people: for all men counted John, that he was a prophet indeed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And they answered and said to Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</p>
