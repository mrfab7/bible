<chapter book="2 Timothy" number="4" translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" translationID="jps" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">I solemnly implore you, in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus who is about to judge the living and the dead, and by His Appearing and His Kingship:</verse>
  <verse number="2">proclaim God’s message, be zealous in season and out of season; convince, rebuke, encourage, with the utmost patience as a teacher.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For a time is coming when they will not tolerate wholesome instruction, but, wanting to have their ears tickled, they will find a multitude of teachers to satisfy their own fancies;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and will turn away from listening to the truth and will turn aside to fables.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But as for you, you must exercise habitual self-control, and not live a self-indulgent life, but do the duty of an evangelist and fully discharge the obligations of your office.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I for my part am like a drink-offering which is already being poured out; and the time for my departure is now close at hand.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I have gone through the glorious contest; I have run the race; I have guarded the faith.</verse>
  <verse number="8">From this time onward there is reserved for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day, and not only to me, but also to all who love the thought of His Appearing.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Make an effort to come to me speedily.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For Demas has deserted me—loving, as he does, the present age—and has gone to Thessalonica; Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Luke is the only friend I now have with me. Call for Mark on your way and bring him with you, for he is a great help to me in my ministry.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.</verse>
  <verse number="13">When you come, bring with you the cloak which I left behind at Troas at the house of Carpus, and the books, but especially the parchments.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Alexander the metal-worker showed bitter hostility towards me: the Lord will requite him according to his doings.</verse>
  <verse number="15">You also should beware of him; for he has violently opposed our preaching.</verse>
  <verse number="16">At my first defence I had no one at my side, but all deserted me. May it not be laid to their charge.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The Lord, however, stood by me and filled me with inward strength, that through me the Message might be fully proclaimed and that all the Gentiles might hear it; and I was rescued from the lion’s jaws.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The Lord will deliver me from every cruel attack and will keep me safe in preparation for His heavenly Kingdom. To Him be the glory until the Ages of the Ages! Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Erastus stayed in Corinth; Trophimus I left behind me at Miletus, ill.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Make an effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you all.</verse>
