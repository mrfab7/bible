<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Can a man be profitable to God? surely it is unto himself that the wise man is profitable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if thou art righteous? And is it gain [to him] that thou makest thy ways perfect?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Will he reason with thee for fear of thee? Will he enter with thee into judgment?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities without end?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For thou hast taken a pledge of thy brother for nought, and stripped off the clothing of the naked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thou hast not given water to the fainting to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But the powerful man, he had the land; and the man of high rank dwelt in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Widows hast thou sent empty away, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Or darkness, that thou canst not see, and floods of waters cover thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Is not +God in the height of the heavens? And behold the summit of the stars: how exalted are they!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And thou sayest, What doth God know? will he judge through the dark cloud?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh on the vault of the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Dost thou mark the ancient path which wicked men have trodden?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Who were carried off before the time, whose foundation was overflowed with a flood;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Who said unto God, Depart from us! and what could the Almighty do to them?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Yet he filled their houses with good. But the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The righteous see it, and are glad; and the innocent laugh them to scorn:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Is not he who rose against us destroyed, and doth not the fire consume his residue?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Reconcile thyself now with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Receive, I pray thee, instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in thy heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up. If thou remove unrighteousness far from thy tents,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And put the precious ore with the dust, and [the gold of] Ophir among the stones of the torrents,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Then the Almighty will be thy precious ore, and silver heaped up unto thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Yea, then shalt thou delight thyself in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto +God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he will hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And thou shalt decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee; and light shall shine upon thy ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">When they are made low, then thou shalt say, Rise up! and he shall save him that is of downcast eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">[Even] him that is not innocent shall he deliver; yea, he shall be delivered by the pureness of thy hands.</p>
