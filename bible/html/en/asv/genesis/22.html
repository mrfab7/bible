<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And it came to pass after these things, that God did prove Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham; and he said, Here am I.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son, whom thou lovest, even Isaac, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt-offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his ass, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he clave the wood for the burnt-offering, and rose up, and went unto the place of which God had told him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the place afar off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder; and we will worship, and come again to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Abraham took the wood of the burnt-offering, and laid it upon Isaac his son; and he took in his hand the fire and the knife; and they went both of them together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold, the fire and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt-offering?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Abraham said, God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt-offering, my son: so they went both of them together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, upon the wood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the angel of Jehovah called unto him out of heaven, and said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And he said, Lay not thy hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him; for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son, from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by his horns: and Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt-offering in the stead of his son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of Jehovah it shall be provided.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the angel of Jehovah called unto Abraham a second time out of heaven,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">and said, By myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah, because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is upon the seashore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beer-sheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beer-sheba.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And it came to pass after these things, that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she also hath borne children unto thy brother Nahor:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Uz his first-born, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father of Aram,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">and Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Bethuel begat Rebekah. These eight did Milcah bear to Nahor, Abrahamâ€™s brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she also bare Tebah, and Gaham, and Tahash, and Maacah.</p>
