  <verse number="1">Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and rapine; the prey departeth not.</verse>
  <verse number="2">The noise of the whip, and the noise of the rattling of wheels; and pransing horses, and jumping chariots;</verse>
  <verse number="3">the horseman mounting, and the flashing sword, and the glittering spear; and a multitude of slain, and a great heap of carcases: and there is none end of the corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:</verse>
  <verse number="4">because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the well favoured harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will discover thy skirts upon thy face; and I will shew the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Art thou better than No-amon, that was situate among the rivers, that had the waters round about her; whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was of the sea?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put and Lubim were thy helpers.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her great men were bound in chains.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Thou also shalt be drunken, thou shalt be hid; thou also shalt seek a strong hold because of the enemy.</verse>
  <verse number="12">All thy fortresses shall be like fig trees with the firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women; the gates of thy land are set wide open unto thine enemies: the fire hath devoured thy bars.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Draw thee water for the siege, strengthen thy fortresses: go into the clay, and tread the mortar, make strong the brickkiln.</verse>
  <verse number="15">There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off, it shall devour thee like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locust.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the cankerworm spoileth, and flieth away.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy marshals as the swarms of grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not known where they are.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy worthies are at rest: thy people are scattered upon the mountains, and there is none to gather them.</verse>
  <verse number="19">There is no assuaging of thy hurt; thy wound is grievous: all that hear the bruit of thee clap the hands over thee; for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?</verse>
