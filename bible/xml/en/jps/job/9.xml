  <verse number="1">Then Job answered and said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Of a truth I know that it is so; And how can man be just with God?</verse>
  <verse number="3">If one should desire to contend with Him, He could not answer Him one of a thousand.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength; Who hath hardened himself against Him, and prospered?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Who removeth the mountains, and they know it not, When He overturneth them in His anger.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Who shaketh the earth out of her place, And the pillars thereof tremble.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Who commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; And sealeth up the stars.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Who alone stretcheth out the heavens, And treadeth upon the waves of the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Who maketh the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades, And the chambers of the south.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Who doeth great things past finding out; Yea, marvellous things without number.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Lo, He goeth by me, and I see Him not. He passeth on also, but I perceive Him not.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Behold, He snatcheth away, who can hinder Him? Who will say unto Him: ‘What doest Thou?’</verse>
  <verse number="13">God will not withdraw His anger; The helpers of Rahab did stoop under Him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">How much less shall I answer Him, And choose out my arguments with Him?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer; I would make supplication to Him that contendeth with me.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If I had called, and He had answered me; Yet would I not believe that He would hearken unto my voice—</verse>
  <verse number="17">He that would break me with a tempest, And multiply my wounds without cause;</verse>
  <verse number="18">That would not suffer me to take my breath, But fill me with bitterness.</verse>
  <verse number="19">If it be a matter of strength, lo, He is mighty! And if of justice, who will appoint me a time?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Though I be righteous, mine own mouth shall condemn me; Though I be innocent, He shall prove me perverse.</verse>
  <verse number="21">I am innocent—I regard not myself, I despise my life.</verse>
  <verse number="22">It is all one—therefore I say: He destroyeth the innocent and the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If the scourge slay suddenly, He will mock at the calamity of the guiltless.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; He covereth the faces of the judges thereof; If it be not He, who then is it?</verse>
  <verse number="25">Now my days are swifter than a runner; They flee away, they see no good.</verse>
  <verse number="26">They are passed away as the swift ships; As the vulture that swoopeth on the prey.</verse>
  <verse number="27">If I say: ‘I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad countenance, and be of good cheer’,</verse>
  <verse number="28">I am afraid of all my pains, I know that Thou wilt not hold me guiltless.</verse>
  <verse number="29">I shall be condemned; Why then do I labour in vain?</verse>
  <verse number="30">If I wash myself with snow water, And make my hands never so clean;</verse>
  <verse number="31">Yet wilt Thou plunge me in the ditch, And mine own clothes shall abhor me.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For He is not a man, as I am, that I should answer Him, That we should come together in judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="33">There is no arbiter betwixt us, That might lay his hand upon us both.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Let Him take His rod away from me, And let not His terror make me afraid;</verse>
  <verse number="35">Then would I speak, and not fear Him; For I am not so with myself.</verse>
