<chapter book="Proverbs" number="5" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My son, attend unto my wisdom; incline thine ear to my understanding:</verse>
  <verse number="2">That thou mayest preserve discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil:</verse>
  <verse number="4">But her latter end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on Sheol;</verse>
  <verse number="6">So that she findeth not the level path of life: her ways are unstable and she knoweth it not.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Lest strangers be filled with thy strength; and thy labours be in the house of an alien;</verse>
  <verse number="11">And thou mourn at thy latter end, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</verse>
  <verse number="12">And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</verse>
  <verse number="13">Neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</verse>
  <verse number="14">I was well nigh in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Should thy springs be dispersed abroad, and rivers of water in the streets?</verse>
  <verse number="17">Let them be for thyself alone, and not for strangers with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Let thy fountain be blessed; and rejoice in the wife of thy youth.</verse>
  <verse number="19">As a loving hind and a pleasant doe, let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</verse>
  <verse number="21">For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he maketh level all his paths.</verse>
  <verse number="22">His own iniquities shall take the wicked, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He shall die for lack of instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</verse>
