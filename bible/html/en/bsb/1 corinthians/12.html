<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="12" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now about spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">You know that when you were pagans, you were influenced and led astray to mute idols.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Therefore I inform you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus be cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">There are different gifts, but the same Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">There are different ministries, but the same Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">There are different ways of working, but the same God works all things in all people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">To one there is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, to another the message of knowledge by the same Spirit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in various tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, who apportions them to each one as He determines.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The body is a unit, though it is composed of many parts. And although its parts are many, they all form one body. So it is with Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free, and we were all given one Spirit to drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For the body does not consist of one part, but of many.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But in fact, God has arranged the members of the body, every one of them, according to His design.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If they were all one part, where would the body be?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">As it is, there are many parts, but one body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The eye cannot say to the hand, “I do not need you.” Nor can the head say to the feet, “I do not need you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">and the parts we consider less honorable, we treat with greater honor. And our unpresentable parts are treated with special modesty,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">whereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God has composed the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">so that there should be no division in the body, but that its members should have mutual concern for one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Now you are the body of Christ, and each of you is a member of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, and those with gifts of healing, helping, administration, and various tongues.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But eagerly desire the greater gifts. And now I will show you the most excellent way.</p>
