  <verse number="1">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: The gate of the inner enclosure turning to the east shall be shut six days of work; and in the day of the Sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the prince went in the way of the porch of the gate from without, and he stood by the door-posts of the gate, and the priests did his burnt-offerings and his peace, and he worshiped upon the threshold of the gate, and he went forth: and the gate shall not be shut until the evening.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the people of the land worshiped at the door of that gate in the Sabbaths and in the new moons, before Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the burnt-offering which the prince shall bring near to Jehovah in the day of the Sabbath, six blameless lambs, and a blameless ram.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the gift an ephah to a ram, a gift for the lambs the giving of his hand, and the oil, an hin to the ephah</verse>
  <verse number="6">And in the day of the new moon, a blameless bullock, the son of a cow, and six lambs and a ram: they shall be blameless.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And an ephah to the bullock and an ephah to a ram shall he do the gift, and to the lambs, according as his hand shall attain, and the oil, an hin to the ephah.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And in the going in of the prince he shall go in the way of the porch of the gate, and in its way he shall go forth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And In the going in of the people of the land before Jehovah in the appointments, he going in the way of the gate of the north to worship, shall come forth the way of the gate of the south; and he going in the way of the gate of the south, shall come forth the way of the gate of the north: he shall not turn back the way which he came in it, but he shall come forth opposite to it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the prince in the midst of them, in their going in, shall go in; and in their going forth, his going forth.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And in the festivals and in the appointments the gift shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs the giving of his hand, and the oil, an bin to the ephah.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And when the prince shall do a voluntary gift of a burnt-offering or peace a voluntary gift to Jehovah, and he opened to him the gate turning to the east, and he did his burnt-offering and his peace according as he will do in the day of the Sabbath: and he went forth and shut the gate after his going forth.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And a blameless lamb the son of his year thou shalt do for a burnt-offering for the day to Jehovah: in the morning, by the morning, shalt thou do it.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And thou shalt do the gift for it in the morning by the morning, the sixth of an ephah, and the oil, the third of an hin, to sprinkle the fine flour; a gift to Jehovah a law forever, continually.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And prepare ye the lamb and the gift, and the oil, in the morning, by the morning, a burnt-offering continually.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: If the prince shall give a gift to a man of his sons, of his inheritance, it shall be to his sons; this their possession by inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And if he shall give a gift of his inheritance to one of his servants, and it was to him until the year of liberty; and it turned back to the prince: but his inheritance his sons’; to them it shall be.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the prince shall not take of the inheritance of the people to oppress them, from their possession; from his possession he shall cause his sons to inherit, so that my people shall not be scattered each from his possession.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And he will bring me through the entrance which is by the shoulder of the gate, into the cells of the holy place, to the priests, turning to the north: and behold, there a place upon the two thighs of the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he will say to me, This the place where the priests shall boil there the trespass and the sin, where they shall cook the gift; not to bring forth to the enclosure without to consecrate the people.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he will bring me forth to the enclosure without, and he will cause me to pass through to the four angles of the enclosure; and behold, an enclosure in an angle of the enclosure; an enclosure in an angle of the enclosure.</verse>
  <verse number="22">In the four angles of the enclosure, enclosures shut up, forty the length and thirty the breadth: one measure to these four angles.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And a wall round about in them, round about to them four, and boiling places made from under the walls round about.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And he will say to me, These the house of those boiling where those serving the house shall boil there the sacrifice of the people.</verse>
