<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="8" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And concerning sacrifice to idols, we know, (for we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, and love builds the house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And if any one thinks to know anything, as yet he has known nothing as he ought to know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And if any one love God, the same is known of him.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Concerning food therefore of sacrifices to idols, we know that an idol nothing in the world, and that none other God but one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For also though they are called gods, whether in heaven, whether upon the earth, (for there are many gods, and many lords,)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But to us one God, the Father, of whom all things, and we for him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom all things, and we by him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But not in all, knowledge: and some with consciousness of the idol even till now eat as a sacrifice to idols: and their consciousness being weak is contaminated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And food sets us not before God: for neither, if we eat, do we abound; neither if we eat not, do we want.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And see ye lest this your power be a stumble to the weak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For if any one see thee having knowledge reclining in the idolâ€™s temple, shall not his consciousness, being weak, be built up to eat the sacrifices to idols;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And shall the weak brother be destroyed upon thy knowledge, for whom Christ died?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And so sinning against the brethren, and striking their weak consciousness, ye sin against Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Wherefore, if food offend my brother, I will eat no flesh forever, lest I shall offend my brother.</p>
