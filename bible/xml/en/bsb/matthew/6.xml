<chapter book="Matthew" number="6" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">“Be careful not to perform your righteous acts before men to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="2">So when you give to the needy, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by men. Truly I tell you, they already have their full reward.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</verse>
  <verse number="4">so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. Truly I tell you, they already have their full reward.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But when you pray, go into your inner room, shut your door, and pray to your Father, who is unseen. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And when you pray, do not babble on like pagans, for they think that by their many words they will be heard.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">So then, this is how you should pray: ‘Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Give us this day our daily bread.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.’</verse>
  <verse number="14">For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive yours.</verse>
  <verse number="16">When you fast, do not be somber like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting. Truly I tell you, they already have their full reward.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,</verse>
  <verse number="18">so that your fasting will not be obvious to men, but only to your Father, who is unseen. And your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eyes are good, your whole body will be full of light.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But if your eyes are bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light within you is darkness, how great is that darkness!</verse>
  <verse number="24">No one can serve two masters: Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes?</verse>
  <verse number="26">Look at the birds of the air: They do not sow or reap or gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?</verse>
  <verse number="27">Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?</verse>
  <verse number="28">And why do you worry about clothes? Consider how the lilies of the field grow: They do not labor or spin.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his glory was adorned like one of these.</verse>
  <verse number="30">If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the furnace, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?</verse>
  <verse number="31">Therefore do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’</verse>
  <verse number="32">For the Gentiles strive after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.</verse>
  <verse number="33">But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Today has enough trouble of its own.</verse>
