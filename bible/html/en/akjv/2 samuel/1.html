<div class="chapter" data-book="2 Samuel" data-chapter="1" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had stayed two days in Ziklag;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth on his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And David said to him, From where come you? And he said to him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And David said to him, How went the matter? I pray you, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And David said to the young man that told him, How know you that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance on mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned on his spear; and, see, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, Here am I.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he said to me, Who are you? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He said to me again, Stand, I pray you, on me, and slay me: for anguish is come on me, because my life is yet whole in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">So I stood on him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was on his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them here to my lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And David said to the young man that told him, From where are you? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And David said to him, How were you not afraid to stretch forth your hand to destroy the LORD’s anointed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall on him. And he smote him that he died.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And David said to him, Your blood be on your head; for your mouth has testified against you, saying, I have slain the LORD’s anointed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The beauty of Israel is slain on your high places: how are the mighty fallen!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">You mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, on you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">You daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold on your apparel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">How are the mighty fallen in the middle of the battle! O Jonathan, you were slain in your high places.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant have you been to me: your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</p>
