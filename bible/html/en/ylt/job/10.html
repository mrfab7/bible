<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My soul hath been weary of my life, I leave off my talking to myself, I speak in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I say unto God, ‘Do not condemn me, Let me know why Thou dost strive with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is it good for Thee that Thou dost oppress? That Thou despisest the labour of Thy hands, And on the counsel of the wicked hast shone?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Eyes of flesh hast Thou? As man seeth—seest Thou?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">As the days of man are Thy days? Thy years as the days of a man?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">That Thou inquirest for mine iniquity, And for my sin seekest?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For Thou knowest that I am not wicked, And there is no deliverer from Thy hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Thy hands have taken pains about me, And they make me together round about, And Thou swallowest me up!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Remember, I pray Thee, That as clay Thou hast made me, And unto dust Thou dost bring me back.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Dost Thou not as milk pour me out? And as cheese curdle me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Skin and flesh Thou dost put on me, And with bones and sinews dost fence me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Life and kindness Thou hast done with me. And Thy inspection hath preserved my spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And these Thou hast laid up in Thy heart, I have known that this is with Thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If I sinned, then Thou hast observed me, And from mine iniquity dost not acquit me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If I have done wickedly—woe to me, And righteously—I lift not up my head, Full of shame—then see my affliction,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And it riseth—as a lion Thou huntest me. And Thou turnest back—Thou shewest Thyself wonderful in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Thou renewest Thy witnesses against me, And dost multiply Thine anger with me, Changes and warfare are with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And why from the womb Hast Thou brought me forth? I expire, and the eye doth not see me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">As I had not been, I am, From the belly to the grave I am brought,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Are not my days few? Cease then, and put from me, And I brighten up a little,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Before I go, and return not, Unto a land of darkness and death-shade,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A land of obscurity as thick darkness, Death-shade—and no order, And the shining is as thick darkness.’</p>
