<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Call, I pray thee! Is there any that answereth thee? and to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For vexation killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the simple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I myself saw the foolish taking root, but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, and there is no deliverer:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh even out of the thorns; and the snare gapeth for his substance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For evil cometh not forth from the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upwards.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But as for me I will seek unto God, and unto God commit my cause;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who doeth great things and unsearchable, marvellous things without number;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who giveth rain on the face of the earth, and sendeth waters on the face of the fields;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Setting up on high those that are low; and mourners are exalted to prosperity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, and their hands carry not out the enterprise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; and the counsel of the wily is carried headlong:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">They meet with darkness in a the daytime, and grope at midday as in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he saveth the needy from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">So the poor hath what he hopeth for, and unrighteousness stoppeth her mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Behold, happy is the man whom +God correcteth; therefore despise not the chastening of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For he maketh sore, and bindeth up; he woundeth, and his hands make whole.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He will deliver thee in six troubles, and in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In famine he will redeem thee from death, and in war from the power of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Thou shalt be hidden from the scourge of the tongue; and thou shalt not be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh, and of the beasts of the earth thou shalt not be afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace; and thou wilt survey thy fold, and miss nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And thou shalt know that thy seed is numerous, and thine offspring as the herb of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Thou shalt come to the grave in a ripe age, as a shock of corn is brought in in its season.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Behold this, we have searched it out, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thyself.</p>
