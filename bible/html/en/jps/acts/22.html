<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“Brethren and fathers,” he said, “listen to my defence which I now make before you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And on hearing him address them in Hebrew, they kept all the more quiet; and he said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">“I am a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city. I was carefully trained at the feet of Gamaliel in the Law of our forefathers, and, like all of you to-day, was zealous for God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I persecuted to death this new faith, continually binding both men and women and throwing them into prison;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">as the High Priest also and all the Elders can bear me witness. It was, too, from them that I received letters to the brethren in Damascus, and I was already on my way to Damascus, intending to bring those also who had fled there, in chains to Jerusalem, to be punished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">“But on my way, when I was now not far from Damascus, about noon a sudden blaze of light from Heaven shone round me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, “’Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">“’Who art thou, Lord?’ I asked. “’I am Jesus, the Nazarene,’ He replied, ‘whom you are persecuting.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">“Now the men who were with me, though they saw the light, did not hear the words of Him who spoke to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I asked, “’What am I to do, Lord?’ “And the Lord said to me, “’Rise, and go into Damascus. There you shall be told of all that has been appointed for you to do.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">“And as I could not see because the light had been so dazzling, those who were with me had to lead me by the arm, and so I came to Damascus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">“And a certain Ananias, a pious man who obeyed the Law and bore a good character with all the Jews of the city,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">came to me and standing at my side said, “’Brother Saul, recover your sight.’ “I instantly regained my sight and looked up at him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then he said, ‘The God of our forefathers has appointed you to know His will, and to see the righteous One and hear Him speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For you shall be a witness for Him, to all men, of what you have seen and heard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And now why delay? Rise, get yourself baptized, and wash off your sins, calling upon His name.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">“After my return to Jerusalem, and while praying in the Temple, I fell into a trance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I saw Jesus, and He said to me, “’Make haste and leave Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about Me.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">“’Lord,’ I replied, ‘they themselves well know how active I was in imprisoning, and in flogging in synagogue after synagogue those who believe in Thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">and when they were shedding the blood of Stephen, Thy witness, I was standing by, fully approving of it, and I held the clothes of those who were killing him.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">“’Go,’ He replied; ‘I will send you as an Apostle to nations far away.’”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Until they heard this last statement the people listened to Paul, but now with a roar of disapproval they cried out, “Away with such a fellow from the earth! He ought not to be allowed to live.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And when they continued their furious shouts, throwing their clothes into the air and flinging dust about,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">the Tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and be examined by flogging, in order to ascertain the reason why they thus cried out against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But, when they had tied him up with the straps, Paul said to the Captain who stood by, “Does the Law permit you to flog a Roman citizen—and one too who is uncondemned?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">On hearing this question, the Captain went to report the matter to the Tribune. “What are you intending to do?” he said. “This man is a Roman citizen.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">So the Tribune came to Paul and asked him, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” “Yes,” he said.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">“I paid a large sum for my citizenship,” said the Tribune. “But I was born free,” said Paul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">So the men who had been on the point of putting him under torture immediately left him. And the Tribune, too, was frightened when he learnt that Paul was a Roman citizen, for he had had him bound.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The next day, wishing to know exactly what charge was being brought against him by the Jews, the Tribune ordered his chains to be removed; and, having sent word to the High Priests and all the Sanhedrin to assemble, he brought Paul down and made him stand before them.</p>
