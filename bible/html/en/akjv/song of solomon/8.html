<p class="verse" data-verse="1">O that you were as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find you without, I would kiss you; yes, I should not be despised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I would lead you, and bring you into my motherâ€™s house, who would instruct me: I would cause you to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who is this that comes up from the wilderness, leaning on her beloved? I raised you up under the apple tree: there your mother brought you forth: there she brought you forth that bore you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Set me as a seal on your heart, as a seal on your arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which has a most vehement flame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">We have a little sister, and she has no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">If she be a wall, we will build on her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will enclose her with boards of cedar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard to keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: you, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">You that dwell in the gardens, the companions listen to your voice: cause me to hear it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Make haste, my beloved, and be you like to a roe or to a young hart on the mountains of spices.</p>
