<chapter book="Philemon" number="1" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy, a brother: to Philemon, our beloved and fellow labourer;</verse>
  <verse number="2">And to Appia, our dearest sister, and to Archippus, our fellow soldier, and to the church which is in thy house:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I give thanks to my God, always making a remembrance of thee in my prayers.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Hearing of thy charity and faith, which thou hast in the Lord Jesus, and towards all the saints:</verse>
  <verse number="6">That the communication of thy faith may be made evident in the acknowledgment of every good work, that is in you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For I have had great joy and consolation in thy charity, because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Wherefore though I have much confidence in Christ Jesus, to command thee that which is to the purpose:</verse>
  <verse number="9">For charity sake I rather beseech, whereas thou art such a one, as Paul an old man, and now a prisoner also of Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I beseech thee for my son, whom I have begotten in my bands, Onesimus,</verse>
  <verse number="11">Who hath been heretofore unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable both to me and thee,</verse>
  <verse number="12">Whom I have sent back to thee. And do thou receive him as my own bowels.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered to me in the bands of the gospel:</verse>
  <verse number="14">But without thy counsel I would do nothing: that thy good deed might not be as it were of necessity, but voluntary.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For perhaps he therefore departed for a season from thee, that thou mightest receive him again for ever:</verse>
  <verse number="16">Not now as a servant, but instead of a servant, a most dear brother, especially to me: but how much more to thee both in the flesh and in the Lord?</verse>
  <verse number="17">If therefore thou count me a partner, receive him as myself.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And if he hath wronged thee in any thing, or is in thy debt, put that to my account.</verse>
  <verse number="19">I Paul have written it with my own hand: I will repay it: not to say to thee, that thou owest me thy own self also.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Yea, brother. May I enjoy thee in the Lord. Refresh my bowels in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Trusting in thy obedience, I have written to thee: knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But withal prepare me also a lodging. For I hope that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="23">There salute thee Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;</verse>
  <verse number="24">Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke my fellow labourers.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>
