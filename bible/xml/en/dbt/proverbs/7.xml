<chapter book="Proverbs" number="7" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Keep my commandments, and live; and my teaching, as the apple of thine eye.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the tablet of thy heart.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister, and call intelligence [thy] kinswoman:</verse>
  <verse number="5">that they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger who flattereth with her words.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For at the window of my house, I looked forth through my lattice,</verse>
  <verse number="7">and I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the sons, a young man void of understanding,</verse>
  <verse number="8">passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</verse>
  <verse number="9">in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the blackness of night and the darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And behold, there met him a woman in the attire of a harlot, and subtle of heart.</verse>
  <verse number="11">She is clamorous and unmanageable; her feet abide not in her house:</verse>
  <verse number="12">now without, now in the broadways,—and she lieth in wait at every corner.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And she caught him and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,</verse>
  <verse number="14">I have peace-offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows:</verse>
  <verse number="15">therefore came I forth to meet thee, to seek earnestly thy face, and I have found thee.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I have decked my bed with tapestry coverlets of variegated linen from Egypt;</verse>
  <verse number="17">I have perfumed my couch with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Come, let us revel in love until the morning, let us delight ourselves with loves.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For the husband is not at home, he is gone a long journey;</verse>
  <verse number="20">he hath taken the money-bag with him, he will come home on the day of the full moon.</verse>
  <verse number="21">With her much enticement she beguiled him; with the smoothness of her lips she constrained him.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He went after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, and as stocks [serve] for the correction of the fool;</verse>
  <verse number="23">till an arrow strike through his liver: as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for its life.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And now, ye sons, hearken unto me, and attend to the words of my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Let not thy heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths:</verse>
  <verse number="26">for she hath cast down many wounded, and all slain by her were strong.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.</verse>
