<p class="verse" data-verse="1">We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">(For he said, I have heard you in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succored you: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Giving no offense in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">By pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">By honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">O you Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">You are not straitened in us, but you are straitened in your own bowels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Now for a recompense in the same, (I speak as to my children,) be you also enlarged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Be you not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And what concord has Christ with Belial? or what part has he that believes with an infidel?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for you are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Why come out from among them, and be you separate, said the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And will be a Father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, said the Lord Almighty.</p>
