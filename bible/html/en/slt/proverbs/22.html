<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A Name to be chosen rather than much riches, and good grace rather than gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The rich and poor one met together: Jehovah made them all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The crafty saw evil, and he will hide, and the simple passed on and were punished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The end of humility the fear of Jehovah, riches and honor and life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thorns, snares, in the way of the perverse one: he watching his soul shall be far from them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Straiten to a youth upon the mouth of his way, also when he shall grow old he will not depart from it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The rich one will rule over the poor, and he borrowing, a servant to the man lending.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He sowing iniquity shall reap vanity, and the rod of his wrath shall be finished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The good eye it shall be blessed, for he gave from his bread to the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Cast out him mocking, and strife shall go out, and contention shall cease and dishonor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He loving pureness of heart the grace of his lips, the king is his friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The eyes of Jehovah guarded knowledge, and he will overthrow the words of him transgressing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The slothful one said, A lion without; I shall be slain in the midst of the broad places.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The mouth of the strange woman a deep pit: and he cursing Jehovah shall fall there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Folly being bound in the heart of a youth; the rod of correction shall remove it far off from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He oppressing the poor one to increase for himself, he gave to the rich; also to want.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Incline thine ear and hear the words of the wise, and thou shalt set thy heart to my knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For pleasant things if thou shalt watch them in thy belly; they shall be prepared together for thy lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For thy trust to be in Jehovah, I caused thee to know today, thee also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Did I not write to thee three days ago in counsels and knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">To cause thee to know the truth of the words of truth; to turn back the words of truth to those sending thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Thou shalt not strip the poor because he is poor: and thou shalt not crush the humble in the gate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For Jehovah will contend their contention, and rob the soul to those robbing them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Thou shalt not be companion of the possessor of anger, and with the man of wrath thou shalt not go:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Lest thou shalt learn his ways and take a snare to thy soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Thou shalt not be with those striking the hand with those pledging for debts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">If not to thee to requite, why shall he take thy bed from under thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Thou shalt not remove the old bound which thy fathers made.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Sawest thou a man apt in his works? Before kings shall he stand; he shall not stand before the dark ones.</p>
