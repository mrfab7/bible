<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="13" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profits me nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Charity suffers long, and is kind; charity envies not; charity braggs not itself, is not puffed up,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Does not behave itself unseemly, seeks not her own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Charity never fails: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And now stays faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.</p>
