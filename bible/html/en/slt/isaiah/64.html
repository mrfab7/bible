<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Would that thou didst rend the heavens; thou camest down; the mountains flowed from before thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As the fire of meltings was kindled the fire will cause the water to boil, to cause thy name to be known to thine adversaries; from thy face shall the nations be moved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">In thy doing wonderful things we shall not expect, thou camest down, the mountains flowed from before thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">From forever they heard not, they gave not ear, the eye saw not, O God, besides thee, he will do to him waiting for him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thou mettest him rejoicing and doing justice, they shall remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou wert angry; and we shall sin in them of old, and we shall be saved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And we were all as the unclean, and all our justice as the garment of monthly courses; and we shall all fail away as the leaf; and our iniquities as the wind will take us away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And none calling upon thy name, none rousing himself to take hold upon thee: for thou hiddest thy face from us, and thou wilt melt us by the hand of our iniquities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And now, O Jehovah, thou our Father; we the clay and thou forming us; and we all the work of thy hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Thou wilt not be angry, O Jehovah, even greatly, and not forever wilt thou remember iniquity: behold, look now, Ye are all thy people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The cities of thy holy place were desert; Zion was a desert, Jerusalem a desolation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The house of our holy place and our glory where our fathers praised thee, was for a burning of fire, and all our precious things were for desolation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For these wilt thou refrain thyself, O Jehovah? wilt thou be silent, and wilt thou humble us even greatly?</p>
