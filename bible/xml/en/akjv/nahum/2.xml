  <verse number="1">He that dashes in pieces is come up before your face: keep the fortification, watch the way, make your loins strong, fortify your power mightily.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For the LORD has turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall jostle one against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like torches, they shall run like the lightning.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the defense shall be prepared.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves, beating on their breasts.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look back.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Take you the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant furniture.</verse>
  <verse number="10">She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melts, and the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feeding place of the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion’s whelp, and none made them afraid?</verse>
  <verse number="12">The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with shred.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Behold, I am against you, said the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour your young lions: and I will cut off your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers shall no more be heard.</verse>
