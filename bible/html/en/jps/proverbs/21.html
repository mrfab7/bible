<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="21" data-translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" data-translation-id="jps" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The king’s heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the watercourses: He turneth it whithersoever He will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Every way of a man is right in his own eyes; But the LORD weigheth the hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">To do righteousness and justice Is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A haughty look, and a proud heart—The tillage of the wicked is sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; But every one that is hasty hasteth only to want.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The getting of treasures by a lying tongue Is a vapour driven to and fro; they [that seek them] seek death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The violence of the wicked shall drag them away; Because they refuse to do justly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The way of man is froward and strange; But as for the pure, his work is right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, Than in a house in common with a contentious woman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The soul of the wicked desireth evil; His neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">When the scorner is punished, the thoughtless is made wise; And when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The Righteous One considereth the house of the wicked; Overthrowing the wicked to their ruin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, He also shall cry himself, but shall not be answered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">A gift in secret pacifieth anger, And a present in the bosom strong wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">To do justly is joy to the righteous, But ruin to the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The man that strayeth out of the way of understanding Shall rest in the congregation of the shades.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man; He that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The wicked is a ransom for the righteous; And the faithless cometh in the stead of the upright.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">It is better to dwell in a desert land, Than with a contentious and fretful woman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">There is desirable treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise; But a foolish man swalloweth it up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He that followeth after righteousness and mercy Findeth life, prosperity, and honour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, And bringeth down the stronghold wherein it trusteth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue Keepeth his soul from troubles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">A proud and haughty man, scorner is his name, Even he that dealeth in overbearing pride.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The desire of the slothful killeth him; For his hands refuse to labour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">There is that coveteth greedily all the day long; But the righteous giveth and spareth not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination; How much more, when he bringeth it with the proceeds of wickedness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A false witness shall perish; But the man that obeyeth shall speak unchallenged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">A wicked man hardeneth his face; But as for the upright, he looketh well to his way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">There is no wisdom nor understanding Nor counsel against the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The horse is prepared against the day of battle; But victory is of the LORD.</p>
