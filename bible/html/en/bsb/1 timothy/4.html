<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Timothy" data-chapter="4" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now the Spirit expressly states that in later times some will abandon the faith to follow deceitful spirits and the teachings of demons,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">influenced by the hypocrisy of liars, whose consciences are seared with a hot iron.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They will prohibit marriage and require abstinence from certain foods that God has created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For every creation of God is good, and nothing that is received with thanksgiving should be rejected,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">because it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">By pointing out these things to the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished by the words of faith and sound instruction that you have followed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But reject irreverent, silly myths. Instead, train yourself for godliness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For physical exercise is of limited value, but godliness is valuable in every way, holding promise for the present life and for the one to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">This is a trustworthy saying, worthy of full acceptance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">To this end we labor and strive, because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of everyone, and especially of those who believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Command and teach these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let no one despise your youth, but set an example for the believers in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, and to teaching.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given you through the prophecy spoken over you at the laying on of the hands of the elders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Be diligent in these matters and absorbed in them, so that your progress will be evident to all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Pay close attention to your life and to your teaching. Persevere in these things, for by so doing you will save both yourself and those who hear you.</p>
