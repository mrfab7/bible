  <verse number="1">Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Who is this that darkeneth counsel By words without knowledge?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Gird up now thy loins like a man; For I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto Me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou hast the understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Who determined the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who stretched the line upon it?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened? Or who laid the corner-stone thereof,</verse>
  <verse number="7">When the morning stars sang together, And all the sons of God shouted for joy?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Or who shut up the sea with doors, When it broke forth, and issued out of the womb;</verse>
  <verse number="9">When I made the cloud the garment thereof, And thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,</verse>
  <verse number="10">And prescribed for it My decree, And set bars and doors,</verse>
  <verse number="11">And said: ‘Thus far shalt thou come, but no further; And here shall thy proud waves be stayed’?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days began, And caused the dayspring to know its place;</verse>
  <verse number="13">That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, And the wicked be shaken out of it?</verse>
  <verse number="14">It is changed as clay under the seal; And they stand as a garment.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But from the wicked their light is withholden, And the high arm is broken.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? Or hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep?</verse>
  <verse number="17">Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee? Or hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Hast thou surveyed unto the breadths of the earth? Declare, if thou knowest it all.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Where is the way to the dwelling of light, And as for darkness, where is the place thereof;</verse>
  <verse number="20">That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, And that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Thou knowest it, for thou wast then born, And the number of thy days is great!</verse>
  <verse number="22">Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow, Or hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, Against the day of battle and war?</verse>
  <verse number="24">By what way is the light parted, Or the east wind scattered upon the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="25">Who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood, Or a way for the lightning of the thunder;</verse>
  <verse number="26">To cause it to rain on a land where no man is, On the wilderness, wherein there is no man;</verse>
  <verse number="27">To satisfy the desolate and waste ground, And to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?</verse>
  <verse number="28">Hath the rain a father? Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?</verse>
  <verse number="29">Out of whose womb came the ice? And the hoar-frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?</verse>
  <verse number="30">The waters are congealed like stone, And the face of the deep is frozen.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Canst thou bind the chains of the Pleiades, Or loose the bands of Orion?</verse>
  <verse number="32">Canst thou lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season? Or canst thou guide the Bear with her sons?</verse>
  <verse number="33">Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens? Canst thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="34">Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, That abundance of waters may cover thee?</verse>
  <verse number="35">Canst thou send forth lightnings, that they may go, And say unto thee: ‘Here we are’?</verse>
  <verse number="36">Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who hath given understanding to the mind?</verse>
  <verse number="37">Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,</verse>
  <verse number="38">When the dust runneth into a mass, And the clods cleave fast together?</verse>
  <verse number="39">Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lioness? Or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,</verse>
  <verse number="40">When they couch in their dens, And abide in the covert to lie in wait?</verse>
  <verse number="41">Who provideth for the raven his prey, When his young ones cry unto God, and wander for lack of food?</verse>
