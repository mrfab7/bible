  <verse number="1">Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that behold, the place was a place for cattle;</verse>
  <verse number="2">The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="3">Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:</verse>
  <verse number="5">Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given to thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Moses said to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?</verse>
  <verse number="7">And why discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the LORD’S anger was kindled the same time, and he swore, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="11">Surely none of the men that came up from Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:</verse>
  <verse number="12">Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the LORD’S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the LORD was consumed.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And behold, ye have risen up in your fathers’ stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD towards Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and he will destroy all this people.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they came near to him, and said, We will build sheep-folds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:</verse>
  <verse number="17">But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities, because of the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="18">We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For we will not inherit with them on the other side of Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance hath fallen to us on this side of Jordan eastward.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Moses said to them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the LORD to war,</verse>
  <verse number="21">And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the land shall be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:</verse>
  <verse number="27">But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord saith.</verse>
  <verse number="28">So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Moses said to them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed for battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:</verse>
  <verse number="30">But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD hath said to thy servants, so will we do.</verse>
  <verse number="32">We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with its cities in the borders, even the cities of the country around.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,</verse>
  <verse number="35">And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,</verse>
  <verse number="36">And Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fortified cities: and folds for sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim,</verse>
  <verse number="38">And Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names to the cities which they built.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite who was in it.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt in it.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its small towns, and called them Havoth-jair.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And Nobah went and took Kenath, and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name.</verse>
