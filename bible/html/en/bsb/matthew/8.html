<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Suddenly a leper came and knelt before Him, saying, “Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Jesus reached out His hand and touched the man. “I am willing,” He said. “Be clean!” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Then Jesus instructed him, “See that you don’t tell anyone. But go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift prescribed by Moses, as a testimony to them.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">When Jesus had entered Capernaum, a centurion came and pleaded with Him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">“Lord, my servant lies at home, paralyzed and in terrible agony.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">“I will go and heal him,” Jesus replied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The centurion answered, “Lord, I am not worthy to have You come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For I myself am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. I tell one to go, and he goes, and another to come, and he comes. I tell my servant to do something, and he does it.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">When Jesus heard this, He marveled and said to those following Him, “Truly I tell you, I have not found anyone in Israel with such great faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I say to you that many will come from the east and the west to share the banquet with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Then Jesus said to the centurion, “Go! As you have believed, so will it be done for you.” And his servant was healed at that very hour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">When Jesus arrived at Peter’s house, He saw Peter’s mother-in-law sick in bed with a fever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">So He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">When evening came, many who were demon-possessed were brought to Jesus, and He drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: “He took up our infirmities and carried our diseases.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">When Jesus saw a large crowd around Him, He gave orders to cross to the other side of the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And one of the scribes came to Him and said, “Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Jesus replied, “Foxes have dens and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay His head.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Another of His disciples requested, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But Jesus told him, “Follow Me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">When He got into the boat, His disciples followed Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Suddenly a violent storm came up on the sea, so that the boat was engulfed by the waves. But Jesus was sleeping.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The disciples went and woke Him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">“You of little faith,” Jesus replied, “why are you so afraid?” Then He got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and it was perfectly calm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The men were amazed and asked, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey Him!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">When Jesus arrived on the other side in the region of the Gadarenes, He was met by two demon-possessed men coming from the tombs. They were so violent that no one could pass that way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">“What do You want with us, Son of God?” they shouted. “Have You come here to torture us before the appointed time?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">In the distance a large herd of pigs was feeding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">So the demons begged Jesus, “If You drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">“Go!” He told them. So they came out and went into the pigs, and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and died in the waters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Those tending the pigs ran off into the town and reported all this, including the account of the demon-possessed men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Then the whole town went out to meet Jesus. And when they saw Him, they begged Him to leave their region.</p>
