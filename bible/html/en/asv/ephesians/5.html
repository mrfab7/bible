<div class="chapter" data-book="Ephesians" data-chapter="5" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for an odor of a sweet smell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not even be named among you, as becometh saints;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">nor filthiness, nor foolish talking, or jesting, which are not befitting: but rather giving of thanks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For this ye know of a surety, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Let no man deceive you with empty words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the sons of disobedience.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Be not ye therefore partakers with them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">for ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as children of light</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">(for the fruit of the light is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather even reprove them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">for the things which are done by them in secret it is a shame even to speak of.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But all things when they are reproved are made manifest by the light: for everything that is made manifest is light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Wherefore he saith, Awake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall shine upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Look therefore carefully how ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Wherefore be ye not foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And be not drunken with wine, wherein is riot, but be filled with the Spirit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">speaking one to another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">giving thanks always for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">subjecting yourselves one to another in the fear of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Wives, be in subjection unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of the church, being himself the saviour of the body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their husbands in everything.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">that he might present the church to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">for no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as Christ also the church;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">because we are members of his body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">This mystery is great: but I speak in regard of Christ and of the church.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she fear her husband.</p>
