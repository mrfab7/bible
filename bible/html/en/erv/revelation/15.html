<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having seven plagues, which are the last, for in them is finished the wrath of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And I saw as it were a glassy sea mingled with fire; and them that come victorious from the beast, and from his image, and from the number of his name, standing by the glassy sea, having harps of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God, the Almighty; righteous and true are thy ways, thou King of the ages.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who shall not fear, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for thou only art holy; for all the nations shall come and worship before thee; for thy righteous acts have been made manifest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And after these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and there came out from the temple the seven angels that had the seven plagues, arrayed with precious stone, pure and bright, and girt about their breasts with golden girdles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And one of the four living creatures gave unto the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and none was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels should be finished.</p>
