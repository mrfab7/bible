<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="3" data-translation="King James Bible" data-translation-id="kjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, [even] as unto babes in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able [to bear it], neither yet now are ye able.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For ye are yet carnal: for whereas [there is] among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I [am] of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who then is Paul, and who [is] Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, [ye are] God’s building.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which [temple] ye are.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And ye are Christ’s; and Christ [is] God’s.</p>
