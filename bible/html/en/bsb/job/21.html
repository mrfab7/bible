<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Listen carefully to my words; let this be your consolation to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Bear with me while I speak; then, after I have spoken, you may go on mocking.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Is my complaint against a man? Then why should I not be impatient?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Look at me and be appalled; put your hand over your mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When I remember, terror takes hold, and my body trembles in horror.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Their descendants are established around them, and their offspring before their eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Their homes are safe from fear; no rod of punishment from God is upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Their bulls breed without fail; their cows bear calves and do not miscarry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They send forth their little ones like a flock; their children skip about,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">singing to the tambourine and lyre and making merry at the sound of the flute.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They spend their days in prosperity and go down to Sheol in peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Yet they say to God: ‘Leave us alone! For we have no desire to know Your ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Who is the Almighty, that we should serve Him, and what would we gain if we pray to Him?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Still, their prosperity is not in their own hands, so I stay far from the counsel of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">How often is the lamp of the wicked put out? Does disaster come upon them? Does God, in His anger, apportion destruction?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Are they like straw before the wind, like chaff swept away by a storm?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">It is said that God lays up one’s punishment for his children. Let God repay the man himself, so he will know it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Let his eyes see his own destruction; let him drink for himself the wrath of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For what does he care about his household after him, when the number of his months has run out?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Can anyone teach knowledge to God, since He judges those on high?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">One man dies full of vigor, completely secure and at ease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">His body is well nourished, and his bones are rich with marrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Yet another man dies in the bitterness of his soul, having never tasted prosperity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But together they lie down in the dust, and worms cover them both.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Behold, I know your thoughts full well, the schemes by which you would wrong me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For you say, ‘Where now is the nobleman’s house, and where are the tents in which the wicked dwell?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Have you never asked those who travel the roads? Do you not accept their reports?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Indeed, the evil man is spared from the day of calamity, delivered from the day of wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Who denounces his behavior to his face? Who repays him for what he has done?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He is carried to the grave, and watch is kept over his tomb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The clods of the valley are sweet to him; everyone follows behind him, and those before him are without number.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">So how can you comfort me with empty words? For your answers remain full of falsehood.”</p>
