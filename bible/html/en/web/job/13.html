<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“Behold, my eye has seen all this. My ear has heard and understood it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">What you know, I know also. I am not inferior to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">“Surely I would speak to the Almighty. I desire to reason with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But you are forgers of lies. You are all physicians of no value.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Oh that you would be completely silent! Then you would be wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Hear now my reasoning. Listen to the pleadings of my lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Will you speak unrighteously for God, and talk deceitfully for him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Will you show partiality to him? Will you contend for God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Is it good that he should search you out? Or as one deceives a man, will you deceive him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He will surely reprove you if you secretly show partiality.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Shall not his majesty make you afraid, And his dread fall on you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defenses are defenses of clay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">“Be silent, leave me alone, that I may speak. Let come on me what will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Why should I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in my hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold, he will kill me. I have no hope. Nevertheless, I will maintain my ways before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">This also shall be my salvation, that a godless man shall not come before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Hear diligently my speech. Let my declaration be in your ears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">See now, I have set my cause in order. I know that I am righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Who is he who will contend with me? For then would I hold my peace and give up the spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">“Only don’t do two things to me; then I will not hide myself from your face:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">withdraw your hand far from me; and don’t let your terror make me afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Then call, and I will answer; or let me speak, and you answer me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">How many are my iniquities and sins? Make me know my disobedience and my sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Why hide you your face, and hold me for your enemy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Will you harass a driven leaf? Will you pursue the dry stubble?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For you write bitter things against me, and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">You also put my feet in the stocks, and mark all my paths. You set a bound to the soles of my feet,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">though I am decaying like a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten.</p>
