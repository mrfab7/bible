<div class="chapter" data-book="2 Timothy" data-chapter="2" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the things that you have heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit you to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">You therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">No man that wars entangles himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The farmer that labors must be first partaker of the fruits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Consider what I say; and the Lord give you understanding in all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even to bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If we believe not, yet he stays faithful: he cannot deny himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Study to show yourself approved to God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase to more ungodliness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And their word will eat as does a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his. And, Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honor, and some to dishonor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel to honor, sanctified, and meet for the master’s use, and prepared to every good work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do engender strifes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle to all men, apt to teach, patient,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.</p>
