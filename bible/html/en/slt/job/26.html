<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job will answer and say,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How didst thou help to him of no strength? didst thou save the arm of no strength?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">How didst thou counsel to him of no wisdom? and didst thou make known help for abundance?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And with whom didst thou announce words? and whose breath came forth from thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The shades shall tremble from under the waters, and their inhabitants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Hades is naked before him, and no covering to destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He stretched out the north upon emptiness, he hung up the earth upon nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He bound up the waters in his clouds, and the cloud was not rent under them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Holding fast the face of the throne, he spread his cloud upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He marked out with a compass the law upon the face of the waters, even till the end of light with darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The pillars of the heavens shall be shaken, and be astonished from his reproof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">By his power he caused the sea to tremble; by his understanding he smote through pride.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">By his spirit he polished the heavens; his hand pierced the flat serpent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Behold these the ends of his ways; how transient a sound of the word was heard in him! and the thunder of his might who shall understand?</p>
