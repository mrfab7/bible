  <verse number="1">Forasmuch as many have undertaken to draw up a relation concerning the matters fully believed among us,</verse>
  <verse number="2">as those who from the beginning were eye-witnesses of and attendants on the Word have delivered them to us,</verse>
  <verse number="3">it has seemed good to me also, accurately acquainted from the origin with all things, to write to thee with method, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
  <verse number="4">that thou mightest know the certainty of those things in which thou hast been instructed.</verse>
  <verse number="5">There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest, by name Zacharias, of the course of Abia, and his wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And they were both just before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both advanced in years.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it came to pass, as he fulfilled his priestly service before God in the order of his course,</verse>
  <verse number="9">it fell to him by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter into the temple of the Lord to burn incense.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And all the multitude of the people were praying without at the hour of incense.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And an angel of [the] Lord appeared to him, standing on the right of the altar of incense.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Zacharias was troubled, seeing [him], and fear fell upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias, because thy supplication has been heard, and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he shall be to thee joy and rejoicing, and many shall rejoice at his birth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For he shall be great before [the] Lord, and he shall drink no wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with [the] Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And many of the sons of Israel shall he turn to [the] Lord their God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he shall go before him in [the] spirit and power of Elias, to turn hearts of fathers to children, and disobedient ones to [the] thoughts of just [men], to make ready for [the] Lord a prepared people.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Zacharias said to the angel, How shall I know this, for I am an old man, and my wife advanced in years?</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the angel answering, said to him, I am Gabriel, who stand before God, and I have been sent to speak to thee, and to bring these glad tidings to thee;</verse>
  <verse number="20">and behold, thou shalt be silent and not able to speak, till the day in which these things shall take place, because thou hast not believed my words, the which shall be fulfilled in their time.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the people were awaiting Zacharias, and they wondered at his delaying in the temple.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But when he came out he could not speak to them, and they recognised that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he was making signs to them, and continued dumb.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And it came to pass, when the days of his service were completed, he departed to his house.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Now after these days, Elizabeth his wife conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="25">Thus has [the] Lord done to me in [these] days in which he looked upon [me] to take away my reproach among men.</verse>
  <verse number="26">But in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent of God to a city of Galilee, of which [the] name [was] Nazareth,</verse>
  <verse number="27">to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name [was] Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name [was] Mary.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the angel came in to her, and said, Hail, [thou] favoured one! the Lord [is] with thee: [blessed art thou amongst women].</verse>
  <verse number="29">But she, [seeing] [the angel], was troubled at his word, and reasoned in her mind what this salutation might be.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found favour with God;</verse>
  <verse number="31">and behold, thou shalt conceive in the womb and bear a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="32">He shall be great, and shall be called Son of [the] Highest; and [the] Lord God shall give him the throne of David his father;</verse>
  <verse number="33">and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for the ages, and of his kingdom there shall not be an end.</verse>
  <verse number="34">But Mary said to the angel, How shall this be, since I know not a man?</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the angel answering said to her, [The] Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and power of [the] Highest overshadow thee, wherefore the holy thing also which shall be born shall be called Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And behold, Elizabeth, thy kinswoman, she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month to her that was called barren:</verse>
  <verse number="37">for nothing shall be impossible with God.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And Mary said, Behold the bondmaid of [the] Lord; be it to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And Mary, rising up in those days, went into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah,</verse>
  <verse number="40">and entered into the house of Zacharias, and saluted Elizabeth.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And it came to pass, as Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with [the] Holy Spirit,</verse>
  <verse number="42">and cried out with a loud voice and said, Blessed [art] thou amongst women, and blessed the fruit of thy womb.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And whence [is] this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
  <verse number="44">For behold, as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped with joy in my womb.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And blessed [is] she that has believed, for there shall be a fulfilment of the things spoken to her from [the] Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,</verse>
  <verse number="47">and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour.</verse>
  <verse number="48">For he has looked upon the low estate of his bondmaid; for behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</verse>
  <verse number="49">For the Mighty One has done to me great things, and holy [is] his name;</verse>
  <verse number="50">and his mercy [is] to generations and generations to them that fear him.</verse>
  <verse number="51">He has wrought strength with his arm; he has scattered haughty [ones] in the thought of their heart.</verse>
  <verse number="52">He has put down rulers from thrones, and exalted the lowly.</verse>
  <verse number="53">He has filled the hungry with good things, and sent away the rich empty.</verse>
  <verse number="54">He has helped Israel his servant, in order to remember mercy,</verse>
  <verse number="55">(as he spoke to our fathers,) to Abraham and to his seed for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="56">And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her house.</verse>
  <verse number="57">But the time was fulfilled for Elizabeth that she should bring forth, and she gave birth to a son.</verse>
  <verse number="58">And her neighbours and kinsfolk heard that [the] Lord had magnified his mercy with her, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
  <verse number="59">And it came to pass on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called it after the name of his father, Zacharias.</verse>
  <verse number="60">And his mother answering said, No; but he shall be called John.</verse>
  <verse number="61">And they said to her, There is no one among thy kinsfolk who is called by this name.</verse>
  <verse number="62">And they made signs to his father as to what he might wish it to be called.</verse>
  <verse number="63">And having asked for a writing-table, he wrote saying, John is his name. And they all wondered.</verse>
  <verse number="64">And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue, and he spake, blessing God.</verse>
  <verse number="65">And fear came upon all who dwelt round about them; and in the whole hill-country of Judaea all these things were the subject of conversation.</verse>
  <verse number="66">And all who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, What then will this child be? And [the] Lord’s hand was with him.</verse>
  <verse number="67">And Zacharias his father was filled with [the] Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="68">Blessed be [the] Lord the God of Israel, because he has visited and wrought redemption for his people,</verse>
  <verse number="69">and raised up a horn of deliverance for us in the house of David his servant;</verse>
  <verse number="70">as he spoke by [the] mouth of his holy prophets, who have been since the world began;</verse>
  <verse number="71">deliverance from our enemies and out of the hand of all who hate us;</verse>
  <verse number="72">to fulfil mercy with our fathers and remember his holy covenant,</verse>
  <verse number="73">[the] oath which he swore to Abraham our father,</verse>
  <verse number="74">to give us, that, saved out of the hand of our enemies, we should serve him without fear</verse>
  <verse number="75">in piety and righteousness before him all our days.</verse>
  <verse number="76">And thou, child, shalt be called [the] prophet of [the] Highest; for thou shalt go before the face of [the] Lord to make ready his ways;</verse>
  <verse number="77">to give knowledge of deliverance to his people by [the] remission of their sins</verse>
  <verse number="78">on account of [the] bowels of mercy of our God; wherein [the] dayspring from on high has visited us,</verse>
  <verse number="79">to shine upon them who were sitting in darkness and in [the] shadow of death, to guide our feet into [the] way of peace.</verse>
  <verse number="80">—And the child grew and was strengthened in spirit; and he was in the deserts until the day of his shewing to Israel.</verse>
