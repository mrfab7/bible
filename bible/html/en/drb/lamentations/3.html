<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Aleph. I am the man that see my poverty by the rod of his indignation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Aleph. He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, and not into light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Aleph. Only against me he hath turned, and turned again his hand all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Beth. My skin and my flesh he hath made old, he hath broken my bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Beth. He hath built round about me, and he hath compassed me with gall and labour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Beth. He hath set me in dark places as those that are dead for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Ghimel. He hath built against me round about, that I may not get out: he hath made my fetters heavy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Ghimel. Yea, and when I cry, and entreat, he hath shut out my prayer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Ghimel. He hath shut up my ways with square stones, he hath turned my paths upside down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Daleth. He is become to me as a bear lying in wait: as a lion in secret places.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Daleth. He hath turned aside my paths, and hath broken me in pieces, he hath made me desolate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Daleth. He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for his arrows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He. He hath shot into my reins the daughters of his quiver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He. I am made a derision to all my people, their song all the day long.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He. He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath inebriated me with wormwood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Vau. And he hath broken my teeth one by one, he hath fed me with ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Vau. And my soul is removed far off from peace, I have forgotten good things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Vau. And I said: My end and my hope is perished from the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Zain. Remember my poverty, and transgression, the wormwood, and the gall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Zain. I will be mindful and remember, and my soul shall languish within me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Zain. These things I shall think over in my heart, therefore will I hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Heth. The mercies of the Lord that we are not consumed: because his commiserations have not failed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Heth. They are new every morning, great is thy faithfulness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Heth. The Lord is my portion, said my soul: therefore will I wait for him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Teth. The Lord is good to them that hope in him, to the soul that seeketh him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Teth. It is good to wait with silence for the salvation of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Teth. It is good for a man, when he hath borne the yoke from his youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Jod. He shall sit solitary, and hold his peace: because he hath taken it up upon himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Jod. He shall put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Jod. He shall give his cheek to him that striketh him, he shall be filled with reproaches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Caph. For the Lord will not cast off for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Caph. For if he hath cast off, he will also have mercy, according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Caph. For he hath not willingly afflicted, nor cast off the children of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Lamed. To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the land,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Lamed. To turn aside the judgment of a man before the face of the most High,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Lamed. To destroy a man wrongfully in his judgment, the Lord hath not approved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Mem. Who is he that hath commanded a thing to be done, when the Lord commandeth it not?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">Mem. Shall not both evil and good proceed out of the mouth of the Highest?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Mem. Why hath a living man murmured, man suffering for his sins?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Nun. Let us search our ways, and seek, and return to the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Nun. Let us lift up our hearts with our hands to the Lord in the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">Nun. We have done wickedly, and provoked thee to wrath: therefore thou art inexorable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">Samech. Thou hast covered in thy wrath, and hast struck us: thou hast killed and hast not spared.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">Samech. Thou hast set a cloud before thee, that our prayer may not pass through.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Samech. Thou hast made me as an outcast, and refuse in the midst of the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">Phe. All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">Phe. Prophecy is become to us a fear, and a snare, and destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">Phe. My eye hath run down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">Ain. My eye is afflicted, and hath not been quiet, because there was no rest:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">Ain. Till the Lord regarded and looked down from the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">Ain. My eye hath wasted my soul because of all the daughters of my city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">Sade. My enemies have chased me and caught me like a bird, without cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">Sade. My life is fallen into the pit, and they have laid a stone over me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">Sade. Waters have flowed over my head: I said: I am cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">Coph. I have called upon thy name, O Lord, from the lowest pit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">Coph. Thou hast heard my voice: turn not away thy ear from my sighs, and cries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="57">Coph. Thou drewest near in the day, when I called upon thee, thou saidst: Fear not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="58">Res. Thou hast judged, O Lord, the cause of my soul, thou the Redeemer of my life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="59">Res. Thou hast seen, O Lord, their iniquity against me: judge thou my judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="60">Res. Thou hast seen all their fury, and all their thoughts against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="61">Sin. Thou hast heard their reproach, O Lord, all their imaginations against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="62">Sin. The lips of them that rise up against me: and their devices against me all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="63">Sin. Behold their sitting down, and their rising up, I am their song.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="64">Thau. Thou shalt render them a recompense, O Lord, according to the works of their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="65">Thau. Thou shalt give them a buckler of heart, thy labour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="66">Thau. Thou shalt persecute them in anger, and shalt destroy them from under the heavens, O Lord.</p>
