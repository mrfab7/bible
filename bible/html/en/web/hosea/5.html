<div class="chapter" data-book="Hosea" data-chapter="5" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“Listen to this, you priests! Listen, house of Israel, and give ear, house of the king! For the judgment is against you; for you have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread on Tabor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The rebels are deep in slaughter; but I discipline all of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hidden from me; for now, Ephraim, you have played the prostitute. Israel is defiled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Their deeds won’t allow them to turn to their God; for the spirit of prostitution is within them, and they don’t know Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The pride of Israel testifies to his face. Therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity. Judah also will stumble with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">They will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Yahweh; but they won’t find him. He has withdrawn himself from them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They are unfaithful to Yahweh; for they have borne illegitimate children. Now the new moon will devour them with their fields.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">“Blow the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah! Sound a battle cry at Beth Aven, behind you, Benjamin!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Ephraim will become a desolation in the day of rebuke. Among the tribes of Israel, I have made known that which will surely be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The princes of Judah are like those who remove a landmark. I will pour out my wrath on them like water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Ephraim is oppressed, he is crushed in judgment; Because he is intent in his pursuit of idols.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Therefore I am to Ephraim like a moth, and to the house of Judah like rottenness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">“When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, Then Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to king Jareb: but he is not able to heal you, neither will he cure you of your wound.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For I will be to Ephraim like a lion, and like a young lion to the house of Judah. I myself will tear in pieces and go away. I will carry off, and there will be no one to deliver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I will go and return to my place, until they acknowledge their offense, and seek my face. In their affliction they will seek me earnestly.”</p>
