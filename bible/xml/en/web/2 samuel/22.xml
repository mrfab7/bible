  <verse number="1">David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song in the day that Yahweh delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:</verse>
  <verse number="2">and he said, “Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer, even mine;</verse>
  <verse number="3">God, my rock, in him I will take refuge; my shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge. My savior, you save me from violence.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I will call on Yahweh, who is worthy to be praised: So shall I be saved from my enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For the waves of death surrounded me. The floods of ungodliness made me afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The cords of Sheol were around me. The snares of death caught me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">In my distress I called on Yahweh. Yes, I called to my God. He heard my voice out of his temple. My cry came into his ears.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then the earth shook and trembled. The foundations of heaven quaked and were shaken, because he was angry.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Smoke went up out of his nostrils. Fire out of his mouth devoured. Coals were kindled by it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He bowed the heavens also, and came down. Thick darkness was under his feet.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He rode on a cherub, and flew. Yes, he was seen on the wings of the wind.</verse>
  <verse number="12">He made darkness pavilions around himself: gathering of waters, and thick clouds of the skies.</verse>
  <verse number="13">At the brightness before him, coals of fire were kindled.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Yahweh thundered from heaven. The Most High uttered his voice.</verse>
  <verse number="15">He sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and confused them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then the channels of the sea appeared. The foundations of the world were laid bare by the rebuke of Yahweh, At the blast of the breath of his nostrils.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He sent from on high and he took me. He drew me out of many waters.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He delivered me from my strong enemy, from those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">They came on me in the day of my calamity, but Yahweh was my support.</verse>
  <verse number="20">He also brought me out into a large place. He delivered me, because he delighted in me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Yahweh rewarded me according to my righteousness. He rewarded me according to the cleanness of my hands.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For all his ordinances were before me. As for his statutes, I did not depart from them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">I was also perfect toward him. I kept myself from my iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Therefore Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness, According to my cleanness in his eyesight.</verse>
  <verse number="26">With the merciful you will show yourself merciful. With the perfect man you will show yourself perfect.</verse>
  <verse number="27">With the pure you will show yourself pure. With the crooked you will show yourself shrewd.</verse>
  <verse number="28">You will save the afflicted people, But your eyes are on the haughty, that you may bring them down.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For you are my lamp, Yahweh. Yahweh will light up my darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For by you, I run against a troop. By my God, I leap over a wall.</verse>
  <verse number="31">As for God, his way is perfect. The word of Yahweh is tested. He is a shield to all those who take refuge in him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For who is God, besides Yahweh? Who is a rock, besides our God?</verse>
  <verse number="33">God is my strong fortress. He makes my way perfect.</verse>
  <verse number="34">He makes his feet like hinds’ feet, and sets me on my high places.</verse>
  <verse number="35">He teaches my hands to war, so that my arms bend a bow of brass.</verse>
  <verse number="36">You have also given me the shield of your salvation. Your gentleness has made me great.</verse>
  <verse number="37">You have enlarged my steps under me. My feet have not slipped.</verse>
  <verse number="38">I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them. I didn’t turn again until they were consumed.</verse>
  <verse number="39">I have consumed them, and struck them through, so that they can’t arise. Yes, they have fallen under my feet.</verse>
  <verse number="40">For you have armed me with strength for the battle. You have subdued under me those who rose up against me.</verse>
  <verse number="41">You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me, that I might cut off those who hate me.</verse>
  <verse number="42">They looked, but there was none to save; even to Yahweh, but he didn’t answer them.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth. I crushed them as the mire of the streets, and spread them abroad.</verse>
  <verse number="44">You also have delivered me from the strivings of my people. You have kept me to be the head of the nations. A people whom I have not known will serve me.</verse>
  <verse number="45">The foreigners will submit themselves to me. As soon as they hear of me, they will obey me.</verse>
  <verse number="46">The foreigners will fade away, and will come trembling out of their close places.</verse>
  <verse number="47">Yahweh lives! Blessed be my rock! Exalted be God, the rock of my salvation,</verse>
  <verse number="48">even the God who executes vengeance for me, who brings down peoples under me,</verse>
  <verse number="49">who brings me away from my enemies. Yes, you lift me up above those who rise up against me. You deliver me from the violent man.</verse>
  <verse number="50">Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations. Will sing praises to your name.</verse>
  <verse number="51">He gives great deliverance to his king, and shows loving kindness to his anointed, to David and to his seed, forevermore.”</verse>
