  <verse number="1">And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers’ house, of all their princes according to their fathers’ houses, twelve rods; thou shalt write every man’s name upon his rod.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And thou shalt write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi, for there shall be one rod for the head of their fathers’ houses.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And it shall come to pass, that the man whom I shall choose, his rod shall bud; and I will make to cease from Me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you.’</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers’ houses, even twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tent of the testimony.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and bore ripe almonds.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel; and they looked, and took every man his rod.</verse>
  <verse number="10">and the LORD said unto Moses: ‘Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept there, for a token against the rebellious children; that there may be made an end of their murmurings against Me, that they die not.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">Thus did Moses; as the LORD commanded him, so did he.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the children of Israel spoke unto Moses, saying: ‘Behold, we perish, we are undone, we are all undone.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Every one that cometh near, that cometh near unto the tabernacle of the LORD, is to die; shall we wholly perish?’</verse>
