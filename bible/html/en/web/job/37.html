<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“Yes, at this my heart trembles, and is moved out of its place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice, the sound that goes out of his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He sends it forth under the whole sky, and his lightning to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">After it a voice roars. He thunders with the voice of his majesty. He doesn’t hold back anything when his voice is heard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">God thunders marvelously with his voice. He does great things, which we can’t comprehend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For he says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth;’ likewise to the shower of rain, and to the showers of his mighty rain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He seals up the hand of every man, that all men whom he has made may know it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then the animals take cover, and remain in their dens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Out of its room comes the storm, and cold out of the north.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">By the breath of God, ice is given, and the breadth of the waters is frozen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Yes, he loads the thick cloud with moisture. He spreads abroad the cloud of his lightning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">It is turned around by his guidance, that they may do whatever he commands them on the surface of the habitable world,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whether it is for correction, or for his land, or for loving kindness, that he causes it to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">“Listen to this, Job. Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Do you know how God controls them, and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Do you know the workings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">You whose clothing is warm, when the earth is still by reason of the south wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Can you, with him, spread out the sky, which is strong as a cast metal mirror?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Teach us what we shall tell him, for we can’t make our case by reason of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Shall it be told him that I would speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Now men don’t see the light which is bright in the skies, but the wind passes, and clears them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Out of the north comes golden splendor. With God is awesome majesty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">We can’t reach the Almighty. He is exalted in power. In justice and great righteousness, he will not oppress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Therefore men revere him. He doesn’t regard any who are wise of heart.”</p>
