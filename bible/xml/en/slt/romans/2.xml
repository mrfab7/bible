  <verse number="1">Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, every one judging: for in what thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou judging doest the same.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon them doing such things.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And thinkest thou this, O man, judging them doing such things, and doing the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Or the abundance of his goodness and forbearance and long suffering dost thou despise; not knowing that the goodness of God brings thee to repentance?</verse>
  <verse number="5">And according to thy hardness and impenitent heart thou treasurest up to thyself anger in the day of anger and revelation of the just judgment of God;</verse>
  <verse number="6">Who will give back to each according to his works:</verse>
  <verse number="7">To them truly by perseverance of the good work they seek glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:</verse>
  <verse number="8">But to them of intrigue, and are truly disobedient to the truth, and yielding to injustice, anger and wrath,</verse>
  <verse number="9">Affliction and distress, upon every soul of man working evil, both of the Jew first, and of the Greek;</verse>
  <verse number="10">But glory, and honour, and peace, to every one working good, both to the Jew first, and to the Greek:</verse>
  <verse number="11">For there is no distinction of persons with God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For as many as sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;</verse>
  <verse number="13">(For not hearers of the law just with God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For when nations, not having the things of the law, by nature do the things of the law, these, not having the law, are law to themselves:</verse>
  <verse number="15">Which show the work of the law Written in their hearts, their consciousness testifying together, and between one another thoughts accusing or also excusing;)</verse>
  <verse number="16">In the day when God shall judge the concealed things of men according to my good news by Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Behold, thou art named a Jew, and restest upon the law, and boastest thyself in God,</verse>
  <verse number="18">And knowest the will, and triest things differing, being sounded out of the law;</verse>
  <verse number="19">And art persuaded thou thyself to be a guide of the blind, a light of them in darkness,</verse>
  <verse number="20">An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of the inexperienced, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Therefore teaching another, teachest thou not thyself proclaiming not to steal, stealest thou?</verse>
  <verse number="22">Speaking not to commit adultery, committest thou adultery? abhorring images, committest thou sacrilege?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Thou who boastest in the law, by transgression of the law dishonourest thou God?</verse>
  <verse number="24">For the name of God by you is blasphemed in the nations, as it has been written.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For truly circumcision profits, if thou do the law: and if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision has become uncircumcision.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Therefore if uncircumcision watch the justification of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be reckoned for circumcision?</verse>
  <verse number="27">And shall not uncircumcision by nature, completing the law, judge thee, which by letter and circumcision a transgressor of the law?</verse>
  <verse number="28">For he in appearance, is not a Jew; neither circumcision, in appearance in the flesh:</verse>
  <verse number="29">But he in concealment, a Jew; and circumcision of the heart, in spirit, not in letter; whose approbation not of man, but of God.</verse>
