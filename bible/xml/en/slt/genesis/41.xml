  <verse number="1">And it will be the end of two years of days, and Pharaoh dreamed; and behold, he stood by the river.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And behold, from the river came up seven heifers, fair of look and fat in flesh; and they will feed in marsh grass.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Behold, seven other heifers coming up after them out of the river, evil of look, thin in flesh; and they will stand by the heifers by the lip of the river.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the heifers evil of look and thin of flesh, will devour the seven heifers fair of look, and fat. And Pharaoh will awake.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he will sleep, and will dream the second time, and behold seven ears coming upon one stalk, fat and good.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And behold, seven ears thin and blasted by the east, springing up after them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the thin ears will devour the seven ears fat and full. And Pharaoh will awake, and behold, a dream.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it will be in the morning, and his soul will be troubled; and he will send and call all the sacred scribes of Egypt, and all his wise; and Pharaoh will relate to them his dream; and none interpreting them to Pharaoh.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the chief of the cup-bearers will speak to Pharaoh, saying, I, remembering my sin this day.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and gave me in guard in the house of the chief of the cooks, me and the chief of the bakers.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he: we dreamed a man according to the interpretation of his dream.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And there with us a Hebrew youth, servant to the chief of the cooks: and we shall relate to him, and he will interpret to us our dreams; and he interpreted a man according to his dream.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And it will be according to that he interpreted to us, thus it was: me he restored to my place, and him he hung.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Pharaoh will send and call Joseph, and they will cause him to run from the pit; and he will be shaved and will change his garments; and he will come to Pharaoh.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Pharaoh will say to Joseph, I dreamed a dream, and there is none interpreting it, and I heard concerning thee, saying, Thou wilt hear a dream to interpret it.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Joseph will answer Pharaoh, saying, Not in me: God will answer Pharaoh with peace.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Pharaoh will say to Joseph, In my dream I stood by the lip of the river.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And behold, from the river came up seven heifers, fat of flesh and fair of form, and they will feed in marsh grass.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And behold, seven other heifers coming up after them, poor and evil exceedingly, in form, and thin in flesh I saw not like them in all the land of Egypt for evil.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the heifers thin and evil will devour the first seven fat heifers.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they shall come into their belly, and they shall not know that they came into their belly; and evil of form as that in the beginning. And I shall awake.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And I shall see in my dream, and behold, seven ears coming up in one stalk, full and good.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And behold, seven ears dry, thin, blasted by the east, springing up after them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the thin ears will swallow the seven good ears: and I spake to the sacred scribes, and there was none announcing to me.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And Joseph will say to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh, one: this which he did; God announces to Pharaoh.</verse>
  <verse number="26">The seven good heifers, they are seven years; and the seven good ears, they are seven years: this dream one.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And the seven heifers, thin and evil, coming up after them, they are seven years; and the seven ears, thin, blasted by the east, shall be seven years of famine.</verse>
  <verse number="28">This the word which I spake to Pharaoh: what God did, he showed Pharaoh.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Behold, seven years coming of great plenty, in all the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And seven years of famine arose after them, and all the plenty was forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine consumed the land.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the plenty shall not be known in the land on account of the famine after this; for it shall be exceedingly heavy.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And because of the repeating of Pharaoh’s dream twice, that the word was prepared from God; and God is hastening to do it.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And now will Pharaoh look out a man discerning and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And will Pharaoh make and appoint overseers over the land, exacting a fifth part of the land of Egypt, in the seven years of plenty.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And they shall gather all the food of these good years coming, and they shall heap up the grain under the hand of Pharaoh, and they shall watch food in the cities.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And the food was for a deposit to the land, for the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; and the land shall not be cut off in the famine.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And the word will be good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And Pharaoh will say to his servants, Shall we find such as this man which has the spirit of God in him?</verse>
  <verse number="39">And Pharaoh will say to Joseph, After that God showed thee all this, none discerning and wise as thou.</verse>
  <verse number="40">Thou shalt be over my house, and to thy mouth all my people shall bend: only upon the throne I shall be great above thee.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And Pharaoh will say to Joseph, See, I gave thee over all the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And Pharaoh will remove his signet ring from his hand, and will give it upon Joseph’s hand; and will put upon him a white garment, and will put a gold collar about his neck.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And he will cause him to ride in the second chariot which is to him. And they will cry out before him, Aback. And he gave him over all the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And Pharaoh will say to Joseph, I am Pharaoh; and without thee, a man shall not lift up his hand and his foot in all the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And Pharaoh will call Joseph’s name Zaphnath-paaneah; and he will give to him Asenath, daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of Ain, for a wife; and Joseph will go forth over the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And Joseph the son of thirty years in his standing before Pharaoh, king of Egypt; and Joseph will go forth from the face of Pharaoh, and will pass over all the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And the earth will make in the seven years of plenty by handfuls.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And he will gather all the food of the seven years which were in the land of Egypt, and he will give the food in the cities: the food of the field of the city which round about her, he gave in the midst of her.</verse>
  <verse number="49">And Joseph will gather grain as the sand of the sea, exceedingly much that he ceased to number; for there was no numbering.</verse>
  <verse number="50">And to Joseph will be born two sons before the years of the famine will come: which Asenath, daughter of Poti-Pherah, priest of Ain, bare to him.</verse>
  <verse number="51">And Joseph will call the name of the first-born, Manasseh; for God made me forget all my toils and all my father’s house.</verse>
  <verse number="52">And the name of the second, he called Ephraim; for God caused me to flourish in the land of my affliction.</verse>
  <verse number="53">And the seven years of plenty will be completed, which was in the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="54">And the seven years of famine will begin to come, according to that Joseph said: and the famine will be in all the lands; and in all the land of Egypt was bread.</verse>
  <verse number="55">And all the land of Egypt shall hunger, and the people will cry out to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh will say to all Egypt, Go to Joseph; what he shall say to you, ye shall do.</verse>
  <verse number="56">And the famine was upon all the face of the earth: and Joseph will open all which in them, and he will sell to Egypt; and the famine was strong in the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="57">And all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy, for the famine was strong in all the earth.</verse>
