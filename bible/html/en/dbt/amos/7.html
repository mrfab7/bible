<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Thus did the Lord Jehovah shew unto me; and behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth, and behold, it was the latter growth after the king’s mowings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it came to pass, when they had wholly eaten the grass of the land, that I said, O Lord Jehovah, forgive, I beseech thee! How shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Jehovah repented for this: It shall not be, said Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thus did the Lord Jehovah shew unto me; and behold, the Lord Jehovah called to contend by fire; and it devoured the great deep, and ate up the inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then said I, O Lord Jehovah, cease, I beseech thee! How shall Jacob arise? for he is small.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Jehovah repented for this: This also shall not be, said the Lord Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thus did he shew unto me; and behold, the Lord stood upon a wall [made] by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Jehovah said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumb-line. And the Lord said, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the high places of Isaac shall be desolated, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will arise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For thus Amos saith: Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall certainly go into captivity out of his land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Amaziah said unto Amos, [Thou] seer, go, flee away into the land of Judah, and eat bread there, and prophesy there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But prophesy not again any more at Bethel; for it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is the house of the kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Amos answered and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet’s son; but I was a herdman, and a gatherer of sycamore fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Jehovah took me as I followed the flock, and Jehovah said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And now hear thou the word of Jehovah: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and utter not [words] against the house of Isaac.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Thy wife shall be a harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided with the line; and thou shalt die in a land that is unclean; and Israel shall certainly go into captivity, out of his land.</p>
