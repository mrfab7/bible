<chapter book="1 Peter" number="5" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The elders which [are] among you I exhort, who [am their] fellow-elder and witness of the sufferings of the Christ, who also [am] partaker of the glory about to be revealed:</verse>
  <verse number="2">shepherd the flock of God which [is] among you, exercising oversight, not by necessity, but willingly; not for base gain, but readily;</verse>
  <verse number="3">not as lording it over your possessions, but being models for the flock.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And when the chief shepherd is manifested ye shall receive the unfading crown of glory.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Likewise [ye] younger, be subject to [the] elder, and all of you bind on humility towards one another; for God sets himself against [the] proud, but to [the] humble gives grace.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in [the due] time;</verse>
  <verse number="7">having cast all your care upon him, for he cares about you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Be vigilant, watch. Your adversary [the] devil as a roaring lion walks about seeking whom he may devour.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Whom resist, stedfast in faith, knowing that the selfsame sufferings are accomplished in your brotherhood which [is] in [the] world.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But the God of all grace who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, when ye have suffered for a little while, himself shall make perfect, stablish, strengthen, ground:</verse>
  <verse number="11">to him [be] the glory and the might for the ages of the ages. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="12">By Silvanus, the faithful brother, as I suppose, I have written to you briefly; exhorting and testifying that this is [the] true grace of God in which ye stand.</verse>
  <verse number="13">She that is elected with [you] in Babylon salutes you, and Marcus my son.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be with you all who [are] in Christ.</verse>
