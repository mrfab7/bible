<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Dead flies cause the oil of the perfumer to send forth an evil odor; so does a little folly outweigh wisdom and honor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A wise man’s heart is at his right hand, but a fool’s heart at his left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Yes also, when the fool walks by the way, his understanding fails him, and he says to everyone that he is a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If the spirit of the ruler rises up against you, don’t leave your place; for gentleness lays great offenses to rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, the sort of error which proceeds from the ruler.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in a low place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking like servants on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He who digs a pit may fall into it; and whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Whoever carves out stones may be injured by them. Whoever splits wood may be endangered thereby.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If the axe is blunt, and one doesn’t sharpen the edge, then he must use more strength; but skill brings success.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If the snake bites before it is charmed, then is there no profit for the charmer’s tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious; but a fool is swallowed by his own lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness; and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">A fool also multiplies words. Man doesn’t know what will be; and that which will be after him, who can tell him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The labor of fools wearies every one of them; for he doesn’t know how to go to the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Woe to you, land, when your king is a child, and your princes eat in the morning!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Happy are you, land, when your king is the son of nobles, and your princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">By slothfulness the roof sinks in; and through idleness of the hands the house leaks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A feast is made for laughter, and wine makes the life glad; and money is the answer for all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Don’t curse the king, no, not in your thoughts; and don’t curse the rich in your bedroom: for a bird of the sky may carry your voice, and that which has wings may tell the matter.</p>
