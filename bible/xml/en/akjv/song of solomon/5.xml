<chapter book="Song of Solomon" number="5" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yes, drink abundantly, O beloved.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I sleep, but my heart wakes: it is the voice of my beloved that knocks, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</verse>
  <verse number="4">My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, on the handles of the lock.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spoke: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him, that I am sick of love.</verse>
  <verse number="9">What is your beloved more than another beloved, O you fairest among women? what is your beloved more than another beloved, that you do so charge us?</verse>
  <verse number="10">My beloved is white and ruddy, the most chief among ten thousand.</verse>
  <verse number="11">His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven.</verse>
  <verse number="12">His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.</verse>
  <verse number="13">His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.</verse>
  <verse number="14">His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.</verse>
  <verse number="15">His legs are as pillars of marble, set on sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</verse>
  <verse number="16">His mouth is most sweet: yes, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</verse>
