  <verse number="1">But you are to speak the things that befit sound doctrine.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Old men should be sober, chaste, prudent, sound in faith, in love, in patience.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Old women, similarly, should be in holy attire, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teaching well,</verse>
  <verse number="4">so that they may teach prudence to the young women, so that they may love their husbands, love their children,</verse>
  <verse number="5">be sensible, chaste, restrained, have concern for the household, be kind, be subordinate to their husbands: so that the Word of God may be not blasphemed.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Exhort young men similarly, so that they may show self-restraint.</verse>
  <verse number="7">In all things, present yourself as an example of good works: in doctrine, with integrity, with seriousness,</verse>
  <verse number="8">with sound words, irreproachably, so that he who is an opponent may dread that he has nothing evil to say about us.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Exhort servants to be submissive to their masters, in all things pleasing, not contradicting,</verse>
  <verse number="10">not cheating, but in all things showing good fidelity, so that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the grace of God our Savior has appeared to all men,</verse>
  <verse number="12">instructing us to reject impiety and worldly desires, so that we may live soberly and justly and piously in this age,</verse>
  <verse number="13">looking forward to the blessed hope and the advent of the glory of the great God and of our Savior Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He gave himself for our sake, so that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and might cleanse for himself an acceptable people, pursuers of good works.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Speak and exhort and argue these things with all authority. Let no one despise you.</verse>
