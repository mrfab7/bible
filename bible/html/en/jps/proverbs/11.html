<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A false balance is an abomination to the LORD; But a perfect weight is His delight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">When pride cometh, then cometh shame; But with the lowly is wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The integrity of the upright shall guide them; But the perverseness of the faithless shall destroy them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Riches profit not in the day of wrath; But righteousness delivereth from death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The righteousness of the sincere shall make straight his way; But the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them; But the faithless shall be trapped in their own crafty device.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish, And the hope of strength perisheth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The righteous is delivered out of trouble, And the wicked cometh in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">With his mouth the impious man destroyeth his neighbour; But through knowledge shall the righteous be delivered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth; And when the wicked perish, there is joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">By the blessing of the upright a city is exalted; But it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He that despiseth his neighbour lacketh understanding; But a man of discernment holdeth his peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets; But he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth a matter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Where no wise direction is, a people falleth; But in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it; But he that hateth them that strike hands is secure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A gracious woman obtaineth honour; And strong men obtain riches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The merciful man doeth good to his own soul; But he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The wicked earneth deceitful wages; But he that soweth righteousness hath a sure reward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Stedfast righteousness tendeth to life; But he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">They that are perverse in heart are an abomination to the LORD; But such as are upright in their way are His delight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">My hand upon it! the evil man shall not be unpunished; But the seed of the righteous shall escape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">As a ring of gold in a swineâ€™s snout, so is a fair woman that turneth aside from discretion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The desire of the righteous is only good; But the expectation of the wicked is wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; And there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth only to want.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The beneficent soul shall be made rich, and he that satisfieth abundantly shall be satisfied also himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him; But blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He that diligently seeketh good seeketh favour; But he that searcheth for evil, it shall come unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; But the righteous shall flourish as foliage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind; And the foolish shall be servant to the wise of heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; And he that is wise winneth souls.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Behold, the righteous shall be requited in the earth; How much more the wicked and the sinner!</p>
