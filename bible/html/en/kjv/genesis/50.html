<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which [is] beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This [is] a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which [is] beyond Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we [be] thy servants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for [am] I in the place of God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But as for you, ye thought evil against me; [but] God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as [it is] this day, to save much people alive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third [generation]: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph’s knees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">So Joseph died, [being] an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</p>
