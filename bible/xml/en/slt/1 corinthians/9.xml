<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="9" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Am I not sent? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are ye not my work in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="2">If to others I am not sent, but surely I am to you: for the seal of my sending are ye in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="3">My justification to them examining me is this,</verse>
  <verse number="4">have we not power to eat and to drink?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife; as also the rest of the sent, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Or I only and Barnabas, have we not power not to work?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Who makes war at any time at his own charges who plants a vineyard, and eats not of its fruit or who feeds a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Not according to man do I speak these things: or does not the law also say these things?</verse>
  <verse number="9">For in the law of Moses has been written, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox grinding. Is there not care to God for oxen?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Or does he say altogether on account of us? For it was written on account of us: that he ploughing ought to plough upon hope; and he grinding upon hope, to participate with his hope.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If we have sown to you spiritual things, is it great if we shall reap your carnal things?</verse>
  <verse number="12">If others participate with your power, not rather we? But we used not this power; but endure all things, lest we give some hindrance to the good news of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Do ye not know that they working consecrated things, eat of the temple? they working diligently at the altar, share together with the altar?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thus also the Lord appointed to them announcing good news to live of the good news.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But I used none of these things: and I wrote not these things, that thus it might be with me: for good to me rather to die, than that any should render my boasting void.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For if I announce the good news, there is no boasting to me: for necessity is laid upon me; and woe is to me, if I announce not the good news!</verse>
  <verse number="17">For if of free will I do this, I have reward: and if unwillingly, I have been entrusted with a stewardship.</verse>
  <verse number="18">What reward therefore is to me? That announcing good news, I shall make the good news of Christ not expensive, not to make use of my power in the good news.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For being free from all, I have subjected myself to all, that I might gain the more.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And I was to the Jews as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews: to them under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them under the law;</verse>
  <verse number="21">To the lawless, as lawless, (not being lawless to God, but subject to the law to Christ,) that I might gain the lawless,</verse>
  <verse number="22">I became to the weak as weak, that I might gain the weak: I have been all things to all, that altogether I might save some.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And this I do on account of the good news, that I might become a partaker of it.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Do ye not know that they running in a race-course, all truly run, and one receives the prize of combat? Do ye so run, that ye might receive.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And every one contending for the prize, has self command in all things. These surely therefore that they might receive a corruptible crown; and we an incorruptible.</verse>
  <verse number="26">I therefore so run, as not uncertainly; so practise I pugilism, as not laying stripes upon air:</verse>
  <verse number="27">But I give my body a blow under the eyes, and reduce to bondage: lest having proclaimed to others, I myself be rejected.</verse>
