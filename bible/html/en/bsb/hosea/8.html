<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Put the ram’s horn to your lips! An eagle looms over the house of the LORD, because the people have transgressed My covenant and rebelled against My law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Israel cries out to Me, “O our God, we know You!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But Israel has rejected good; an enemy will pursue him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They set up kings, but not by Me. They make princes, but without My approval. With their silver and gold they make themselves idols, to their own destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He has rejected your calf, O Samaria. My anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of innocence?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For this thing is from Israel—a craftsman made it, and it is not God. It will be broken to pieces, that calf of Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For they sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind. There is no standing grain; what sprouts fails to yield flour. Even if it should produce, the foreigners would swallow it up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Israel is swallowed up! Now they are among the nations like a worthless vessel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For they have gone up to Assyria like a wild donkey on its own. Ephraim has hired lovers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Though they hire allies among the nations, I will now round them up, and they will begin to diminish under the oppression of the king of princes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Though Ephraim multiplied the altars for sin, they became his altars for sinning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Though I wrote for them the great things of My law, they regarded them as something strange.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Though they offer sacrifices as gifts to Me, and though they eat the meat, the LORD does not accept them. Now He will remember their iniquity and punish their sins: They will return to Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces; Judah has multiplied its fortified cities. But I will send fire upon their cities, and it will consume their citadels.</p>
