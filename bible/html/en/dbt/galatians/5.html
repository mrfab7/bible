<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Christ has set us free in freedom; stand fast therefore, and be not held again in a yoke of bondage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Behold, I, Paul, say to you, that if ye are circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I witness again to every man [who is] circumcised, that he is debtor to do the whole law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Ye are deprived of all profit from the Christ as separated [from him], as many as are justified by law; ye have fallen from grace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For we, by [the] Spirit, on the principle of faith, await the hope of righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any force, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Ye ran well; who has stopped you that ye should not obey the truth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The persuasibleness [is] not of him that calls you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A little leaven leavens the whole lump.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I have confidence as to you in [the] Lord, that ye will have no other mind; and he that is troubling you shall bear the guilt [of it], whosoever he may be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why am I yet persecuted? Then the scandal of the cross has been done away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I would that they would even cut themselves off who throw you into confusion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For ye have been called to liberty, brethren; only [do] not [turn] liberty into an opportunity to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">but if ye bite and devour one another, see that ye are not consumed one of another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But I say, Walk in [the] Spirit, and ye shall no way fulfil flesh’s lust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these things are opposed one to the other, that ye should not do those things which ye desire;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">but if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, uncleanness, licentiousness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">idolatry, sorcery, hatred, strifes, jealousies, angers, contentions, disputes, schools of opinion,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">envyings, murders, drunkennesses, revels, and things like these; as to which I tell you beforehand, even as I also have said before, that they who do such things shall not inherit God’s kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, fidelity,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">meekness, self-control: against such things there is no law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But they that [are] of the Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If we live by the Spirit, let us walk also by the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Let us not become vain-glorious, provoking one another, envying one another.</p>
