<chapter book="Luke" number="24" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">On the first day of the week, very early in the morning, the women came to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared.</verse>
  <verse number="2">They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,</verse>
  <verse number="3">but when they entered, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="4">While they were puzzling over this, suddenly two men in radiant apparel stood beside them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">As the women bowed their faces to the ground in terror, the two men asked them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead?</verse>
  <verse number="6">He is not here; He has risen! Remember how He told you while He was still in Galilee:</verse>
  <verse number="7">‘The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.’”</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then they remembered His words.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And when they returned from the tomb, they reported all these things to the Eleven and to all the others.</verse>
  <verse number="10">It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But their words seemed like nonsense to them, and they did not believe the women.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. And after bending down and seeing only the linen cloths, he went away, wondering to himself what had happened.</verse>
  <verse number="13">That same day two of them were going to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="14">They were talking with each other about everything that had happened.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And as they talked and deliberated, Jesus Himself came up and walked along with them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But their eyes were kept from recognizing Him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He asked them, “What are you discussing so intently as you walk along?” They stood still, with sadness on their faces.</verse>
  <verse number="18">One of them, named Cleopas, asked Him, “Are You the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in recent days?”</verse>
  <verse number="19">“What things?” He asked. “The events involving Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered. “This man was a prophet, powerful in speech and action before God and all the people.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Our chief priests and rulers delivered Him up to the sentence of death, and they crucified Him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But we were hoping He was the One who would redeem Israel. And besides all this, it is the third day since these things took place.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Furthermore, some of our women astounded us. They were at the tomb early this morning,</verse>
  <verse number="23">but they did not find His body. They came and told us they had seen a vision of angels, who said that Jesus was alive.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had described. But Him they did not see.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then Jesus said to them, “O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!</verse>
  <verse number="26">Was it not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and then to enter His glory?”</verse>
  <verse number="27">And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, He explained to them what was written in all the Scriptures about Himself.</verse>
  <verse number="28">As they approached the village where they were headed, He seemed to be going farther.</verse>
  <verse number="29">But they pleaded with Him, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening and the day is almost over.” So He went in to stay with them.</verse>
  <verse number="30">While He was reclining at the table with them, He took bread, spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to them.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Jesus—and He disappeared from their sight.</verse>
  <verse number="32">They asked each other, “Were not our hearts burning within us as He spoke with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?”</verse>
  <verse number="33">And they got up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem. There they found the Eleven and those with them, gathered together</verse>
  <verse number="34">and saying, “The Lord has indeed risen and has appeared to Simon!”</verse>
  <verse number="35">Then the two told what had happened on the road, and how they had recognized Jesus in the breaking of the bread.</verse>
  <verse number="36">While they were describing these events, Jesus Himself stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.”</verse>
  <verse number="37">But they were startled and frightened, thinking they had seen a spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="38">“Why are you troubled,” Jesus asked, “and why do doubts arise in your hearts?</verse>
  <verse number="39">Look at My hands and My feet. It is I Myself. Touch Me and see—for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.”</verse>
  <verse number="40">And when He had said this, He showed them His hands and feet.</verse>
  <verse number="41">While they were still in disbelief because of their joy and amazement, He asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?”</verse>
  <verse number="42">So they gave Him a piece of broiled fish,</verse>
  <verse number="43">and He took it and ate it in front of them.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Jesus said to them, “These are the words I spoke to you while I was still with you: Everything must be fulfilled that is written about Me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms.”</verse>
  <verse number="45">Then He opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And He told them, “This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,</verse>
  <verse number="47">and in His name repentance and forgiveness of sins will be proclaimed to all nations, beginning in Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="48">You are witnesses of these things.</verse>
  <verse number="49">And behold, I am sending the promise of My Father upon you. But remain in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high.”</verse>
  <verse number="50">When Jesus had led them out as far as Bethany, He lifted up His hands and blessed them.</verse>
  <verse number="51">While He was blessing them, He left them and was carried up into heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="52">And they worshiped Him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
  <verse number="53">praising God continually in the temple.</verse>
