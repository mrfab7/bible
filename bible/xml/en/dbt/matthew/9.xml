  <verse number="1">And going on board the ship, he passed over and came to his own city.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And behold, they brought to him a paralytic, laid upon a bed; and Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, Be of good courage, child; thy sins are forgiven.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And behold, certain of the scribes said to themselves, This [man] blasphemes.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Jesus, seeing their thoughts, said, Why do ye think evil things in your hearts?</verse>
  <verse number="5">For which is easier: to say, Thy sins are forgiven; or to say, Rise up and walk?</verse>
  <verse number="6">But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (then he says to the paralytic,) Rise up, take up thy bed and go to thy house.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he rose up and went to his house.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But the crowds seeing [it], were in fear, and glorified God who gave such power to men.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Jesus, passing on thence, saw a man sitting at the tax-office, called Matthew, and says to him, Follow me. And he rose up and followed him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And it came to pass, as he lay at table in the house, that behold, many tax-gatherers and sinners came and lay at table with Jesus and his disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the Pharisees seeing [it], said to his disciples, Why does your teacher eat with tax-gatherers and sinners?</verse>
  <verse number="12">But [Jesus] hearing it, said, They that are strong have not need of a physician, but those that are ill.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But go and learn what [that] is—I will have mercy and not sacrifice; for I have not come to call righteous [men] but sinners.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then come to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees often fast, but thy disciples fast not?</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Jesus said to them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn so long as the bridegroom is with them? But days will come when the bridegroom will have been taken away from them, and then they will fast.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But no one puts a patch of new cloth on an old garment, for its filling up takes from the garment and a worse rent takes place.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Nor do men put new wine into old skins, otherwise the skins burst and the wine is poured out, and the skins will be destroyed; but they put new wine into new skins, and both are preserved together.</verse>
  <verse number="18">As he spoke these things to them, behold, a ruler coming in did homage to him, saying, My daughter has by this died; but come and lay thy hand upon her and she shall live.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Jesus rose up and followed him, and [so did] his disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And behold, a woman, who had had a bloody flux [for] twelve years, came behind and touched the hem of his garment;</verse>
  <verse number="21">for she said within herself, If I should only touch his garment I shall be healed.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But Jesus turning and seeing her, said, Be of good courage, daughter; thy faith has healed thee. And the woman was healed from that hour.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And when Jesus was come to the house of the ruler, and saw the flute-players and the crowd making a tumult,</verse>
  <verse number="24">he said, Withdraw, for the damsel is not dead, but sleeps. And they derided him.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But when the crowd had been put out, he went in and took her hand; and the damsel rose up.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the fame of it went out into all that land.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And as Jesus passed on thence, two blind [men] followed him, crying and saying, Have mercy on us, Son of David.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And when he was come to the house, the blind [men] came to him. And Jesus says to them, Do ye believe that I am able to do this? They say to him, Yea, Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith, be it unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And their eyes were opened; and Jesus charged them sharply, saying, See, let no man know it.</verse>
  <verse number="31">But they, when they were gone out, spread his name abroad in all that land.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But as these were going out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed by a demon.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And the demon having been cast out, the dumb spake. And the crowds were astonished, saying, It has never been seen thus in Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="34">But the Pharisees said, He casts out the demons through the prince of the demons.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And Jesus went round all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every bodily weakness.</verse>
  <verse number="36">But when he saw the crowds he was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed, and cast away as sheep not having a shepherd.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Then saith he to his disciples, The harvest [is] great and the workmen [are] few;</verse>
  <verse number="38">supplicate therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth workmen unto his harvest.</verse>
