  <verse number="1">When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what [is] before thee:</verse>
  <verse number="2">And put a knife to thy throat, if thou [be] a man given to appetite.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Be not desirous of his dainties: for they [are] deceitful meat.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for [riches] certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Eat thou not the bread of [him that hath] an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:</verse>
  <verse number="7">For as he thinketh in his heart, so [is] he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart [is] not with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The morsel [which] thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:</verse>
  <verse number="11">For their redeemer [is] mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Withhold not correction from the child: for [if] thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.</verse>
  <verse number="15">My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Let not thine heart envy sinners: but [be thou] in the fear of the LORD all the day long.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:</verse>
  <verse number="21">For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe [a man] with rags.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Buy the truth, and sell [it] not; [also] wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise [child] shall have joy of him.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.</verse>
  <verse number="26">My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For a whore [is] a deep ditch; and a strange woman [is] a narrow pit.</verse>
  <verse number="28">She also lieth in wait as [for] a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?</verse>
  <verse number="30">They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, [when] it moveth itself aright.</verse>
  <verse number="32">At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.</verse>
  <verse number="35">They have stricken me, [shalt thou say, and] I was not sick; they have beaten me, [and] I felt [it] not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.</verse>
