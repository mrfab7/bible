<chapter book="1 Timothy" number="4" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But the Spirit saith expressly, that in later times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils,</verse>
  <verse number="2">through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron;</verse>
  <verse number="3">forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by them that believe and know the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving:</verse>
  <verse number="5">for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.</verse>
  <verse number="6">If thou put the brethren in mind of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which thou hast followed until now:</verse>
  <verse number="7">but refuse profane and old wives’ fables. And exercise thyself unto godliness:</verse>
  <verse number="8">for bodily exercise is profitable for a little; but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life which now is, and of that which is to come.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For to this end we labour and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of them that believe.</verse>
  <verse number="11">These things command and teach.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an ensample to them that believe, in word, in manner of life, in love, in faith, in purity.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Till I come, give heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Be diligent in these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy progress may be manifest unto all.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Take heed to thyself, and to thy teaching. Continue in these things; for in doing this thou shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee.</verse>
