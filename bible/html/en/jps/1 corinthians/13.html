<p class="verse" data-verse="1">If I can speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but am destitute of Love, I have but become a loud-sounding trumpet or a clanging cymbal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">If I possess the gift of prophecy and am versed in all mysteries and all knowledge, and have such absolute faith that I can remove mountains, but am destitute of Love, I am nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And if I distribute all my possessions to the poor, and give up my body to be burned, but am destitute of Love, it profits me nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Love is patient and kind. Love knows neither envy nor jealousy. Love is not forward and self-assertive, nor boastful and conceited.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">She does not behave unbecomingly, nor seek to aggrandize herself, nor blaze out in passionate anger, nor brood over wrongs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">She finds no pleasure in injustice done to others, but joyfully sides with the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">She knows how to be silent. She is full of trust, full of hope, full of patient endurance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Love never fails. But if there are prophecies, they will be done away with; if there are languages, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be brought to an end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For our knowledge is imperfect, and so is our prophesying;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">but when the perfect state of things is come, all that is imperfect will be brought to an end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">When I was a child, I talked like a child, felt like a child, reasoned like a child: when I became a man, I put from me childish ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For the present we see things as if in a mirror, and are puzzled; but then we shall see them face to face. For the present the knowledge I gain is imperfect; but then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And so there remain Faith, Hope, Loveâ€”these three; and of these the greatest is Love.</p>
