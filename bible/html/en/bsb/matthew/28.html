<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Suddenly there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, rolled away the stone, and sat on it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The guards trembled in fear of him and became like dead men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He is not here; He has risen, just as He said! Come, see the place where He lay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Then go quickly and tell His disciples, ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see Him.’ See, I have told you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">So they hurried away from the tomb in fear and great joy, and ran to tell His disciples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Suddenly Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” They came to Him, grasped His feet, and worshiped Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">“Do not be afraid,” said Jesus. “Go and tell My brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see Me.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And after the chief priests had met with the elders and formed a plan, they gave the soldiers a large sum of money</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and instructed them: “You are to say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If this report reaches the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">So the guards took the money and did as they were instructed. And this account has been circulated among the Jews to this very day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Meanwhile, the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain Jesus had designated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">When they saw Him, they worshiped Him, but some doubted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then Jesus came to them and said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">and teaching them to obey all that I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”</p>
