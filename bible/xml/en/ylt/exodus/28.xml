  <verse number="1">And thou, bring thou near unto thee Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him, from the midst of the sons of Israel, for his being priest to Me, even Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, sons of Aaron;</verse>
  <verse number="2">and thou hast made holy garments for Aaron thy brother, for honour and for beauty;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and thou—thou dost speak unto all the wise of heart, whom I have filled with a spirit of wisdom, and they have made the garments of Aaron to sanctify him for his being priest to Me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And these are the garments which they make: a breastplate, and an ephod, and an upper robe, and an embroidered coat, a mitre, and a girdle; yea, they have made holy garments for Aaron thy brother, and for his sons, for his being priest to Me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">‘And they take the gold, and the blue, and the purple, and the scarlet, and the linen,</verse>
  <verse number="6">and have made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen, work of a designer;</verse>
  <verse number="7">it hath two shoulders joining at its two ends, and it is joined.</verse>

  <verse number="15">‘And thou hast made a breastplate of judgment, work of a designer; according to the work of the ephod thou dost make it; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen thou dost make it;</verse>
  <verse number="16">it is square, doubled, a span its length, and a span its breadth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And thou hast set in it settings of stone, four rows of stone; a row of sardius, topaz, and carbuncle is the first row;</verse>
  <verse number="18">and the second row is emerald, sapphire, and diamond;</verse>
  <verse number="19">and the third row is opal, agate, and amethyst;</verse>
  <verse number="20">and the fourth row is beryl, and onyx, and jasper; embroidered with gold are they in their settings,</verse>
  <verse number="21">and the stones are according to the names of the sons of Israel, twelve, according to their names, openings of a signet, each by his name are they for the twelve tribes.</verse>
  <verse number="22">‘And thou hast made on the breastplate wreathed chains, work of thick bands, of pure gold;</verse>
  <verse number="23">and thou hast made on the breastplate two rings of gold, and hast put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate;</verse>
  <verse number="24">and thou hast put the two thick bands of gold on the two rings at the ends of the breastplate;</verse>
  <verse number="25">and the two ends of the two thick bands thou dost put on the two embroidered things, and thou hast put them on the shoulders of the ephod over-against its face.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And thou hast made two rings of gold, and hast set them on the two ends of the breastplate, on its border, which is over-against the ephod within;</verse>
  <verse number="27">and thou hast made two rings of gold, and hast put them on the two shoulders of the ephod, beneath, over-against its front, over-against its joining, above the girdle of the ephod,</verse>
  <verse number="28">and they bind the breastplate by its rings unto the rings of the ephod with a ribbon of blue, to be above the girdle of the ephod, and the breastplate is not loosed from the ephod.</verse>

  <verse number="31">‘And thou hast made the upper robe of the ephod completely of blue,</verse>
  <verse number="32">and the opening for its head hath been in its midst, a border is to its opening round about, work of a weaver, as the opening of a habergeon there is to it; it is not rent.</verse>
  <verse number="33">‘And thou hast made on its hem pomegranates of blue, and purple, and scarlet, on its hem round about, and bells of gold in their midst round about;</verse>
  <verse number="34">a bell of gold and a pomegranate, a bell of gold and a pomegranate are on the hems of the upper robe round about.</verse>

  <verse number="36">‘And thou hast made a flower of pure gold, and hast opened on it—openings of a signet—‘Holy to Jehovah;’</verse>
  <verse number="37">and thou hast put it on a blue ribbon, and it hath been on the mitre—over-against the front of the mitre it is;</verse>
  <verse number="38">and it hath been on the forehead of Aaron, and Aaron hath borne the iniquity of the holy things which the sons of Israel do hallow, even all their holy gifts; and it hath been on his forehead continually for a pleasing thing for them before Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="39">‘And thou hast embroidered the coat of linen, and hast made a mitre of linen, and a girdle thou dost make—work of an embroiderer.</verse>

  <verse number="41">and thou hast clothed Aaron thy brother with them, and his sons with him, and hast anointed them, and hast consecrated their hand, and hast sanctified them, and they have been priests to Me.</verse>
  <verse number="42">‘And make thou for them linen trousers to cover the naked flesh: they are from the loins even unto the thighs;</verse>
  <verse number="43">and they have been on Aaron and on his sons, in their going in unto the tent of meeting, or in their drawing nigh unto the altar to minister in the sanctuary, and they do not bear iniquity nor have they died; a statute age-during to him, and to his seed after him.</verse>
