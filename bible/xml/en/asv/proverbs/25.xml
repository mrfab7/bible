  <verse number="1">These also are proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.</verse>
  <verse number="2">It is the glory of God to conceal a thing; But the glory of kings is to search out a matter.</verse>
  <verse number="3">As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth, So the heart of kings is unsearchable.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Take away the dross from the silver, And there cometh forth a vessel for the refiner:</verse>
  <verse number="5">Take away the wicked from before the king, And his throne shall be established in righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Put not thyself forward in the presence of the king, And stand not in the place of great men:</verse>
  <verse number="7">For better is it that it be said unto thee, Come up hither, Than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince, Whom thine eyes have seen.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Go not forth hastily to strive, Lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, When thy neighbor hath put thee to shame.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Debate thy cause with thy neighbor himself, And disclose not the secret of another;</verse>
  <verse number="10">Lest he that heareth it revile thee, And thine infamy turn not away.</verse>
  <verse number="11">A word fitly spoken Is like apples of gold in network of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="12">As an ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, So is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.</verse>
  <verse number="13">As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, So is a faithful messenger to them that send him; For he refresheth the soul of his masters.</verse>
  <verse number="14">As clouds and wind without rain, So is he that boasteth himself of his gifts falsely.</verse>
  <verse number="15">By long forbearing is a ruler persuaded, And a soft tongue breaketh the bone.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, Lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Let thy foot be seldom in thy neighbor’s house, Lest he be weary of thee, and hate thee.</verse>
  <verse number="18">A man that beareth false witness against his neighbor Is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble Is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.</verse>
  <verse number="20">As one that taketh off a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon soda, So is he that singeth songs to a heavy heart.</verse>
  <verse number="21">If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; And if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:</verse>
  <verse number="22">For thou wilt heap coals of fire upon his head, And Jehovah will reward thee.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The north wind bringeth forth rain: So doth a backbiting tongue an angry countenance.</verse>
  <verse number="24">It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, Than with a contentious woman in a wide house.</verse>
  <verse number="25">As cold waters to a thirsty soul, So is good news from a far country.</verse>
  <verse number="26">As a troubled fountain, and a corrupted spring, So is a righteous man that giveth way before the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="27">It is not good to eat much honey: So for men to search out their own glory is grievous.</verse>
  <verse number="28">He whose spirit is without restraint Is like a city that is broken down and without walls.</verse>
