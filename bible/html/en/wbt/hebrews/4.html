<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Let us therefore fear, lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For to us was the gospel preached, as well as to them: but the word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For we who have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God rested the seventh day from all his works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter into it, and they to whom it was first preached entered not because of unbelief:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">(Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To-day, after so long a time; as it is said, To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For if Jesus had given them rest, then he would not afterward have spoken of another day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For he that hath entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For the word of God is living, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Seeing then that we have a great High Priest, that hath passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For we have not a high priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but who was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</p>
