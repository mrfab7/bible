<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And in that day Jesus, having come out of the house, sat by the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And many crowds were assembled together to him; therefore having entered into the ship, he sat down, and all the crowd stood upon the sea-shore.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he spake to them many things in parables, saying, Behold, he, the sower, went forth to sow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And in his sowing some truly fell by the way, and the flying things came and swallowed them down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And others fell upon rocky places where it had not much earth, and quickly it sprang forth, for it had no depth of earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the sun having risen, it was parched up; and for the not having a root, it was dried up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And others fell among thorns, and the thorns came up and choked them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And others fell upon good earth and gave fruit, some truly a hundred, and some sixty, and some thirty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He having ears to hear let him hear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the disciples having come near, said to him, Why speakest thou to them in parables?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And having answered, he said to them, For to you it was given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it was not given.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For whoever has shall be given to him, and he shall have in excess; and whoever has not, also what he has shall be taken away from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For this I speak to them in parables: for seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And the prophecy of Esaias is filled up in them, saying, In hearing shall ye hear, and not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For the heart of this people has been thickened, and with their ears have they heard heavily, and their eyes have they closed; lest perhaps they should see with the eyes, and hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and turn back, and I should heal them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But happy your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they hear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For verily I say to you, that many prophets and just desired eagerly to see what ye see, and saw not; and to hear what ye hear, and heard not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Therefore hear ye the parable of him sowing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Every one hearing, and not understanding, the evil one comes, and carries off that sown in his heart. This is he having sown by the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And he having sown upon rocky places, this is he hearing the word, and quickly with joy receiving it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And has no root in himself, but is for a time; and there being pressure or expulsion for the word, straightly is he offended.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And he having sown among thorns, this is he hearing the word; and the care of this time, and the deceit of riches, choke the word, and it is unfruitful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But he having sown upon good earth is he hearing the word, and understanding; who indeed bears fruit, and who makes truly a hundred, and who sixty, and who thirty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens was made like a man sowing good seed in his field:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And in menâ€™s sleeping, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat, and went away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And when the grass sprouted up and made fruit, then appeared the tares also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And the servants of the master of the house having come, said to him, Lord, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field whence therefore has it tares?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And he said to them, A man, an enemy, has done this: and his servants said to him, Wilt thou therefore we, having departed, should gather them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And he said, No; lest gathering the tares, ye root up the wheat together with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Suffer both to grow together till harvest; and in time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; and gather the wheat into my barn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Another parable set he before them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like a kernel of mustard, which a man taking, sowed in his field:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Which truly is less than all seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than vegetables, and becomes a tree, so that the flying things of heaven come and lodge in its young shoots.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Another parable spake he to them; The kingdom of the heavens is like to leaven, which a woman having taken, hid in three measures of wheaten flour, till the whole was leavened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">All these things spake Jesus in parables to the crowds; and without a parable spake he not to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">So that that spoken by the prophet might be filled up; saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will declare things having been hid from the foundation of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Then Jesus having dismissed the crowds, went into the house; and his disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the tares of the field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And he having answered, said to them, He sowing the good seed is the Son of man:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And the field is the world; and the good seed, these are the sons of the kingdom; and the tares are the sons of the evil one;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And the enemy having sowed them is the devil; and the harvest is the end of time; and the reapers are the messengers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">As therefore the tares are gathered together and burnt in fire; so shall it be in the end of this time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">The Son of man shall send forth his messengers, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all scandals, and those doing iniquity;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And they shall cast them into a furnace of fire; there shall there be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">Then shall the just emit a brilliant light as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He having ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like to a treasure hid in the field; which a man finding, concealed, and from his joy, he retires, and all things which he has he sells, and he purchases that field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like to a man, a wholesale merchant, seeking beautiful pearls:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">Who, finding one pearl of great value, having departed, he sold all things which he had, and purchased it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like to a large sweep-net, cast into the sea, and having gathered of every kind:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">Which when it was filled, having raised up upon the shore, and having set down, they gathered the good things into vessels, and the rotten things they cast without.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">So shall it be in the end of time; the messengers shall come forth, and separate the evil from the midst of the just,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">And they shall cast them into a furnace of fire; there shall there be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">Jesus says to them, Have ye understood all these? They say to him, Yes, Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">And he said to them, Therefore every scribe, having been a disciple in the kingdom of the heavens, is like to a man, master of a house, who casts out from his treasure new things and old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">And it was when Jesus finished these parables, he removed thence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">And having come into his native land, he taught them in their assembly, so that they were struck with amazement, and said, Whence to him this wisdom, and powers?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">Is not this the son of the carpenter? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then to him all these?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="57">And they were scandalized in him. And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not unhonoured, except in his native land, and in his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="58">And he did not many powers there, because of their unbelief.</p>
