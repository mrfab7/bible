  <verse number="2">He was sixteen years old when he had begun to reign, and he reigned for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he did what was pleasing before the Lord, in accord with all that his father, Amaziah, did.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Yet truly, he did not demolish the high places. And still the people were sacrificing, and burning incense, in the high places.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now the Lord struck the king, and he became a leper, even until the day of his death. And he was living in a separate house by himself. And truly, Jotham, the son of the king, governed the palace, and he judged the people of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now the rest of the words of Azariah, and all that he did, have these not been written in the book of the words of the days of the kings of Judah?</verse>
