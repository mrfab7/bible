<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Bildad the Shuhite answered,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“How long will you hunt for words? Consider, and afterwards we will speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Why are we counted as animals, which have become unclean in your sight?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">You who tear yourself in your anger, shall the earth be forsaken for you? Or shall the rock be removed out of its place?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">“Yes, the light of the wicked shall be put out, The spark of his fire shall not shine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The light shall be dark in his tent. His lamp above him shall be put out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The steps of his strength shall be shortened. His own counsel shall cast him down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he wanders into its mesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A snare will take him by the heel. A trap will catch him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A noose is hidden for him in the ground, a trap for him in the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall chase him at his heels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">His strength shall be famished. Calamity shall be ready at his side.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The members of his body shall be devoured. The firstborn of death shall devour his members.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He shall be rooted out of his tent where he trusts. He shall be brought to the king of terrors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his. Sulfur shall be scattered on his habitation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">His roots shall be dried up beneath. Above shall his branch be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">His memory shall perish from the earth. He shall have no name in the street.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He shall have neither son nor grandson among his people, nor any remaining where he lived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Those who come after shall be astonished at his day, as those who went before were frightened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous. This is the place of him who doesn’t know God.”</p>
