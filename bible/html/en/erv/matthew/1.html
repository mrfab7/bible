<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judah and his brethren;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and Judah begat Perez and Zerah of Tamar; and Perez begat Hezron; and Hezron begat Ram;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and Ram begat Amminadab; and Amminadab begat Nahshon; and Nahshon begat Salmon;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab; and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and Jesse begat David the king. And David begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Uriah;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and Solomon begat Rehoboam; and Rehoboam begat Abijah; and Abijah begat Asa;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">and Asa begat Jehoshaphat; and Jehoshaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Uzziah;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and Uzziah begat Jotham; and Jotham begat Ahaz; and Ahaz begat Hezekiah;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and Hezekiah begat Manasseh; and Manasseh begat Amon; and Amon begat Josiah;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and Josiah begat Jechoniah and his brethren, at the time of the carrying away to Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And after the carrying away to Babylon, Jechoniah begat Shealtiel; and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and Zerubbabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">and Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">So all the generations from Abraham unto David are fourteen generations; and from David unto the carrying away to Babylon fourteen generations; and from the carrying away to Babylon unto the Christ fourteen generations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privily.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But when he thought on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And she shall bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name JESUS; for it is he that shall save his people from their sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Now all this is come to pass, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, And they shall call his name Immanuel; which is, being interpreted, God with us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Joseph arose from his sleep, and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto him his wife;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">and knew her not till she had brought forth a son: and he called his name JESUS.</p>
