  <verse number="1">AND the whole multitude of them rising up, led him to Pilate.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And they began to accuse him, saying: We have found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he is Christ the king.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Pilate asked him, saying: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, said: Thou sayest it.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Pilate said to the chief priests and to the multitudes: I find no cause in this man.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But they were more earnest, saying: He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the man were of Galilee?</verse>
  <verse number="7">And when he understood that he was of Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him away to Herod, who was also himself at Jerusalem, in those days.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Herod, seeing Jesus, was very glad; for he was desirous of a long time to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some sign wrought by him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he questioned him in many words. But he answered him nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the chief priests and the scribes stood by, earnestly accusing him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Herod with his army set him at nought, and mocked him, putting on him a white garment, and sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Herod and Pilate were made friends, that same day; for before they were enemies one to another.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Pilate, calling together the chief priests, and the magistrates, and the people,</verse>
  <verse number="14">Said to them: You have presented unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people; and behold I, having examined him before you, find no cause in this man, in those things wherein you accuse him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">No, nor Herod neither. For I sent you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I will chastise him therefore, and release him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Now of necessity he was to release unto them one upon the feast day.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But the whole multitude together cried out, saying: Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:</verse>
  <verse number="19">Who, for a certain sedition made in the city, and for a murder, was cast into prison.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Pilate again spoke to them, desiring to release Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But they cried again, saying: Crucify him, crucify him.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he said to them the third time: Why, what evil hath this man done? I find no cause of death in him. I will chastise him therefore, and let him go.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified; and their voices prevailed.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he released unto them him who for murder and sedition, had been cast into prison, whom they had desired; but Jesus he delivered up to their will.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And as they led him away, they laid hold of one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country; and they laid the cross on him to carry after Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And there followed him a great multitude of people, and of women, who bewailed and lamented him.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But Jesus turning to them, said: Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not over me; but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For behold, the days shall come, wherein they will say: Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that have not borne, and the paps that have not given suck.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Then shall they begin to say to the mountains: Fall upon us; and to the hills: Cover us.</verse>
  <verse number="31">For if in the green wood they do these things, what shall be done in the dry?</verse>
  <verse number="32">And there were also two other malefactors led with him to be put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, they crucified him there; and the robbers, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Jesus said: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. But they, dividing his garments, cast lots.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the people stood beholding, and the rulers with them derided him, saying: He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the elect of God.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</verse>
  <verse number="37">And saying: If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And there was also a superscription written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And one of those robbers who were hanged, blasphemed him, saying: If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</verse>
  <verse number="40">But the other answering, rebuked him, saying: Neither dost thou fear God, seeing thou art condemned under the same condemnation?</verse>
  <verse number="41">And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man hath done no evil.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And he said to Jesus: Lord, remember me when thou shalt come into thy kingdom.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee, this day thou shalt be with me in paradise.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And it was almost the sixth hour; and there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And Jesus crying out with a loud voice, said: Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit. And saying this, he gave up the ghost.</verse>
  <verse number="47">Now the centurion, seeing what was done, glorified God, saying: Indeed this was a just man.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And all the multitude of them that were come together to that sight, and saw the things that were done, returned striking their breasts.</verse>
  <verse number="49">And all his acquaintance, and the women that had followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</verse>
  <verse number="50">And behold there was a man named Joseph, who was a counsellor, a good and just man,</verse>
  <verse number="51">(The same had not consented to their counsel and doings;) of Arimathea, a city of Judea; who also himself looked for the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="52">This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="53">And taking him down, he wrapped him in fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre that was hewed in stone, wherein never yet any man had been laid.</verse>
  <verse number="54">And it was the day of the Parasceve, and the sabbath drew on.</verse>
  <verse number="55">And the women that were come with him from Galilee, following after, saw the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</verse>
  <verse number="56">And returning, they prepared spices and ointments; and on the sabbath day they rested, according to the commandment.</verse>
