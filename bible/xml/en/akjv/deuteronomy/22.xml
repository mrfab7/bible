<chapter book="Deuteronomy" number="22" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">You shall not see your brother’s ox or his sheep go astray, and hide yourself from them: you shall in any case bring them again to your brother.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And if your brother be not near to you, or if you know him not, then you shall bring it to your own house, and it shall be with you until your brother seek after it, and you shall restore it to him again.</verse>
  <verse number="3">In like manner shall you do with his ass; and so shall you do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of your brother’s, which he has lost, and you have found, shall you do likewise: you may not hide yourself.</verse>
  <verse number="4">You shall not see your brother’s ass or his ox fall down by the way, and hide yourself from them: you shall surely help him to lift them up again.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The woman shall not wear that which pertains to a man, neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment: for all that do so are abomination to the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="6">If a bird’s nest chance to be before you in the way in any tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you shall not take the dam with the young:</verse>
  <verse number="7">But you shall in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to you; that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days.</verse>
  <verse number="8">When you build a new house, then you shall make a battlement for your roof, that you bring not blood on your house, if any man fall from there.</verse>
  <verse number="9">You shall not sow your vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of your seed which you have sown, and the fruit of your vineyard, be defiled.</verse>
  <verse number="10">You shall not plow with an ox and an ass together.</verse>
  <verse number="11">You shall not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woolen and linen together.</verse>
  <verse number="12">You shall make you fringes on the four quarters of your clothing, with which you cover yourself.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If any man take a wife, and go in to her, and hate her,</verse>
  <verse number="14">And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil name on her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid:</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel’s virginity to the elders of the city in the gate:</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the damsel’s father shall say to the elders, I gave my daughter to this man to wife, and he hates her;</verse>
  <verse number="17">And, see, he has given occasions of speech against her, saying, I found not your daughter a maid; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;</verse>
  <verse number="19">And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and give them to the father of the damsel, because he has brought up an evil name on a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel:</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she has worked folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father’s house: so shall you put evil away from among you.</verse>
  <verse number="22">If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shall you put away evil from Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed to an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city, and you shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he has humbled his neighbor’s wife: so you shall put away evil from among you.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die.</verse>
  <verse number="26">But to the damsel you shall do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man rises against his neighbor, and slays him, even so is this matter:</verse>
  <verse number="27">For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to save her.</verse>
  <verse number="28">If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;</verse>
  <verse number="29">Then the man that lay with her shall give to the damsel’s father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he has humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.</verse>
  <verse number="30">A man shall not take his father’s wife, nor discover his father’s skirt.</verse>
