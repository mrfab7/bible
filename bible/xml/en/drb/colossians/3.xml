  <verse number="1">Therefore, if you be risen with Christ, seek the things that are above; where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Mind the things that are above, not the things that are upon the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For you are dead; and your life is hid with Christ in God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">When Christ shall appear, who is your life, then you also shall appear with him in glory.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, lust, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is the service of idols.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For which things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of unbelief,</verse>
  <verse number="7">In which you also walked some time, when you lived in them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But now put you also all away: anger, indignation, malice, blasphemy, filthy speech out of your mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Lie not one to another: stripping yourselves of the old man with his deeds,</verse>
  <verse number="10">And putting on the new, him who is renewed unto knowledge, according to the image of him that created him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Where there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free. But Christ is all, and in all.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Put ye on therefore, as the elect of God, holy, and beloved, the bowels of mercy, benignity, humility, modesty, patience:</verse>
  <verse number="13">Bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if any have a complaint against another: even as the Lord hath forgiven you, so do you also.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But above all these things have charity, which is the bond of perfection:</verse>
  <verse number="15">And let the peace of Christ rejoice in your hearts, wherein also you are called in one body: and be ye thankful.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Let the word of Christ dwell in you abundantly, in all wisdom: teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual canticles, singing in grace in your hearts to God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">All whatsoever you do in word or in work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Wives, be subject to your husbands, as it behoveth in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter towards them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Fathers, provoke not your children to indignation, lest they be discouraged.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not serving to the eye, as pleasing men, but in simplicity of heart, fearing God.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Whatsoever you do, do it from the heart, as to the Lord, and not to men:</verse>
  <verse number="24">Knowing that you shall receive of the Lord the reward of inheritance. Serve ye the Lord Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For he that doth wrong, shall receive for that which he hath done wrongfully: and there is no respect of persons with God.</verse>
