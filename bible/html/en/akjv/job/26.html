<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How have you helped him that is without power? how save you the arm that has no strength?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">How have you counceled him that has no wisdom? and how have you plentifully declared the thing as it is?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To whom have you uttered words? and whose spirit came from you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Hell is naked before him, and destruction has no covering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He stretches out the north over the empty place, and hangs the earth on nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He binds up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He holds back the face of his throne, and spreads his cloud on it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He has compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He divides the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smites through the proud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">By his spirit he has garnished the heavens; his hand has formed the crooked serpent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">See, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?</p>
