  <verse number="1">In that time Abijah son of Jeroboam was sick.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Jeroboam will say to his wife, Arise, now, and change thyself, and they will not know that thou art the wife of Jeroboam; and go to Shiloh: behold there Ahijah the prophet; he spake concerning me for king over this people.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And take in thy hand ten of bread and crumb cakes, and a bottle of honey, and go to him: he will announce to thee what will be to the boy.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Jeroboam’s wife will do so, and she will rise and go to Shiloh, and she will come into the house of Ahijah. And Ahijah will not be able to see; for his eyes stood from his old age.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Jehovah said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam coming to seek word from thee for her son, for he was sick: according this and according to this shalt thou speak to her: and it will be as she comes, and she dissembles.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And it will be when Ahijah heard the voice of her feet coming into the door, and he will say, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; wherefore this thou dissemblest? and I send to thee hard things.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Go say to Jeroboam, Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, Because I raised thee up from the midst of the people, and I will give thee chief over my people Israel,</verse>
  <verse number="8">And I will rend the kingdom from the house of David, and I will give it to thee: and thou wert not as my servant David who watched my commands and who went after me with all his heart to do only the straight in mine eyes;</verse>
  <verse number="9">And thou wilt be evil doing above all who were before thee: and thou wilt go and make to thee other gods, and molten things to irritate me, and didst cast me behind thy back.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For this, behold me bringing evil to the house of Jeroboam, and I cut off to Jeroboam him pissing against the wall, the shut up and the forsaken in Israel, and I took away after the house of Jeroboam as dung shall be taken away till its finishing.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Him dying to Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him dying in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat: for Jehovah spake.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And arise, thou, go to thy house: in the coming of thy feet to the city and the child died.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And all Israel mourned for him, and they buried him: for this alone to Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because there was found in him a good word to Jehovah God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Jehovah raised up to him a king over Israel who will cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: and what? also now.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Jehovah smote Israel as a reed will be shaken in the water, and he plucked up Israel from this good land which he gave to their fathers, and he scattered them from beyond the river, because they made their images, irritating Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he will give up Israel on account of the sins of Jeroboam who sinned, and who caused Israel to sin.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Jeroboam’s wife will arise and go, and come to Tirzah: she came upon the threshold of the house, and the boy died.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And they will bury him; and all Israel will mourn for him according to the word of Jehovah which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the remainder of the words of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold them written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the days which Jeroboam reigned, twenty and two years, and he will lie down with his fathers; and Nadab his son will reign in his stead.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Rehoboam son of Solomon reigned in Judah. The son of forty and one years was Rehoboam in his reigning; and seventeen years he reigned in Jerusalem, the city that Jehovah chose to put his name there from all the tribes of Israel: and the name of his mother Naamah, the Ammonitess.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Judah will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, and they will provoke him to jealousy above all which their fathers did in the sins which they sinned.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they will also build to them heights and statues, and pillars, upon every high hill, and, under every green tree.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And also there was a holy place in the land; and they did according to all the abominations of the nations that Jehovah dispossessed from the face of the sons of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And it will be in the fifth year to king Rehoboam, Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And he will take the treasures of the house of Jehovah and the treasures of the king’s house; and he took all: and he took all the shields of gold which Solomon made.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And king Rehoboam will make in their stead shields of brass, and appointed upon the hand of the chief of the runners watching the door of the house of the king.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And it will be whenever the king went to the house of Jehovah, the runners will lift them up and they turned them back to the runner’s chamber.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And the remainder of the words of Rehoboam, and all which he did, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Judah?</verse>
  <verse number="30">And war was between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And Rehoboam will lie down with his fathers and be buried with his fathers in the city of David. And the name of his mother, Naamah, the Ammonitess. And Abijam will reign in his stead.</verse>
