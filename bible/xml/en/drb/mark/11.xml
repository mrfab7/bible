  <verse number="1">AND when they were drawing near to Jerusalem and to Bethania at the mount of Olives, he sendeth two of his disciples,</verse>
  <verse number="2">And saith to them: Go into the village that is over against you, and immediately at your coming in thither, you shall find a colt tied, upon which no man yet hath sat: loose him, and bring him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And if any man shall say to you, What are you doing? say ye that the Lord hath need of him: and immediately he will let him come hither.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And going their way, they found the colt tied before the gate without, in the meeting of two ways: and they loose him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And some of them that stood there, said to them: What do you loosing the colt?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Who said to them as Jesus had commanded them; and they let him go with them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they brought the colt to Jesus; and they lay their garments on him, and he sat upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down boughs from the trees, and strewed them in the way.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they that went before and they that followed, cried, saying: Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Blessed be the kingdom of our father David that cometh: Hosanna in the highest.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he entered into Jerusalem, into the temple: and having viewed all things round about, when now the eventide was come, he went out to Bethania with the twelve.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the next day when they came out from Bethania, he was hungry.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And when he had seen afar off a fig tree having leaves, he came if perhaps he might find any thing on it. And when he was come to it, he found nothing but leaves. For it was not the time for figs.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And answering he said to it: May no man hereafter eat fruit of thee any more for ever. And his disciples heard it.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And they came to Jerusalem. And when he was entered into the temple, he began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the chairs of them that sold doves.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he suffered not that any man should carry a vessel through the temple;</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he taught, saying to them: Is it not written, My house shall be called the house of prayer to all nations? But you have made it a den of thieves.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Which when the chief priests and the scribes had heard, they sought how they might destroy him. For they feared him, because the whole multitude was in admiration at his doctrine.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And when evening was come, he went forth out of the city.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And when they passed by in the morning they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Peter remembering, said to him: Rabbi, behold the fig tree, which thou didst curse, is withered away.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Jesus answering, saith to them: Have the faith of God.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Amen I say to you, that whosoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed and be cast into the sea, and shall not stagger in his heart, but believe, that whatsoever he saith shall be done; it shall be done unto him.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore I say unto you, all things, whatsoever you ask when ye pray, believe that you shall receive; and they shall come unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And when you shall stand to pray, forgive, if you have aught against any man; that your Father also, who is in heaven, may forgive you your sins.</verse>
  <verse number="26">But if you will not forgive, neither will your Father that is in heaven, forgive you your sins.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And they come again to Jerusalem. And when he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests and the scribes and the ancients,</verse>
  <verse number="28">And they say to him: By what authority dost thou these things? and who hath given thee this authority that thou shouldst do these things?</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Jesus answering, said to them: I will also ask you one word, and answer you me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
  <verse number="30">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? Answer me.</verse>
  <verse number="31">But they thought with themselves, saying: If we say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did you not believe him?</verse>
  <verse number="32">If we say, From men, we fear the people. For all men counted John that he was a prophet indeed.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And they answering, say to Jesus: We know not. And Jesus answering, saith to them: Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
