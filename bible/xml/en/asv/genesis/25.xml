  <verse number="1">And Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the sons of Midian: Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But unto the sons of the concubines, that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts; and he sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, a hundred threescore and fifteen years.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;</verse>
  <verse number="10">the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed Isaac his son: and Isaac dwelt by Beer-lahairoi.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bare unto Abraham:</verse>
  <verse number="13">and these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the first-born of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,</verse>
  <verse number="14">and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,</verse>
  <verse number="15">Hadad, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:</verse>
  <verse number="16">these are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their villages, and by their encampments; twelve princes according to their nations.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died, and was gathered unto his people.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: he abode over against all his brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham begat Isaac:</verse>
  <verse number="20">and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian, to be his wife.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren: and Jehovah was entreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, wherefore do I live? And she went to inquire of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Jehovah said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels: And the one people shall be stronger than the other people; And the elder shall serve the younger.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the first came forth red, all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And after that came forth his brother, and his hand had hold on Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And the boys grew: and Esau was a skilful hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a quiet man, dwelling in tents.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Now Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: and Rebekah loved Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Jacob boiled pottage: and Esau came in from the field, and he was faint:</verse>
  <verse number="30">and Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And Jacob said, Sell me first thy birthright.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And Esau said, Behold, I am about to die: and what profit shall the birthright do to me?</verse>
  <verse number="33">And Jacob said, Swear to me first; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: so Esau despised his birthright.</verse>
