<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash [their] hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And [when they come] from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, [as] the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with [their] lips, but their heart is far from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching [for] doctrines the commandments of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, [as] the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, [It is] Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; [he shall be free].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And when he had called all the people [unto him], he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one [of you], and understand:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, [it] cannot defile him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know [it]: but he could not be hid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For a [certain] woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast [it] unto the dogs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published [it];</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</p>
