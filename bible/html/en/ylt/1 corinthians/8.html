<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="8" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And concerning the things sacrificed to idols, we have known that we all have knowledge: knowledge puffeth up, but love buildeth up;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and if any one doth think to know anything, he hath not yet known anything according as it behoveth him to know;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and if any one doth love God, this one hath been known by Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Concerning the eating then of the things sacrificed to idols, we have known that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God except one;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">for even if there are those called gods, whether in heaven, whether upon earth—as there are gods many and lords many—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">yet to us is one God, the Father, of whom are the all things, and we to Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are the all things, and we through Him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">but not in all men is the knowledge, and certain with conscience of the idol, till now, as a thing sacrificed to an idol do eat it, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But victuals do not commend us to God, for neither if we may eat are we in advance; nor if we may not eat, are we behind;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">but see, lest this privilege of yours may become a stumbling-block to the infirm,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">for if any one may see thee that hast knowledge in an idol’s temple reclining at meat—shall not his conscience—he being infirm—be emboldened to eat the things sacrificed to idols,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and the brother who is infirm shall perish by thy knowledge, because of whom Christ died?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">and thus sinning in regard to the brethren, and smiting their weak conscience—in regard to Christ ye sin;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">wherefore, if victuals cause my brother to stumble, I may eat no flesh—to the age—that my brother I may not cause to stumble.</p>
