  <verse number="1">Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the soldiers having twined a crown of thorns, put upon his head, and they put round him a purple robe,</verse>
  <verse number="3">And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they gave him blows with a rod.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then again went out Pilate without, and says to them, See, I lead him to you without, that ye might know that in him I find no fault.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then went forth Jesus without, bearing a crown of thorns, and a purple garment. And he says to them, Behold the man!</verse>
  <verse number="6">When therefore the chief priests and attendants saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify, crucify. Pilate says to them, Take ye him, and crucify; for I find no fault in him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, for he made himself the Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="8">When Pilate heard this word, he was more afraid:</verse>
  <verse number="9">And went into the pretorium again, and says to Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then says Pilate to him, Speakest thou not to me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to loose thee.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Jesus answered, Thou hast no power against me, if it were not given thee from above: therefore he delivering me to thee has greater sin.</verse>
  <verse number="12">From this Pilate sought to loose him: and the Jews cried out, saying, If thou loose this, thou art not Caesar’s friend: every one making himself a king speaks against Caesar.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then Pilate having heard, brought Jesus without, and sat upon the judgment seat, in a place called Paved with ornamental stones; in Hebraic, Gabbatha.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And it was the preparation of the pascha, and about the sixth hour: and he says to the Jews, Behold your King!</verse>
  <verse number="15">And they cried, Take away, take away, crucify him. Pilate says to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then, therefore, delivered he him to them, that he might be crucified.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And they took Jesus, and led away: and bearing his cross he went out into a place called Kranium, which in Hebraic is called Golgotha:</verse>
  <verse number="18">Where they crucified him, and with him two others, hence and thence, and Jesus in the midst.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Pilate also wrote a title, and put upon the cross. And it was written, JESUS THE NAZARITE, KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Then read many of the Jews this title: for the place was near the city where Jesus was crucified: and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, Roman.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Then the soldiers, when they crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part: and also the coat: and the coat was unsewn through the whole, having been woven from above.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then said they to one another, Let us not divide it, but let us draw lots for it, whose it shall be: that the writing might be completed, saying, They divided my garments to themselves, and upon my clothing cast they the lot. Then truly did the soldiers these things.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And by the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Jesus then having seen the mother, and the disciple standing near, whom he loved, says to his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</verse>
  <verse number="27">Then says he to the disciple, Behold thy mother And from that hour the disciple took her to his own.</verse>
  <verse number="28">After this, Jesus knowing that all things were already completed, that the writing might be finished, says, I thirst.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Then was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they having filled a sponge with vinegar, put upon hyssop, and brought near to his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="30">When Jesus therefore took the vinegar, he said, It has been finished: and having bent the head, he delivered up the spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Then the Jews, that the bodies remain not upon the cross in the sabbath, since it was the preparation, (for great was the day of that sabbath,) asked Pilate that their legs be broken, and they be taken away.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Then came the soldiers, and truly brake the legs of the first, and of the other crucified with him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And upon having come to Jesus, when they saw him already dead, they brake not his legs:</verse>
  <verse number="34">But one of the soldiers with a javelin pricked his side, and quickly came out blood and water.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And he having seen has testified, and his testimony is true: and he knows that he says true, that ye might believe.</verse>
  <verse number="36">For these were that the writing be completed, A bone of him shall not be broken.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And again another writing says, They shall look on whom they goaded.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And after these, Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, in secret, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might takeaway the body of Jesus: and Pilate conceded. He came then, and took the body of Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And Nicodemus also came, he having come to Jesus at first by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about one hundred pounds.</verse>
  <verse number="40">Then took they the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen bandages with spices, as the custom is to the Jews to prepare a body for interment.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And in the place where he was crucified, was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one was ever laid.</verse>
  <verse number="42">There, therefore, on account of the Jews’ preparation, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus.</verse>
