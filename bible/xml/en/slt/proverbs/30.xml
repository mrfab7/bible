<chapter book="Proverbs" number="30" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The words of Agur, son of Jakeh: the lifting up: the declaration of the man to Ithiel; to Ithiel and Ucal:</verse>
  <verse number="2">For I am brutish more than man, and not the understanding of a man to me.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I learnt not wisdom, and I shall not know the knowledge of the holy.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who went up to the heavens, and came down? who gathered the wind in his fists? who bound the waters in a garment? who set up all the ends of the earth? what his name and what his son’s name, if thou shalt know?</verse>
  <verse number="5">All the word of God is purified: he a shield to those trusting in him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Thou shalt not add to his words lest he reprove in thee, and thou wert false.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Two things I asked from thee, thou wilt not withhold from me before I shall die:</verse>
  <verse number="8">Vanity and the word of falsehood remove far from me; thou wilt not give to me poverty and riches; feed me with bread of my allowance:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Lest I shall be filled and I spake lies, and said, Who is Jehovah? and lest I shall be dispossessed and I stole, and I laid hold upon the name of God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Thou shalt not slander the servant to his lord lest he shall curse thee, and thou wert guilty.</verse>
  <verse number="11">A generation will curse its father, and will not bless its mother.</verse>
  <verse number="12">A generation pure in its eyes, and not washed from its finding.</verse>
  <verse number="13">A generation, how its eyes were raised up and its eyelashes will be lifted up.</verse>
  <verse number="14">A generation, its teeth swords, and its biter’s teeth, knives, to devour the poor from the land, and the needy from man.</verse>
  <verse number="15">To the leech two daughters: Give, give. Behold, three shall not satisfied; four shall not say, Wealth:</verse>
  <verse number="16">Hades; and the closed womb; the earth not filled with water; and fire said not, Wealth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The eye shall mock to his father, and despise to obey the mother, the ravens of the valley shall bore it out and the sons of the eagle shall eat it.</verse>
  <verse number="18">They three were wonderful above me; and four, I knew them not:</verse>
  <verse number="19">The way of the eagle in the heavens; the way of the serpent upon the rock; the way of the ship in the heart of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.</verse>
  <verse number="20">So the way of a woman committing adultery; eating and wiping her mouth, and saying, I transgressed not.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For three the earth was moved, and for four, which it shall not be able to lift up:</verse>
  <verse number="22">For a servant when he shall reign; and the foolish one when he shall be filled with bread;</verse>
  <verse number="23">For a hated woman when she shall be married and a maid when she shall inherit to her mistress.</verse>
  <verse number="24">They four the small of the earth, and they are wise, being made wise:</verse>
  <verse number="25">The ants a people not strong, and they will prepare their bread in the summer;</verse>
  <verse number="26">The rabbits a people not strong, and they will set their house in the rock;</verse>
  <verse number="27">To the locust no king, and it will go forth divided all of them;</verse>
  <verse number="28">The lizard will take hold with their hands, and it is in the temples of the king.</verse>
  <verse number="29">They three making good the step, and four, making good to go:</verse>
  <verse number="30">The lion strong among cattle, and he will not turn back from the face of all;</verse>
  <verse number="31">One girded in loins, or a he goat; and a king, no rising up with him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">If thou wert foolish in lifting up thyself, and if thou purposed, the hand to the mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="33">For the pressure of milk will bring forth cheese, and the pressure of the nose will bring forth blood: and the pressure of wrath will, bring forth contention.</verse>
