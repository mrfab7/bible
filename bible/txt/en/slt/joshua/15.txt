1	And the lot shall be to the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families, to the bound of Edom, the desert of Zin south from the south extremity.
2	And the south bound shall be to them from the extremity of the salt sea from the tongue turning south.

12	And the bound of the sea, the great sea: and this bound the bound of the sons of Judah round about according to their families.
13	And to Caleb son of Jephunneh he gave a portion in the midst of the sons of Judah, according to the mouth of Jehovah to Joshua, the city of Arba the father of Anak, this is Hebron.
14	And Caleb drove from thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman and Talmai, children of Anak.
15	And he will go up from thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before, the City of the Book.
16	And Caleb will say, Who will smite the City of the Book and take it, and I gave to him Achsah my daughter for a wife.
17	And Othniel, son of Kenaz will take it, the brother of Caleb, and he will give to him Achsah his daughter for a wife.
18	And it will be in her going forth she will stimulate him to ask from her father a field: and she will descend from the ass, and Caleb will say to her, What to thee?
19	And she will say, Thou wilt give to me a blessing; for a south land thou gavest me, and give to me springs of water: and he will give to her the springs above and the springs beneath.
