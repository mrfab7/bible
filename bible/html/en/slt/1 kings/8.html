<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And every man of Israel will be convoked to king Solomon in the month Ethanim in the festival: this the seventh month.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And all the old men of Israel will come, and the priests will lift up the ark.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they will bring up the ark of Jehovah, and the tent of appointment, and all the holy vessels which were in the tent, and the priests and the Levites will bring them up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And king Solomon and all the assembly of Israel assembled together to him, with him before the ark sacrificing sheep and oxen which shall not be counted and shall not be numbered for multitude.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the priests will bring up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah to its place to the oracle of the house to the holy of holies, to beneath the wings of the cherubims.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For the cherubims spreading out their wings to the place of the ark, and the cherubims will cover over the ark and over the parts from above.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And they will prolong the bars and the heads of the bars will be seen from the holies upon the face of the oracle, and they will not be seen without; and they will be there till this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Nothing in the ark only the two tables of stones that Moses set down there in Horeb which Jehovah cut out with the sons of Israel in their coming out of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And thy king will turn his face round and bless all the convocation of Israel; and all the convocation of Israel stood;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he will say, Blessed Jehovah the God of Israel, who spake by his mouth to David my father, and by his hand filled up, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">From the day which I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt I chose not a city from all the tribes of Israel to build a house for my name to be there; and I will choose upon David to be over my people Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And it will be with the heart of David my father to build a house for name of Jehovah the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Jehovah will say to David my father, Because it was with thy heart to build a house for my name, it was good it was with thy heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But thou shalt not build a house, but thy son coming forth from thy loins, he shall build the house for my name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Jehovah will raise up his word which he spake; and I shall rise instead of David my father, and sit upon the throne of Israel, as Jehovah spake; and I will build the house for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And I will set there a place for the ark, where is there the covenant of Jehovah which he cut out with our fathers in his bringing them out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Solomon will stand at the face of the altar of Jehovah before all the convocation of Israel, and he will spread forth his hands to the heavens:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he will say, Jehovah the God of Israel, none like thee, the God in the heavens from above and upon the earth from beneath, watching the covenant and the mercy to thy servants going before thee with all their heart:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Which thou didst watch to thy servant David my father what thou spakest to him: and thou wilt speak with thy mouth, and with thy hand thou didst complete as this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And now Jehovah God of Israel watch to thy servant David my father what thou spakest to him, saying, There shall not be cut off to thee a man from my face sitting upon the throne of Israel; only if thy sons shall watch their way to go before me as thou didst go before me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And now, O God of Israel, thy word now shall be firm which thou spakest to thy servant David my father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For truly shall God dwell upon the earth? Behold the heavens and the heavens of the heavens shall not contain thee; much less this house which I built.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And look to the supplication of thy servant, and to his prayer, O Jehovah my God, to hear to the cry and to the supplication which thy servant prays before thee this day:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For thine eye to be opened to this house night and day, to the place of which thou saidst, My name shall be there; to hear to the supplication which thy servant shall pray to this place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And wilt thou hear to the prayer of thy servant and of thy people Israel which they shall pray to this place? and wilt thou hear to the place of thy dwelling to the heavens? and hear and forgive?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Whatever man shall sin against his neighbor, and an oath lifted up upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altar in this house,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And thou wilt hear in the heavens, and do, and judge thy servants to condemn the unjust, to give his way upon his head, and to acquit the just, to give to him according to his justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">In thy people Israel being struck before the enemy because they will sin against thee, and they turned back to thee, and they confessed thy name and prayed, and made supplication to thee in this house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And wilt thou hear in the heavens and forgive to the sin of thy people Israel, and turn them back to the land which thou gavest to their fathers?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">In the heavens being shut up and there will be no rain when they shall sin against thee; and they pray to this place and profess thy name, and they turn back from their sin when thou shalt humble them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And wilt thou hear in the heavens and forgive to the sin of thy servants and of thy people Israel? for thou wilt teach them the good way which they shall go in it, and give rain upon thy land which thou gavest to thy people for an inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">If famine shall be in the land, if there shall be death, blasting, yellowness, the locust devouring; if his enemy shall press upon him in the land of his gates, every blow, every sickness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">Every prayer, every supplication which shall be to every man to all thy people Israel which shall know a man the blow to his heart and spread forth his hands to this house:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Wilt thou hear in the heavens thy prepared dwelling, and forgive and do, and give to a man according to all his ways? for thou wilt know his heart; for thou wilt know alone the heart of all the sons of men:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">So that they will fear thee all the days which they live upon the face of the earth which thou gavest to our fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And also for the strangers which are not of thy people Israel, he shall come from a land afar off for sake of thy name;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">(For they will hear of thy great name and thy strong hand, and thy stretched out arm;) and coming and praying to this house;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">Wilt thou hear in the heavens thy prepared dwelling, and do according to all the stranger shall call upon thee? so that all the people of the earth shall know thy name to fear thee as thy people Israel; and to know that thy name was called upon this house which I built.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">If thy people shall go forth to war against his enemy in the way which thou shalt send them, and pray to Jehovah the way of the city which thou didst choose in it, and the house which I built for thy name:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">And hear thou in the heavens their supplication and their prayer, and do their judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">For they will sin against thee (for no man which will not sin) and thou wert angry with them and gave them before the enemy, and they carried them away their captives to the land of the enemy, far off or near;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">And they turned back to their heart in the land which they were carried captive there, and they turned back and supplicated to thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We sinned and acted perversely, and did evil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">And they turned back to thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies who carried them captive, and prayed to thee the way of their land which thou gavest to their fathers, the city which thou didst choose, and the house which I built to thy name:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">And hear in the heavens thy prepared dwelling, their supplication and their prayer, and do their judgment,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">And forgive to thy people who sinned against thee, and all their transgressions which they transgressed against thee, and give them for compassion before those carrying them captive, and they compassionated them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">For they thy people and thine inheritance which thou broughtest forth out of Egypt from the midst of the furnace of iron:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">For thine eyes to be opened to the prayer of thy servant and to the prayer of thy people Israel, to hear to them in all their calling to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">For thou didst separate them to thyself for an inheritance from all the people of the earth as thou spakest by the hand of Moses thy servant, in thy bringing our fathers out of the land of Egypt, O Lord Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">And it will be as Solomon finished praying to Jehovah all this supplication and prayer, he rose from the face of the altar of Jehovah, from bending upon his knees and his hands spread forth to the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">And he will stand and bless all the convocation of Israel with a great voice, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">Blessed Jehovah who gave rest to his people Israel, according to all which he spake: there fell not one word from all his good word which he spake by the hand of Moses his servant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="57">Jehovah our God will be with us as he was with our fathers: he will not forsake us, and he will not cast us off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="58">To incline our heart to him, to go in all his ways, and to watch his commands and his laws and his judgments which he commanded our fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="59">And these words which I supplicated before Jehovah shall be drawing near to Jehovah our God day and night, to do the judgment of his servant and the judgment of his people Israel, the word of a day in its day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="60">For all the people of the earth to know that Jehovah he is God, none besides.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="61">And your hearts be perfect with Jehovah our God to go in his laws, and to watch his commands as this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="62">And the king and all Israel with him sacrificed a sacrifice before Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="63">And Solomon will sacrifice a sacrifice of peace which he sacrificed to Jehovah, twenty and two thousand oxen, and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep. And the king and all the sons of Israel will consecrate the house of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="64">In that day the king consecrated the middle of the enclosure which was before the house of Jehovah: for he did there the burnt-offering and the gifts and the fat of the peace: for the altar of brass which was before Jehovah was little for containing the burnt-offering and the gifts and the fat of the peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="65">And Solomon will make the festival in that day, and all Israel with him, a great convocation from the going in of Hamath even to the torrent of Egypt, before Jehovah our God seven days and seven days, fourteen days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="66">In the eighth day he sent away the people, and they will bless the king and go to their tents rejoicing and good of heart for all the good which Jehovah did for David his servant and for Israel his people.</p>
