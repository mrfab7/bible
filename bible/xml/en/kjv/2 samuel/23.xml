  <verse number="1">Now these [be] the last words of David. David the son of Jesse said, and the man [who was] raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word [was] in my tongue.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spake to me, He that ruleth over men [must be] just, ruling in the fear of God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And [he shall be] as the light of the morning, [when] the sun riseth, [even] a morning without clouds; [as] the tender grass [springing] out of the earth by clear shining after rain.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Although my house [be] not so with God; yet he hath made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all [things], and sure: for [this is] all my salvation, and all [my] desire, although he make [it] not to grow.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But [the sons] of Belial [shall be] all of them as thorns thrust away, because they cannot be taken with hands:</verse>
  <verse number="7">But the man [that] shall touch them must be fenced with iron and the staff of a spear; and they shall be utterly burned with fire in the [same] place.</verse>
  <verse number="8">These [be] the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same [was] Adino the Eznite: [he lift up his spear] against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And after him [was] Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, [one] of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines [that] were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:</verse>
  <verse number="10">He arose, and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword: and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the people returned after him only to spoil.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And after him [was] Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentiles: and the people fled from the Philistines.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But he stood in the midst of the ground, and defended it, and slew the Philistines: and the LORD wrought a great victory.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And three of the thirty chief went down, and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam: and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of Rephaim.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And David [was] then in an hold, and the garrison of the Philistines [was] then [in] Bethlehem.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which [is] by the gate!</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the three mighty men brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that [was] by the gate, and took [it], and brought [it] to David: nevertheless he would not drink thereof, but poured it out unto the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he said, Be it far from me, O LORD, that I should do this: [is not this] the blood of the men that went in jeopardy of their lives? therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mighty men.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, [and] slew [them], and had the name among three.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Was he not most honourable of three? therefore he was their captain: howbeit he attained not unto the [first] three.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lionlike men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow:</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he slew an Egyptian, a goodly man: and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and slew him with his own spear.</verse>
  <verse number="22">These [things] did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among three mighty men.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He was more honourable than the thirty, but he attained not to the [first] three. And David set him over his guard.</verse>
