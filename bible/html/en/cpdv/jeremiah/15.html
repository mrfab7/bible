<div class="chapter" data-book="Jeremiah" data-chapter="15" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the Lord said to me: “Even if Moses and Samuel were to stand before me, my soul would not be toward this people. Cast them away from my face, and let them depart!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And if they say to you, ‘Where shall we go?’ you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord: Those who go to death, shall go to death. And those who go to the sword, shall go to the sword, and those go to famine, shall go to famine, and those who go to captivity, shall go to captivity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I will visit against them in four ways, says the Lord: by the sword, to kill; and by dogs, to tear apart; and by the birds of the air and by the beasts of the earth, to devour and to scatter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I will give them over to the fervor of all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, because of all that he did in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For who will take pity on you, O Jerusalem? Or who will feel sorrow for you? Or who will go to prayer for the sake of your peace?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">You have abandoned me, says the Lord. You have gone backwards. And so, I will extend my hand over you, and I will destroy you. I have labored to plead with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I will scatter them with a winnowing fan at the gates of the land. I have killed and dispersed my people, and yet they have not turned back from their ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Their widows have been multiplied by me, more so than the sand of the sea. I have led them against the mother of a youth like an attacker at midday. I have sent a terror suddenly against the cities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">She who gave birth to seven has become weak. Her life has faded away. Her sun has set while it was still daytime. She has been confounded and shamed. And the remainder of them I will give over to the sword in the sight of their enemies, says the Lord.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">“O my mother, woe to me! Why did you conceive me, a man of strife, a man of discord to all the earth? I have not lent money at interest, nor has anyone lent money at interest to me. Yet everyone is cursing me.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The Lord says: “Certainly, it will be well with your remnant. Certainly, I will run to meet you, in the time of affliction and in the time of tribulation, against the enemy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But how can iron be joined with the iron from the north or with brass?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Your riches and your treasures I will give over to be freely despoiled, because of all your sins, even throughout all your borders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And I will lead in your enemies from a land that you do not know. For a fire has been kindled in my fury; it will burn upon you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">“You know me, O Lord. Remember me, and visit me, and watch over me, because of those who persecute me. In your patience, do not choose to let me endure. You know I have suffered reproach because of you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I discovered your words and I consumed them. And your word became to me as the gladness and joy of my heart. For your name has been invoked over me, O Lord, the God of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I did not sit in the company of mockers, nor did I glorify myself before the presence of your hand. I sat alone, because you filled me with threats.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Why has my sorrow become never-ending, and why has my wound become so dire that it refuses to be cured? It has become for me like the deception of untrustworthy waters.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Because of this, thus says the Lord: “If you will be converted, I will convert you. And you will stand before my face. And you will separate what is precious from what is vile. You will be my mouthpiece. They will be converted to you, but you will not be converted to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And I will present you to this people as a strong wall of brass. And they will fight against you, and they will not prevail. For I am with you, so as to save you and to rescue you, says the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And I will free you from hand of those who are most wicked, and I will redeem you from the hand of the powerful.”</p>
