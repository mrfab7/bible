  <verse number="1">A Prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Jehovah, I heard the report of thee, [and] I feared. Jehovah, revive thy work in the midst of the years, In the midst of the years make [it] known: In wrath remember mercy!</verse>
  <verse number="3">God came from Teman, And the holy one from mount Paran. Selah. his glory covereth the heavens, And the earth is full of his praise.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And [his] brightness was as the light; Rays [came forth] from his hand; And there was the hiding of his power.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Before him went the pestilence, And a burning flame went forth at his feet.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He stood, and measured the earth; He beheld, and discomfited the nations; And the eternal mountains were scattered, The everlasting hills gave way: His ways are everlasting.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; The curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Was Jehovah wrathful with the rivers? Was thine anger against the rivers? Was thy rage against the sea, That thou didst ride upon thy horses, Thy chariots of salvation?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Thy bow was made naked, The rods [of discipline] sworn according to [thy] word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The mountains saw thee, they were in travail: Torrents of waters passed by; The deep uttered its voice, Lifted up its hands on high.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The sun [and] moon stood still in their habitation, At the light of thine arrows which shot forth,—At the shining of thy glittering spear.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Thou didst march through the land in indignation, Thou didst thresh the nations in anger.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, For the salvation of thine anointed; Thou didst smite off the head from the house of the wicked, Laying bare the foundation even to the neck. Selah.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thou didst strike through with his own spears the head of his leaders: They came out as a whirlwind to scatter me, Whose exulting was as to devour the afflicted secretly.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thou didst walk through the sea with thy horses, The heap of great waters.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I heard, and my belly trembled; My lips quivered at the voice; Rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in my place, That I might rest in the day of distress, When their invader shall come up against the people.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For though the fig-tree shall not blossom, Neither shall fruit be in the vines; The labour of the olive-tree shall fail, And the fields shall yield no food; The flock shall be cut off from the fold, And there shall be no herd in the stalls:</verse>
  <verse number="18">Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength, And he maketh my feet like hinds’ [feet], And he will make me to walk upon my high places. To the chief Musician. On my stringed instruments.</verse>
