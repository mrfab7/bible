  <verse number="1">AND he spoke also a parable to them, that we ought always to pray, and not to faint,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Saying: There was a judge in a certain city, who feared not God, nor regarded man.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And there was a certain widow in that city, and she came to him, saying: Avenge me of my adversary.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he would not for a long time. But afterwards he said within himself: Although I fear not God, nor regard man,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Yet because this widow is troublesome to me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary me.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge saith.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night: and will he have patience in their regard?</verse>
  <verse number="8">I say to you, that he will quickly revenge them. But yet the Son of man, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth?</verse>
  <verse number="9">And to some who trusted in themselves as just, and despised others, he spoke also this parable:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: O God, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, as also is this publican.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I fast twice in a week: I give tithes of all that I possess.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the publican, standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his eyes towards heaven; but struck his breast, saying: O god, be merciful to me a sinner.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I say to you, this man went down into his house justified rather that the other: because every one that exalteth himself, shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself, shall be exalted.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them. Which when the disciples saw, they rebuked them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But Jesus, calling them together, said: Suffer children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Amen, I say to you: Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a child, shall not enter into it.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And a certain ruler asked him, saying: Good master, what shall I do to possess everlasting life?</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Jesus said to him: Why dost thou call me good? None is good but God alone.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Thou knowest the commandments: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not steal: Thou shalt not bear false witness: Honour thy father and mother.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Who said: All these things have I kept from my youth.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Which when Jesus had heard, he said to him: Yet one thing is wanting to thee: sell all whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He having heard these things, became sorrowful; for he was very rich.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Jesus seeing him become sorrowful, said: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And they that heard it, said: Who then can be saved?</verse>
  <verse number="27">He said to them: The things that are impossible with men, are possible with God.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then Peter said: Behold, we have left all things, and have followed thee.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Who said to them: Amen, I say to you, there is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God’s sake,</verse>
  <verse number="30">Who shall not receive much more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Then Jesus took unto him the twelve, and said to them: Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be accomplished which were written by the prophets concerning the Son of man.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and scourged, and spit upon:</verse>
  <verse number="33">And after they have scourged him, they will put him to death; and the third day he shall rise again.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid from them, and they understood not the things that were said.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Now it came to pass, when he drew nigh to Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the way side, begging.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And he cried out, saying: Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And they that went before, rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out much more: Son of David, have mercy on me.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And Jesus standing, commanded him to be brought unto him. And when he was come near, he asked him,</verse>
  <verse number="41">Saying: What wilt thou that I do to thee? But he said: Lord, that I may see.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And Jesus said to him: Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And immediately he saw, and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.</verse>
