<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A wise son—the instruction of a father, And a scorner—he hath not heard rebuke.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">From the fruit of the mouth a man eateth good, And the soul of the treacherous—violence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Whoso is keeping his mouth, is keeping his soul, Whoso is opening wide his lips—ruin to him!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The soul of the slothful is desiring, and hath not. And the soul of the diligent is made fat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A false word the righteous hateth, And the wicked causeth abhorrence, and is confounded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Righteousness keepeth him who is perfect in the way, And wickedness overthroweth a sin offering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">There is who is making himself rich, and hath nothing, Who is making himself poor, and wealth is abundant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The ransom of a man’s life are his riches, And the poor hath not heard rebuke.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The light of the righteous rejoiceth, And the lamp of the wicked is extinguished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A vain man through pride causeth debate, And with the counselled is wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Wealth from vanity becometh little, And whoso is gathering by the hand becometh great.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Hope prolonged is making the heart sick, And a tree of life is the coming desire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whoso is despising the Word is destroyed for it, And whoso is fearing the Command is repayed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The law of the wise is a fountain of life, To turn aside from snares of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Good understanding giveth grace, And the way of the treacherous is hard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Every prudent one dealeth with knowledge, And a fool spreadeth out folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A wicked messenger falleth into evil, And a faithful ambassador is healing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Whoso is refusing instruction—poverty and shame, And whoso is observing reproof is honoured.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A desire accomplished is sweet to the soul, And an abomination to fools is: Turn from evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Whoso is walking with wise men is wise, And a companion of fools suffereth evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Evil pursueth sinners, And good recompenseth the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A good man causeth sons’ sons to inherit, And laid up for the righteous is the sinner’s wealth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Abundance of food—the tillage of the poor, And substance is consumed without judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Whoso is sparing his rod is hating his son, And whoso is loving him hath hastened him chastisement.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The righteous is eating to the satiety of his soul, And the belly of the wicked lacketh!</p>
