<p class="verse" data-verse="1">God having spoken in many parts and in many ways formerly to the fathers in the prophets,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">at the end of these days has spoken to us in [the person of the] Son, whom he has established heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">who being [the] effulgence of his glory and [the] expression of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, having made [by himself] the purification of sins, set himself down on the right hand of the greatness on high,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">taking a place by so much better than the angels, as he inherits a name more excellent than they.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For to which of the angels said he ever, Thou art my Son: this day have I begotten thee? and again, I will be to him for father, and he shall be to me for son?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and again, when he brings in the firstborn into the habitable world, he says, And let all God’s angels worship him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And as to the angels he says, Who makes his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">but as to the Son, Thy throne, O God, [is] to the age of the age, and a sceptre of uprightness [is] the sceptre of thy kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Thou hast loved righteousness and hast hated lawlessness; therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with oil of gladness above thy companions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And, Thou in the beginning, Lord, hast founded the earth, and works of thy hands are the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They shall perish, but thou continuest still; and they all shall grow old as a garment,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">and as a covering shalt thou roll them up, and they shall be changed; but thou art the Same, and thy years shall not fail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But as to which of the angels said he ever, Sit at my right hand until I put thine enemies [as] footstool of thy feet?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out for service on account of those who shall inherit salvation?</p>
