<chapter book="Acts" number="8" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And Saul was there, giving approval to Stephen’s death. On that day a great persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.</verse>
  <verse number="2">God-fearing men buried Stephen and mourned deeply over him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ to them.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The crowds all paid close attention to Philip’s message and to the signs they saw him perform.</verse>
  <verse number="7">With loud shrieks, unclean spirits came out of many who were possessed, and many of the paralyzed and lame were healed.</verse>
  <verse number="8">So there was great joy in that city.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Prior to that time, a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and astounded the people of Samaria. He claimed to be someone great,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and all the people, from the least to the greatest, heeded his words and said, “This man is the divine power called the Great Power.”</verse>
  <verse number="11">They paid close attention to him because he had astounded them for a long time with his sorcery.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But when they believed Philip as he preached the gospel of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Even Simon himself believed and was baptized. He followed Philip closely and was astounded by the great signs and miracles he observed.</verse>
  <verse number="14">When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.</verse>
  <verse number="15">On their arrival, they prayed for them to receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen upon any of them; they had simply been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="18">When Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money.</verse>
  <verse number="19">“Give me this power as well,” he said, “so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit.”</verse>
  <verse number="20">But Peter replied, “May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money!</verse>
  <verse number="21">You have no part or share in our ministry, because your heart is not right before God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Repent, therefore, of your wickedness, and pray to the Lord. Perhaps He will forgive you for the intent of your heart.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For I see that you are poisoned by bitterness and captive to iniquity.”</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then Simon answered, “Pray to the Lord for me, so that nothing you have said may happen to me.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">And after Peter and John had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many of the Samaritan villages.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Get up and go south to the desert road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.”</verse>
  <verse number="27">So he started out, and on his way he met an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official in charge of the entire treasury of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. He had gone to Jerusalem to worship,</verse>
  <verse number="28">and on his return was sitting in his chariot reading Isaiah the prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="29">The Spirit said to Philip, “Go over to that chariot and stay by it.”</verse>
  <verse number="30">So Philip ran up and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. “Do you understand what you are reading?” Philip asked.</verse>
  <verse number="31">“How can I,” he said, “unless someone guides me?” And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">The eunuch was reading this passage of Scripture: “He was led like a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is silent, so He did not open His mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="33">In His humiliation He was deprived of justice. Who can recount His descendants? For His life was removed from the earth.”</verse>
  <verse number="34">“Tell me,” said the eunuch, “who is the prophet talking about, himself or someone else?”</verse>
  <verse number="35">Then Philip began with this very Scripture and told him the good news about Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="36">As they traveled along the road and came to some water, the eunuch said, “Look, here is water! What is there to prevent me from being baptized?”</verse>
  <verse number="37"></verse>
  <verse number="38">And he gave orders to stop the chariot. Then both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.</verse>
  <verse number="39">When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, but went on his way rejoicing.</verse>
  <verse number="40">But Philip appeared at Azotus and traveled through that region, preaching the gospel in all the towns until he came to Caesarea.</verse>
