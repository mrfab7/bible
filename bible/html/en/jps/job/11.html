<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk be accounted right?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thy boastings have made men hold their peace, And thou hast mocked, with none to make thee ashamed;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And thou hast said: ‘My doctrine is pure, And I am clean in Thine eyes.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But oh that God would speak, And open His lips against thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And that He would tell thee the secrets of wisdom, That sound wisdom is manifold! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Canst thou find out the deep things of God? Canst thou attain unto the purpose of the Almighty?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">It is high as heaven; what canst thou do? Deeper than the nether-world; what canst thou know?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The measure thereof is longer than the earth, And broader than the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If He pass by, and shut up, Or gather in, then who can hinder Him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For He knoweth base men; And when He seeth iniquity, will He not then consider it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But an empty man will get understanding, When a wild ass’s colt is born a man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If thou set thy heart aright, And stretch out thy hands toward Him—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away, And let not unrighteousness dwell in thy tents—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; Yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For thou shalt forget thy misery; Thou shalt remember it as waters that are passed away;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And thy life shall be clearer than the noonday; Though there be darkness, it shall be as the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; Yea, thou shalt look about thee, and shalt take thy rest in safety.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; Yea, many shall make suit unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, And they shall have no way to flee, And their hope shall be the drooping of the soul.</p>
