  <verse number="1">“Do not judge, so that you may not be judged.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For with whatever judgment you judge, so shall you be judged; and with whatever measure you measure out, so shall it be measured back to you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And how can you see the splinter in your brother’s eye, and not see the board in your own eye?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the splinter from your eye,’ while, behold, a board is in your own eye?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Hypocrite, first remove the board from your own eye, and then you will see clearly enough to remove the splinter from your brother’s eye.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not cast your pearls before swine, lest perhaps they may trample them under their feet, and then, turning, they may tear you apart.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Ask, and it shall be given to you. Seek, and you shall find. Knock, and it shall be opened to you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For everyone who asks, receives; and whoever seeks, finds; and to anyone who knocks, it will be opened.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Or what man is there among you, who, if his son were to ask him for bread, would offer him a stone;</verse>
  <verse number="10">or if he were to ask him for a fish, would offer him a snake?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Therefore, if you, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your sons, how much more will your Father, who is in heaven, give good things to those who ask him?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Therefore, all things whatsoever that you wish that men would do to you, do so also to them. For this is the law and the prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate, and broad is the way, which leads to perdition, and many there are who enter through it.</verse>
  <verse number="14">How narrow is the gate, and how straight is the way, which leads to life, and few there are who find it!</verse>
  <verse number="15">Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves.</verse>
  <verse number="16">You shall know them by their fruits. Can grapes be gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles?</verse>
  <verse number="17">So then, every good tree produces good fruit, and the evil tree produces evil fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="18">A good tree is not able to produce evil fruit, and an evil tree is not able to produce good fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Every tree which does not produce good fruit shall be cut down and cast into the fire.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Therefore, by their fruits you will know them.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Not all who say to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does the will of my Father, who is in heaven, the same shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Many will say to me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and perform many powerful deeds in your name?’</verse>
  <verse number="23">And then will I disclose to them: ‘I have never known you. Depart from me, you workers of iniquity.’</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and does them shall be compared to a wise man, who built his house upon the rock.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the rains descended, and the floods rose up, and the winds blew, and rushed upon that house, but it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them shall be like a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And the rains descended, and the floods rose up, and the winds blew, and rushed upon that house, and it did fall, and great was its ruin.”</verse>
  <verse number="28">And it happened, when Jesus had completed these words, that the crowds were astonished at his doctrine.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For he was teaching them as one who has authority, and not like their scribes and Pharisees.</verse>
