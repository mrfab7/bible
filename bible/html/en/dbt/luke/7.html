<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And when he had completed all his words in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And a certain centurionâ€™s bondman who was dear to him was ill and about to die;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and having heard of Jesus, he sent to him elders of the Jews, begging him that he might come and save his bondman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But they, being come to Jesus, besought him diligently, saying, He is worthy to whom thou shouldest grant this,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">for he loves our nation, and himself has built the synagogue for us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Jesus went with them. But already, when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent to him friends, saying to him, Lord, do not trouble thyself, for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wherefore neither did I count myself worthy to come to thee. But say by a word and my servant shall be healed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For I also am a man placed under authority, having under myself soldiers, and I say to this [one], Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my bondman, Do this, and he does [it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Jesus hearing this wondered at him, and turning to the crowd following him said, I say to you, Not even in Israel have I found so great faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And they who had been sent returning to the house found the bondman, who was ill, in good health.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And it came to pass afterwards he went into a city called Nain, and many of his disciples and a great crowd went with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And as he drew near to the gate of the city, behold, a dead man was carried out, the only son of his mother, and she a widow, and a very considerable crowd of the city [was] with her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the Lord, seeing her, was moved with compassion for her, and said to her, Weep not;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and coming up he touched the bier, and the bearers stopped. And he said, Youth, I say to thee, Wake up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the dead sat up and began to speak; and he gave him to his mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And fear seized on all, and they glorified God, saying, A great prophet has been raised up amongst us; and God has visited his people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And this report went out in all Judaea concerning him, and in all the surrounding country.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the disciples of John brought him word concerning all these things:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and John, having called two of his disciples, sent to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that is coming, or are we to wait for another?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But the men having come to him said, John the baptist has sent us to thee, saying, Art thou he that is coming, or are we to wait for another?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">In that hour he healed many of diseases and plagues and evil spirits, and to many blind he granted sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Jesus answering said to them, Go, bring back word to John of what ye have seen and heard: that blind see, lame walk, lepers are cleansed, deaf hear, dead are raised, poor are evangelized;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">and blessed is whosoever shall not be offended in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And the messengers of John having departed, he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: What went ye out into the wilderness to behold? a reed shaken by the wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But what went ye out to see? a man clothed in delicate garments? Behold, those who are in splendid clothing and live luxuriously are in the courts of kings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But what went ye out to see? a prophet? Yea, I say to you, and [what is] more excellent than a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">This is he concerning whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">for I say unto you, Among them that are born of women a greater [prophet] is no one than John [the baptist]; but he who is a little one in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">(And all the people who heard [it], and the tax-gatherers, justified God, having been baptised with the baptism of John;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">but the Pharisees and the lawyers rendered null as to themselves the counsel of God, not having been baptised by him.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">To whom therefore shall I liken the men of this generation, and to whom are they like?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">They are like children sitting in the market-place, and calling one to another and saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">For John the baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and ye say, He has a demon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">The Son of man has come eating and drinking, and ye say, Behold an eater and wine-drinker, a friend of tax-gatherers and sinners;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">and wisdom has been justified of all her children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">But one of the Pharisees begged him that he would eat with him. And entering into the house of the Pharisee he took his place at table;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">and behold, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, and knew that he was sitting at meat in the house of the Pharisee, having taken an alabaster box of myrrh,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">and standing at his feet behind [him] weeping, began to wash his feet with tears; and she wiped them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed [them] with the myrrh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And the Pharisee who had invited him, seeing it, spoke with himself saying, This [person] if he were a prophet would have known who and what the woman is who touches him, for she is a sinner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And Jesus answering said to him, Simon, I have somewhat to say to thee. And he says, Teacher, say [it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">There were two debtors of a certain creditor: one owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">but as they had nothing to pay, he forgave both of them [their debt]: [say,] which of them therefore will love him most?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And Simon answering said, I suppose he to whom he forgave the most. And he said to him, Thou hast rightly judged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And turning to the woman he said to Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house; thou gavest me not water on my feet, but she has washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with her hair.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Thou gavest me not a kiss, but she from the time I came in has not ceased kissing my feet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">My head with oil thou didst not anoint, but she has anointed my feet with myrrh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">For which cause I say to thee, Her many sins are forgiven; for she loved much; but he to whom little is forgiven loves little.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">And he said to her, Thy sins are forgiven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">And they that were with [them] at table began to say within themselves, Who is this who forgives also sins?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">And he said to the woman, Thy faith has saved thee; go in peace.</p>
