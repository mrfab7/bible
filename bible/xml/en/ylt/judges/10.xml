  <verse number="1">And there riseth after Abimelech, to save Israel, Tola son of Puah, son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, and he is dwelling in Shamir, in the hill-country of Ephraim,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and he judgeth Israel twenty and three years, and he dieth, and is buried in Shamir.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And there riseth after him Jair the Gileadite, and he judgeth Israel twenty and two years,</verse>
  <verse number="4">and he hath thirty sons riding on thirty ass-colts, and they have thirty cities, (they call them Havoth-Jair unto this day), which are in the land of Gilead;</verse>
  <verse number="5">and Jair dieth, and is buried in Kamon.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the sons of Israel add to do the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, and serve the Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Aram, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the Bene-Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsake Jehovah, and have not served Him;</verse>
  <verse number="7">and the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel, and He selleth them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the Bene-Ammon,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and they crush and oppress the sons of Israel in that year—eighteen years all the sons of Israel who are beyond the Jordan, in the land of the Amorite, which is in Gilead.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the Bene-Ammon pass over the Jordan to fight also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, and Israel hath great distress.</verse>

  <verse number="12">And the Zidonians, and Amalek, and Maon have oppressed you, and ye cry unto Me, and I save you out of their hand;</verse>
  <verse number="13">and ye—ye have forsaken Me, and serve other gods, therefore I add not to save you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Go and cry unto the gods on which ye have fixed; they—they save you in the time of your adversity.’</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the sons of Israel say unto Jehovah, ‘We have sinned, do Thou to us according to all that is good in Thine eyes; only deliver us, we pray Thee, this day.’</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they turn aside the gods of the stranger out of their midst, and serve Jehovah, and His soul is grieved with the misery of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the Bene-Ammon are called together, and encamp in Gilead, and the sons of Israel are gathered together, and encamp in Mizpah.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the people—heads of Gilead—say one unto another, ‘Who is the man that doth begin to fight against the Bene-Ammon? he is for head to all inhabitants of Gilead.’</verse>
