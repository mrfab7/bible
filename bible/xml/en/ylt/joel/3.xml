  <verse number="1">For lo, in those days, and in that time, When I turn back to the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Then I have gathered all the nations, And caused them to go down unto the valley of Jehoshaphat, And I have been judged with them there, Concerning My people and Mine inheritance—Israel, Whom they scattered among nations, And My land they have apportioned.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And for My people they do cast a lot, And they give the young man for an harlot, And the young woman have sold for wine, That they may drink.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And also, what are ye to Me, O Tyre and Zidon, And all circuits of Philistia? Recompence are ye rendering unto Me? And if ye are giving recompence to Me, Swiftly, hastily, I turn back your recompence on your head.</verse>
  <verse number="5">In that My silver and My gold ye took, And My desirable things that are good, Ye have brought in to your temples.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And sons of Judah, and sons of Jerusalem, Ye have sold to the sons of Javan, To put them far off from their border.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Lo, I am stirring them up out of the place Whither ye have sold them, And I have turned back your recompence on your head,</verse>
  <verse number="8">And have sold your sons and your daughters Into the hand of the sons of Judah, And they have sold them to Shabeans, Unto a nation far off, for Jehovah hath spoken.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Proclaim ye this among nations, Sanctify a war, stir up the mighty ones, Come nigh, come up, let all the men of war.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Beat your ploughshares to swords, And your pruning-hooks to javelins, Let the weak say, ‘I am mighty.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">Haste, and come in, all ye nations round, And be gathered together, Thither cause to come down, O Jehovah, Thy mighty ones.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Wake and come up let the nations unto the valley of Jehoshaphat, For there I sit to judge all the nations around.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Send ye forth a sickle, For ripened hath harvest, Come in, come down, for filled hath been the press, Overflowed hath wine-presses, For great is their wickedness.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Multitudes, multitudes are in the valley of decision, For near is the day of Jehovah in the valley of decision.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Sun and moon have been black, And stars have gathered up their shining.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Jehovah from Zion doth roar, And from Jerusalem giveth forth His voice, And shaken have the heavens and earth, And Jehovah is a refuge to his people, And a stronghold to sons of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And ye have known that I am Jehovah your God, Dwelling in Zion, My holy mountain, And Jerusalem hath been holy, And strangers do not pass over into it again.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And it hath come to pass, in that day, Drop down do the mountains juice, And the hills do flow with milk, And all streams of Judah do go with water, And a fountain from the house of Jehovah goeth forth, And hath watered the valley of Shittim.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Egypt a desolation becometh, And Edom a desolation, a wilderness, becometh, For violence to sons of Judah, Whose innocent blood they shed in their land.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Judah to the age doth dwell, And Jerusalem to generation and generation.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And I have declared their blood innocent, That I did not declare innocent, And Jehovah is dwelling in Zion!</verse>
