  <verse number="1">Then Job answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">I have heard many such things: Miserable comforters are ye all.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Shall vain words have an end? Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?</verse>
  <verse number="4">I also could speak as ye do; If your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could join words together against you, And shake my head at you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But I would strengthen you with my mouth, And the solace of my lips would assuage your grief.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged; And though I forbear, what am I eased?</verse>
  <verse number="7">But now he hath made me weary: Thou hast made desolate all my company.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And thou hast laid fast hold on me, which is a witness against me: And my leanness riseth up against me, It testifieth to my face.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He hath torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me; He hath gnashed upon me with his teeth: Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They have gaped upon me with their mouth; They have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully: They gather themselves together against me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">God delivereth me to the ungodly, And casteth me into the hands of the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I was at ease, and he brake me asunder; Yea, he hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces: He hath also set me up for his mark.</verse>
  <verse number="13">His archers compass me round about; He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; He poureth out my gall upon the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He breaketh me with breach upon breach; He runneth upon me like a giant.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, And have laid my horn in the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="16">My face is red with weeping, And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;</verse>
  <verse number="17">Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure.</verse>
  <verse number="18">O earth, cover not thou my blood, And let my cry have no resting-place.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, And he that voucheth for me is on high.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My friends scoff at me: But mine eye poureth out tears unto God,</verse>
  <verse number="21">That he would maintain the right of a man with God, And of a son of man with his neighbor!</verse>
  <verse number="22">For when a few years are come, I shall go the way whence I shall not return.</verse>
