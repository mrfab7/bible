  <verse number="2">And I buy her to me for fifteen silverlings, and a homer and a letech of barley;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and I say unto her, ‘Many days thou dost remain for Me, thou dost not go a-whoring, nor become any one’s; and I also am for thee.’</verse>
  <verse number="4">For many days remain do the sons of Israel without a king, and there is no prince, and there is no sacrifice, and there is no standing pillar, and there is no ephod and teraphim.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Afterwards turned back have the sons of Israel, and sought Jehovah their God, and David their king, and have hastened unto Jehovah, and unto His goodness, in the latter end of the days.</verse>
