  <verse number="1">But this know, that in [the] last days difficult times shall be there;</verse>
  <verse number="2">for men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, evil speakers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, profane,</verse>
  <verse number="3">without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, of unsubdued passions, savage, having no love for what is good,</verse>
  <verse number="4">traitors, headlong, of vain pretensions, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;</verse>
  <verse number="5">having a form of piety but denying the power of it: and from these turn away.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For of these are they who are getting into houses, and leading captive silly women, laden with sins, led by various lusts,</verse>
  <verse number="7">always learning, and never able to come to [the] knowledge of [the] truth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now in the same manner in which Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, thus these also withstand the truth; men corrupted in mind, found worthless as regards the faith.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But they shall not advance farther; for their folly shall be completely manifest to all, as that of those also became.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But thou hast been thoroughly acquainted with my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, endurance,</verse>
  <verse number="11">persecutions, sufferings: what [sufferings] happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured; and the Lord delivered me out of all.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And all indeed who desire to live piously in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But wicked men and juggling impostors shall advance in evil, leading and being led astray.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But thou, abide in those things which thou hast learned, and [of which] thou hast been fully persuaded, knowing of whom thou hast learned [them];</verse>
  <verse number="15">and that from a child thou hast known the sacred letters, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith which [is] in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Every scripture [is] divinely inspired, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness;</verse>
  <verse number="17">that the man of God may be complete, fully fitted to every good work.</verse>
