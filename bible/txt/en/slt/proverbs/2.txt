1	My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and wilt hide my commands with thee;
2	To attend to wisdom thou wilt incline thine ear, thy heart to understanding;
3	For if thou will call to understanding, wilt give thy voice to understanding.
4	If thou wilt seek her as silver, and dig for her as hidden treasure;
5	Then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, and thou shalt find the knowledge of God.
6	For Jehovah will give wisdom: from his mouth knowledge and understanding.
7	He treasured up deliverance for the upright: a shield to those going in uprightness:
8	To guard the paths of judgment, and he will watch the way of his godly ones.
9	Then thou shalt understand justice and judgment and uprightness; every good track.
10	For wisdom shall come into thy heart, and knowledge shall be pleasant to thy soul.
11	Meditation shall watch over thee, understanding shall guard thee:
12	To deliver thee from the evil way, from the man speaking deceit;
13	Those forsaking the paths of straightness to go in the ways of darkness;
14	Those rejoicing to do evil will exult in the deceit of evil;
15	Whose paths are perverted, and in their tracks are bent aside:
16	To deliver thee from the strange woman, from the stranger making smooth her sayings;
17	Forsaking the friend of her youth, and forgetting the covenant of her God.
18	For her house sunk down to death, and her tracks to the shades.
19	All going in it shall not turn back, and they shall not overtake the paths of life.
20	So that thou shalt go in the way of the good, and thou shalt watch the paths of the just.
21	For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the blameless shall remain in it.
22	And the unjust shall be cut off from the land, and they transgressing shall be wiped off from it.
