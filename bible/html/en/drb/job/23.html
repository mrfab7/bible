<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Now also my words are in bitterness, and the hand of my scourge is more grievous than my mourning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Who will grant me that I might know and find him, and come even to his throne?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I would set judgment before him, and would fill my mouth with complaints.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">That I might know the words that he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I would not that he should contend with me with much strength, nor overwhelm me with the weight of his greatness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Let him propose equity against me, and let my judgment come to victory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But if I go to the east, he appeareth not; if to the west, I shall not understand him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">If to the left hand, what shall I do? I shall not take hold on him: if I turn myself to the right hand, I shall not see him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But he knoweth my way, and has tried me as gold that passeth through the fire:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My foot hath followed his steps, I have kept his way, and have not declined from it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I have not departed from the commandments of his lips, and the words of his mouth I have hid in my bosom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For he is alone, and no man can turn away his thought: and whatsoever is soul hath desired, that hath he done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And when he shall have fulfilled his will in me, many other like things are also at hand with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And therefore I am troubled at his presence, and when I consider him I am made pensive with fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">God hath softened my heart, and the Almighty hath troubled me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For I have not perished because of the darkness that hangs over me, neither hath the mist covered my face.</p>
