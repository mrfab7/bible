<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, Whose fathers I disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Yea, the strength of their hands, whereto should it profit me? Men in whom ripe age is perished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They are gaunt with want and famine; They gnaw the dry ground, in the gloom of wasteness and desolation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They pluck salt-wort with wormwood; And the roots of the broom are their food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">They are driven forth from the midst of men; They cry after them as after a thief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In the clefts of the valleys must they dwell, In holes of the earth and of the rocks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Among the bushes they bray; Under the nettles they are gathered together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They are children of churls, yea, children of ignoble men; They were scourged out of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And now I am become their song, Yea, I am a byword unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They abhor me, they flee far from me, And spare not to spit in my face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For He hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, And they have cast off the bridle before me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Upon my right hand rise the brood; They entangle my feet, And they cast up against me their ways of destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They break up my path, They further my calamity, Even men that have no helper.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">As through a wide breach they come; In the midst of the ruin they roll themselves upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Terrors are turned upon me, They chase mine honour as the wind; And my welfare is passed away as a cloud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And now my soul is poured out within me; Days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">In the night my bones are pierced, and fall from me, And my sinews take no rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">By the great force [of my disease] is my garment disfigured; It bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He hath cast me into the mire, And I am become like dust and ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I cry unto Thee, and Thou dost not answer me; I stand up, and Thou lookest at me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Thou art turned to be cruel to me; With the might of Thy hand Thou hatest me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Thou liftest me up to the wind, Thou causest me to ride upon it; And Thou dissolvest my substance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For I know that Thou wilt bring me to death, And to the house appointed for all living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Surely none shall put forth his hand to a ruinous heap, Neither because of these things shall help come in oneâ€™s calamity,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If I have not wept for him that was in trouble, And if my soul grieved not for the needy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Yet, when I looked for good, there came evil; And when I waited for light, there came darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Mine inwards boil, and rest not; Days of affliction are come upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">I go mourning without the sun; I stand up in the assembly, and cry for help.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">I am become a brother to jackals, And a companion to ostriches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">My skin is black, and falleth from me, And my bones are burned with heat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Therefore is my harp turned to mourning, And my pipe into the voice of them that weep.</p>
