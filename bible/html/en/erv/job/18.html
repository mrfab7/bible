<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How long will ye lay snares for words? consider, and afterwards we will speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and are become unclean in your sight?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger, shall the earth be forsaken for thee? or shall the rock be removed out of its place?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The light shall be dark in his tent, and his lamp above him shall be put out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon the toils.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A gin shall take him by the heel, and a snare shall lay hold on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A noose is hid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall chase him at his heels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">His strength shall be hunger-bitten and calamity shall be ready for his halting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">It shall devour the members of his body, yea, the firstborn of death shall devour his members.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He shall be rooted out of his tent wherein he trusteth; and he shall be brought to the king of terrors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">There shall dwell in his tent that which is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He shall have neither son nor sonâ€™s son among his people, nor any remaining where he sojourned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">They that come after shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.</p>
