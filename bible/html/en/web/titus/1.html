<div class="chapter" data-book="Titus" data-chapter="1" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s chosen ones, and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">in hope of eternal life, which God, who can’t lie, promised before time began;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">but in his own time revealed his word in the message with which I was entrusted according to the commandment of God our Savior;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">to Titus, my true child according to a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I left you in Crete for this reason, that you would set in order the things that were lacking, and appoint elders in every city, as I directed you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">if anyone is blameless, the husband of one wife, having children who believe, who are not accused of loose or unruly behavior.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For the overseer must be blameless, as God’s steward; not self-pleasing, not easily angered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for dishonest gain;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">but given to hospitality, a lover of good, sober minded, fair, holy, self-controlled;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">holding to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to exhort in the sound doctrine, and to convict those who contradict him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For there are also many unruly men, vain talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">whose mouths must be stopped; men who overthrow whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">One of them, a prophet of their own, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, and idle gluttons.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">This testimony is true. For this cause, reprove them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">not paying attention to Jewish fables and commandments of men who turn away from the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">To the pure, all things are pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">They profess that they know God, but by their works they deny him, being abominable, disobedient, and unfit for any good work.</p>
