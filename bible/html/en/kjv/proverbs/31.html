<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">[It is] not for kings, O Lemuel, [it is] not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price [is] far above rubies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">She is like the merchantsâ€™ ships; she bringeth her food from afar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">She perceiveth that her merchandise [is] good: her candle goeth not out by night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household [are] clothed with scarlet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing [is] silk and purple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">She maketh fine linen, and selleth [it]; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Strength and honour [are] her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue [is] the law of kindness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband [also], and he praiseth her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Favour [is] deceitful, and beauty [is] vain: [but] a woman [that] feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.</p>
