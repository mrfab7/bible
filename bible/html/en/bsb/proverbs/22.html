<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A good name is more desirable than great riches; favor is better than silver and gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The rich and the poor have this in common: The LORD is Maker of them all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The prudent see danger and take cover, but the simple keep going and suffer the consequences.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The rewards of humility and the fear of the LORD are wealth and honor and life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thorns and snares lie on the path of the perverse; he who guards his soul stays far from them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The rich rule over the poor, and the borrower is slave to the lender.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He who sows injustice will reap disaster, and the rod of his fury will be destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A generous man will be blessed, for he shares his bread with the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Drive out the mocker, and conflict will depart; even quarreling and insults will cease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He who loves a pure heart and gracious lips will have the king for a friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The LORD’s eyes keep watch over knowledge, but He frustrates the words of the faithless.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The slacker says, “There is a lion outside! I will be slain in the streets!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit; he who is under the wrath of the LORD will fall into it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child, but the rod of discipline drives it far from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Oppressing the poor to enrich oneself or giving gifts to the rich will surely lead to poverty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Incline your ear and hear the words of the wise—apply your mind to my knowledge—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">for it is pleasing when you keep them within you and they are constantly on your lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">So that your trust may be in the LORD, I instruct you today—yes, you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Have I not written for you thirty sayings about counsel and knowledge,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">to show you true and reliable words, that you may soundly answer those who sent you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Do not rob a poor man because he is poor, and do not crush the afflicted at the gate,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">for the LORD will take up their case and will plunder those who rob them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Do not make friends with an angry man, and do not associate with a hot-tempered man,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">or you may learn his ways and entangle yourself in a snare.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Do not be one who gives pledges, who puts up security for debts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">If you have nothing with which to pay, why should your bed be taken from under you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Do not move an ancient boundary stone which your fathers have placed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Do you see a man skilled in his work? He will be stationed in the presence of kings; he will not stand before obscure men.</p>
