  <verse number="1">Then the LORD said to Moses,</verse>
  <verse number="2">“See, I have called by name Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with skill, ability, and knowledge in all kinds of craftsmanship,</verse>
  <verse number="4">to design artistic works in gold, silver, and bronze,</verse>
  <verse number="5">to cut gemstones for settings, and to carve wood, so that he may be a master of every craft.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Moreover, I have selected Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, as his assistant. I have also given skill to all the craftsmen, that they may fashion all that I have commanded you:</verse>
  <verse number="7">the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the Testimony and the mercy seat upon it, and all the other furnishings of the tent—</verse>
  <verse number="8">the table with its utensils, the pure gold lampstand with all its utensils, the altar of incense,</verse>
  <verse number="9">the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin with its stand—</verse>
  <verse number="10">as well as the woven garments, both the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons to serve as priests,</verse>
  <verse number="11">in addition to the anointing oil and fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them according to all that I have commanded you.”</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the LORD said to Moses,</verse>
  <verse number="13">“Tell the Israelites, ‘Surely you must keep My Sabbaths, for this will be a sign between Me and you for the generations to come, so that you may know that I am the LORD who sanctifies you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Keep the Sabbath, for it is holy to you. Anyone who profanes it must surely be put to death. Whoever does any work on that day must be cut off from among his people.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For six days work may be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of complete rest, holy to the LORD. Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day must surely be put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The Israelites must keep the Sabbath, celebrating it as a permanent covenant for the generations to come.</verse>
  <verse number="17">It is a sign between Me and the Israelites forever; for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, but on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed.’”</verse>
  <verse number="18">When the LORD had finished speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai, He gave him the two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of God.</verse>
