<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“Isn’t a man forced to labor on earth? Aren’t his days like the days of a hired hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow, as a hireling who looks for his wages,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">so am I made to possess months of misery, wearisome nights are appointed to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">When I lie down, I say, ‘When shall I arise, and the night be gone?’ I toss and turn until the dawning of the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust. My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Oh remember that my life is a breath. My eye shall no more see good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The eye of him who sees me shall see me no more. Your eyes shall be on me, but I shall not be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he who goes down to Sheol shall come up no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">“Therefore I will not keep silent. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit. I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Am I a sea, or a sea monster, that you put a guard over me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">When I say, ‘My bed shall comfort me. My couch shall ease my complaint;’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">then you scare me with dreams, and terrify me through visions:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">so that my soul chooses strangling, death rather than my bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I loathe my life. I don’t want to live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">What is man, that you should magnify him, that you should set your mind on him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">that you should visit him every morning, and test him every moment?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">How long will you not look away from me, nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">If I have sinned, what do I do to you, you watcher of men? Why have you set me as a mark for you, so that I am a burden to myself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Why do you not pardon my disobedience, and take away my iniquity? For now shall I lie down in the dust. You will seek me diligently, but I shall not be.”</p>
