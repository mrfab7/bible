<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! When thou hast ceased to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou hast made an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">At the noise of the tumult the peoples are fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations are scattered.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And there shall be stability in thy times, abundance of salvation, wisdom and knowledge: the fear of the LORD is his treasure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, their valiant ones cry without: the ambassadors of peace weep bitterly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth not man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The land mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and withereth away: Sharon is like a desert; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">How will I arise, saith the LORD; now will I lift up myself; now will I be exalted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath is a fire that shall devour you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut down, that are burned in the fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The sinners in Zion are afraid; trembling hath surprised the godless ones. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: his bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold a far stretching land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Thine heart shall muse on the terror: where is he that counted, where is he that weighed the tribute? where is he that counted the towers?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thou shalt not see the fierce people, a people of a deep speech that thou canst not perceive; of a strange tongue that thou canst not understand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tent that shall not be removed, the stakes whereof shall never be plucked up, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But there the LORD will be with us in majesty, a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; he will save us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not strengthen the foot of their mast, they could not spread the sail: then was the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame took the prey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.</p>
