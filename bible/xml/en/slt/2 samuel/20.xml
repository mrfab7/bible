  <verse number="1">And a man of Belial was met with there, and his name Sheba, son of Bichri, a man, a Jaminite: and he will strike upon the trumpet and say, No portion to us in David, and no inheritance to us in the son of Jesse: a man to his tent to Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And every man of Israel will go up from after David, after Sheba, son of Bichri: and the men of Judah were joined to the king, from Jordan and even to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And David will come to his house to Jerusalem; and the king will take the ten women, the concubines which he left to watch the house, and he will give them to the house of watch, and he will nourish them, and he went not in to them. And they will be bound together till the day of their death to live widows.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the king will say to Amasa, Call together to me the men of Judah in three days, and stand thou here.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Amasa will go to call Judah together: and he will delay from the appointment which he appointed him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And David will say to Abishai, Now Sheba son of Bichri will do evil to us above Absalom: take thou thy lord’s servants and go down after him, lest finding to himself fortified cities and he shadow our eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Joab’s men went forth after him, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and all the mighty went forth from Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba son of Bichri.</verse>
  <verse number="8">They by the great stone which is in the hill, and Amasa went before them. And Joab girded his garment being put upon him, and upon it he girded the sword being bound upon his loins in its sheath; and he going forth and it will fall.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Joab will say to Amasa, Thou my brother in peace? and Joab’s right hand will take hold of Amasa by the beard to kiss him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Amasa watched not upon the sword which was in Joab’s hand: and he will strike him with it into the belly, and his bowels will be poured forth to the earth; and he repeated not to him; and he will die. And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba son of Bichri.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And a man from Joab’s boys stood by him, and he will say, Who delighted in Joab, and who that is for David, after Joab.</verse>

  <verse number="13">When he was taken away from the highway every man passed by after Joab to pursue after Sheba son of Bichri.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he will pass through in all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to the house of oppression, and all the Berites: and they will be called together, and they will go also after him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And they will come and besiege against him in Abel of the house of oppression, and they will pour out a mound against the city, and it will stand in the fortification: and all the people which were with Joab laying waste to throw down the wall.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And a wise woman will call out of the city, Hear ye, hear ye; say now to Joab, Come near hither and I will speak to you.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he will draw near to her, and the woman will say, Art thou Joab? and he will say, I. And she will say to him, Hear the words of thy servant And he will say, I hear.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And she will say, saying, They will speak the word in the beginning, saying, They will ask an asking in Abel: and thus they finished.</verse>
  <verse number="19">I peaceful of the faithful of Israel: thou seeking to kill a city and a mother in Israel: wherefore wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of Jehovah?</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Joab will say, Far be it, far be it to me, if I shall swallow up and if I shall destroy.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Not thus the word; for a man from mount Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri, his name, lifted up his hand against the king, against David: ye shall give him only, and I will go from the city. And the woman will say to Joab, Behold, his head being cast to thee behind the wall.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the woman will go to all the people in her wisdom: and they will cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and cast to Joab. And he will strike upon the trumpet, and they will disperse from the city, a man to his tent. And Joab turned back to Jerusalem to the king.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Joab over all the army of Israel: and Benaiah, son of Jehoida, over the Cherethites, and over the Pelethites.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Adoniram over the tribute: and Jehoshaphat, son of Ahilud, calling to mind:</verse>
  <verse number="25">And Sheva the scribe: and Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</verse>
