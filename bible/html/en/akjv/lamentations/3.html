<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I AM the man that has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">He has led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Surely against me is he turned; he turns his hand against me all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">My flesh and my skin has he made old; he has broken my bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He has built against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He has set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He has hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he has made my chain heavy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Also when I cry and shout, he shuts out my prayer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He has enclosed my ways with hewn stone, he has made my paths crooked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He was to me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He has turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he has made me desolate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He has caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He has filled me with bitterness, he has made me drunken with wormwood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He has also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he has covered me with ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And you have removed my soul far off from peace: I forgot prosperity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Remembering my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My soul has them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">It is of the LORDâ€™s mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">They are new every morning: great is your faithfulness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The LORD is my portion, said my soul; therefore will I hope in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The LORD is good to them that wait for him, to the soul that seeks him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">It is good for a man that he bear the yoke of his youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He sits alone and keeps silence, because he has borne it on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He puts his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He gives his cheek to him that smites him: he is filled full with reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For the LORD will not cast off for ever:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">For he does not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approves not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Who is he that said, and it comes to pass, when the Lord commands it not?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">Out of the mouth of the most High proceeds not evil and good?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Why does a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Let us lift up our heart with our hands to God in the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">We have transgressed and have rebelled: you have not pardoned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">You have covered with anger, and persecuted us: you have slain, you have not pitied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">You have covered yourself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">You have made us as the offscouring and refuse in the middle of the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">Fear and a snare is come on us, desolation and destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">My eye runs down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">My eye trickles down, and ceases not, without any intermission.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">My eye affects my heart because of all the daughters of my city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">My enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone on me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">Waters flowed over my head; then I said, I am cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">I called on your name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">You have heard my voice: hide not your ear at my breathing, at my cry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="57">You drew near in the day that I called on you: you said, Fear not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="58">O LORD, you have pleaded the causes of my soul; you have redeemed my life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="59">O LORD, you have seen my wrong: judge you my cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="60">You have seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="61">You have heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="62">The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="63">Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their music.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="64">Render to them a recompense, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="65">Give them sorrow of heart, your curse to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="66">Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.</p>
