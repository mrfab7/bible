<chapter book="Proverbs" number="25" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.</verse>
  <verse number="2">It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honor of kings is to search out a matter.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Put not forth yourself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:</verse>
  <verse number="7">For better it is that it be said to you, Come up here; than that you should be put lower in the presence of the prince whom your eyes have seen.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Go not forth hastily to strive, lest you know not what to do in the end thereof, when your neighbor has put you to shame.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Debate your cause with your neighbor himself; and discover not a secret to another:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Lest he that hears it put you to shame, and your infamy turn not away.</verse>
  <verse number="11">A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="12">As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover on an obedient ear.</verse>
  <verse number="13">As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refreshes the soul of his masters.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Whoever boasts himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.</verse>
  <verse number="15">By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaks the bone.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Have you found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for you, lest you be filled therewith, and vomit it.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Withdraw your foot from your neighbor’s house; lest he be weary of you, and so hate you.</verse>
  <verse number="18">A man that bears false witness against his neighbor is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.</verse>
  <verse number="20">As he that takes away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar on nitre, so is he that singes songs to an heavy heart.</verse>
  <verse number="21">If your enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:</verse>
  <verse number="22">For you shall heap coals of fire on his head, and the LORD shall reward you.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The north wind drives away rain: so does an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.</verse>
  <verse number="24">It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.</verse>
  <verse number="25">As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.</verse>
  <verse number="26">A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.</verse>
  <verse number="27">It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory.</verse>
  <verse number="28">He that has no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.</verse>
