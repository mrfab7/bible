<div class="chapter" data-book="Amos" data-chapter="5" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Hear you this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken on her land; there is none to raise her up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For thus said the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For thus said the LORD to the house of Israel, Seek you me, and you shall live:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Seek the LORD, and you shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">You who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Seek him that makes the seven stars and Orion, and turns the shadow of death into the morning, and makes the day dark with night: that calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">That strengthens the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They hate him that rebukes in the gate, and they abhor him that speaks uprightly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For as much therefore as your treading is on the poor, and you take from him burdens of wheat: you have built houses of hewn stone, but you shall not dwell in them; you have planted pleasant vineyards, but you shall not drink wine of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Seek good, and not evil, that you may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as you have spoken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, said thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the farmer to mourning, and such as are skillful of lamentation to wailing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through you, said the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Woe to you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Though you offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Take you away from me the noise of your songs; for I will not hear the melody of your viols.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Have you offered to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But you have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, said the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.</p>
