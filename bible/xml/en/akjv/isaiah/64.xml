<chapter book="Isaiah" number="64" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Oh that you would rend the heavens, that you would come down, that the mountains might flow down at your presence,</verse>
  <verse number="2">As when the melting fire burns, the fire causes the waters to boil, to make your name known to your adversaries, that the nations may tremble at your presence!</verse>
  <verse number="3">When you did terrible things which we looked not for, you came down, the mountains flowed down at your presence.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen, O God, beside you, what he has prepared for him that waits for him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">You meet him that rejoices and works righteousness, those that remember you in your ways: behold, you are wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And there is none that calls on your name, that stirs up himself to take hold of you: for you have hid your face from us, and have consumed us, because of our iniquities.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But now, O LORD, you are our father; we are the clay, and you our potter; and we all are the work of your hand.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech you, we are all your people.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Your holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised you, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Will you refrain yourself for these things, O LORD? will you hold your peace, and afflict us very sore?</verse>
