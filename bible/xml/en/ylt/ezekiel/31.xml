  <verse number="1">And it cometh to pass, in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first of the month, hath a word of Jehovah been unto me, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="2">‘Son of man, say unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and unto his multitude: To whom hast thou been like in thy greatness?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Lo, Asshur, a cedar in Lebanon, Fair in branch, and shading bough, and high in stature, And between thickets hath its foliage been.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Waters have made it great, The deep hath exalted him with its flowings, Going round about its planting, And its conduits it hath sent forth unto all trees of the field.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Therefore higher hath been his stature than all trees of the field, And multiplied are his boughs, and long are his branches, Because of many waters in his shooting forth,</verse>
  <verse number="6">In his boughs made a nest hath every fowl of the heavens, And under his branches brought forth hath every beast of the field, And in his shade dwell do all great nations.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he is fair in his greatness, In the length of his thin shoots, For his root hath been by great waters.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Cedars have not hid him in the garden of God, Firs have not been like unto his boughs, And chesnut-trees have not been as his branches, No tree in the garden of God hath been like unto him in his beauty,</verse>
  <verse number="9">Fair I have made him in the multitude of his thin shoots, And envy him do all trees of Eden that are in the garden of God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because that thou hast been high in stature, And he yieldeth his foliage between thickets, And high is his heart in his haughtiness,</verse>
  <verse number="11">I give him into the hand of a god of nations, He dealeth sorely with him, In his wickedness I have cast him out.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And cut him off do strangers, The terrible of nations, and they leave him, On the mountains and in all valleys have his thin shoots fallen, And broken are his boughs at all streams of the land, And go down from his shade do all peoples of the land, and they leave him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">On his ruin dwell do all fowls of the heavens, And on his boughs have been all the beasts of the field,</verse>
  <verse number="14">In order that none of the trees of the waters May become haughty because of their stature, Nor give their foliage between thickets, Nor any drinking waters stand up unto them in their haughtiness, For all of them are given up to death, Unto the earth—the lower part, In the midst of the sons of men, Unto those going down to the pit.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In the day of his going down to sheol I have caused mourning, I have covered for him the deep, and diminish its flowings, And restrained are many waters, And I make Lebanon black for him, And all trees of the field have been covered for him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">From the sound of his fall I have caused nations to shake, In My causing him to go down to sheol, With those going down to the pit, And comforted in the earth—the lower part, are all trees of Eden, The choice and the good of Lebanon, All drinking waters.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Also they with him have gone down to sheol, Unto the pierced of the sword, And—his arm—they dwelt in his shade in the midst of nations.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Unto whom hast thou been thus like, In honour and in greatness among the trees of Eden, And thou hast been brought down with the trees of Eden, Unto the earth—the lower part, In the midst of the uncircumcised thou liest, With the pierced of the sword? It is Pharaoh, and all his multitude, An affirmation of the Lord Jehovah!’</verse>
