  <verse number="1">And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, and with every leader.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And David said to all the congregation of Israel, If it seem good to you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send abroad to our brothers every where, that are left in all the land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather themselves to us:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</verse>
  <verse number="5">So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even to the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up there the ark of God the LORD, that dwells between the cherubim, whose name is called on it.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with tambourines, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And when they came to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach on Uzza: why that place is called Perezuzza to this day.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?</verse>
  <verse number="13">So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the Gittite.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of Obededom, and all that he had.</verse>
