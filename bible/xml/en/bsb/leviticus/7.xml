<chapter book="Leviticus" number="7" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">“Now this is the law of the guilt offering, which is most holy:</verse>
  <verse number="2">The guilt offering must be slaughtered in the place where the burnt offering is slaughtered, and the priest shall splatter its blood on all sides of the altar.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And all the fat from it shall be offered: the fat tail, the fat that covers the entrails,</verse>
  <verse number="4">both kidneys with the fat on them near the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which is to be removed with the kidneys.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The priest shall burn them on the altar as a food offering to the LORD; it is a guilt offering.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Every male among the priests may eat of it. It must be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The guilt offering is like the sin offering; the same law applies to both. It belongs to the priest who makes atonement with it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">As for the priest who presents a burnt offering for anyone, the hide of that offering belongs to him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Likewise, every grain offering that is baked in an oven or cooked in a pan or on a griddle belongs to the priest who presents it,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and every grain offering, whether dry or mixed with oil, belongs equally to all the sons of Aaron.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Now this is the law of the peace offering that one may present to the LORD:</verse>
  <verse number="12">If he offers it in thanksgiving, then along with the sacrifice of thanksgiving he shall offer unleavened cakes mixed with olive oil, unleavened wafers coated with oil, and well-kneaded cakes of fine flour mixed with oil.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Along with his peace offering of thanksgiving he is to present an offering with cakes of leavened bread.</verse>
  <verse number="14">From the cakes he must present one portion of each offering as a contribution to the LORD. It belongs to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offering.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The meat of the sacrifice of his peace offering of thanksgiving must be eaten on the day he offers it; none of it may be left until morning.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If, however, the sacrifice he offers is a vow or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day he presents his sacrifice, but the remainder may be eaten on the next day.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But any meat of the sacrifice remaining until the third day must be burned up.</verse>
  <verse number="18">If any of the meat from his peace offering is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted. It will not be credited to the one who presented it; it shall be an abomination, and the one who eats of it shall bear his iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Meat that touches anything unclean must not be eaten; it is to be burned up. As for any other meat, anyone who is ceremonially clean may eat it.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But if anyone who is unclean eats meat from the peace offering that belongs to the LORD, that person must be cut off from his people.</verse>
  <verse number="21">If one touches anything unclean, whether human uncleanness, an unclean animal, or any unclean, detestable thing, and then eats any of the meat of the peace offering that belongs to the LORD, that person must be cut off from his people.”</verse>
  <verse number="22">Then the LORD said to Moses,</verse>
  <verse number="23">“Speak to the Israelites and say, ‘You are not to eat any of the fat of an ox, a sheep, or a goat.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The fat of an animal found dead or mauled by wild beasts may be used for any other purpose, but you must not eat it.</verse>
  <verse number="25">If anyone eats the fat of an animal from which a food offering may be presented to the LORD, the one who eats it must be cut off from his people.</verse>
  <verse number="26">You must not eat the blood of any bird or animal in any of your dwellings.</verse>
  <verse number="27">If anyone eats blood, that person must be cut off from his people.’”</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then the LORD said to Moses,</verse>
  <verse number="29">“Speak to the Israelites and say, ‘Anyone who presents a peace offering to the LORD must bring it as his sacrifice to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="30">With his own hands he is to bring the food offerings to the LORD; he shall bring the fat, together with the breast, and wave the breast as a wave offering before the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="31">The priest is to burn the fat on the altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And you are to give the right thigh to the priest as a contribution from your peace offering.</verse>
  <verse number="33">The son of Aaron who presents the blood and fat of the peace offering shall have the right thigh as a portion.</verse>
  <verse number="34">I have taken from the sons of Israel the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution of their peace offerings, and I have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons as a permanent portion from the sons of Israel.’”</verse>
  <verse number="35">This is the portion of the food offerings to the LORD for Aaron and his sons since the day they were presented to serve the LORD as priests.</verse>
  <verse number="36">On the day they were anointed, the LORD commanded that this be given them by the sons of Israel. It is a permanent portion for the generations to come.</verse>
  <verse number="37">This is the law of the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the ordination offering, and the peace offering,</verse>
  <verse number="38">which the LORD gave Moses on Mount Sinai on the day He commanded the Israelites to present their offerings to the LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai.</verse>
