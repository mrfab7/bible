1	The son of twenty and five years was Jotham in his reigning, and sixteen years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his motherâ€™s name Jerushah, daughter of Zadok.
2	And he will do the straight in the eyes of Jehovah, according to all which Uzziah his father did: only he came not into the temple of Jehovah. And the people yet being corrupted.
3	He built the gate of the house of Jehovah the highest, and upon the wall of Ophel he built for multitude.
4	And he built cities in the mountain of Judah, and in the thickets he built fortresses and towers.
5	And he waged war with the king of the sons of Ammon, and he will be strong against them. And the sons of Ammon will give to him in that year a hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand cors of wheat, and barley ten thousand. This the sons of Ammon turned back to him, in the second year, and the third.
6	And Jotham will be strengthened, for he prepared his ways before Jehovah his God.
7	And the rest of the words of Jotham, and all his works and his ways, behold them written upon the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
8	The son of twenty and five years was he in his reigning, and sixteen years reigned he in Jerusalem.
9	And Jotham will lie down with his fathers, and they will bury him in the city of David: and Ahaz his son will reign in his stead.
