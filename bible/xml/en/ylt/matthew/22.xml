  <verse number="1">And Jesus answering, again spake to them in similes, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">‘The reign of the heavens was likened to a man, a king, who made marriage-feasts for his son,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and he sent forth his servants to call those having been called to the marriage-feasts, and they were not willing to come.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Say to those who have been called: Lo, my dinner I prepared, my oxen and the fatlings have been killed, and all things are ready, come ye to the marriage-feasts;</verse>
  <verse number="5">and they, having disregarded it, went away, the one to his own field, and the other to his merchandise;</verse>
  <verse number="6">and the rest, having laid hold on his servants, did insult and slay them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">‘And the king having heard, was wroth, and having sent forth his soldiers, he destroyed those murderers, and their city he set on fire;</verse>
  <verse number="8">then saith he to his servants, The marriage-feast indeed is ready, and those called were not worthy,</verse>
  <verse number="9">be going, then, on to the cross-ways, and as many as ye may find, call ye to the marriage-feasts.</verse>
  <verse number="10">‘And those servants, having gone forth to the ways, did gather all, as many as they found, both bad and good, and the marriage-feast apartment was filled with those reclining.</verse>
  <verse number="11">‘And the king having come in to view those reclining, saw there a man not clothed with clothing of the marriage-feast,</verse>
  <verse number="12">and he saith to him, Comrade, how didst thou come in hither, not having clothing of the marriage-feast? and he was speechless.</verse>
  <verse number="13">‘Then said the king to the ministrants, Having bound his feet and hands, take him up and cast forth to the outer darkness, there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of the teeth;</verse>
  <verse number="14">for many are called, and few chosen.’</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then the Pharisees having gone, took counsel how they might ensnare him in words,</verse>
  <verse number="16">and they send to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, ‘Teacher, we have known that thou art true, and the way of God in truth thou dost teach, and thou art not caring for any one, for thou dost not look to the face of men;</verse>
  <verse number="17">tell us, therefore, what dost thou think? is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not?’</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Jesus having known their wickedness, said, ‘Why me do ye tempt, hypocrites?</verse>
  <verse number="19">show me the tribute-coin?’ and they brought to him a denary;</verse>
  <verse number="20">and he saith to them, ‘Whose is this image and the inscription?’</verse>
  <verse number="21">they say to him, ‘Caesar’s;’ then saith he to them, ‘Render therefore the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God;’</verse>
  <verse number="22">and having heard they wondered, and having left him they went away.</verse>
  <verse number="23">In that day there came near to him Sadducees, who are saying there is not a rising again, and they questioned him, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="24">‘Teacher, Moses said, If any one may die not having children, his brother shall marry his wife, and shall raise up seed to his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="25">‘And there were with us seven brothers, and the first having married did die, and not having seed, he left his wife to his brother;</verse>
  <verse number="26">in like manner also the second, and the third, unto the seventh,</verse>
  <verse number="27">and last of all died also the woman;</verse>
  <verse number="28">therefore in the rising again, of which of the seven shall she be wife—for all had her?’</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Jesus answering said to them, ‘Ye go astray, not knowing the Writings, nor the power of God;</verse>
  <verse number="30">for in the rising again they do not marry, nor are they given in marriage, but are as messengers of God in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="31">‘And concerning the rising again of the dead, did ye not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="32">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not a God of dead men, but of living.’</verse>
  <verse number="33">And having heard, the multitudes were astonished at his teaching;</verse>
  <verse number="34">and the Pharisees, having heard that he did silence the Sadducees, were gathered together unto him;</verse>
  <verse number="35">and one of them, a lawyer, did question, tempting him, and saying,</verse>
  <verse number="36">Teacher, which is the great command in the Law?’</verse>
  <verse number="37">And Jesus said to him, ‘Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thine understanding—</verse>
  <verse number="38">this is a first and great command;</verse>
  <verse number="39">and the second is like to it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;</verse>
  <verse number="40">on these—the two commands—all the law and the prophets do hang.’</verse>
  <verse number="41">And the Pharisees having been gathered together, Jesus did question them,</verse>
  <verse number="42">saying, ‘What do ye think concerning the Christ? of whom is he son?’ They say to him, ‘Of David.’</verse>
  <verse number="43">He saith to them, ‘How then doth David in the Spirit call him lord, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="44">The Lord said to my lord, Sit at my right hand, till I may make thine enemies thy footstool?</verse>
  <verse number="45">If then David doth call him lord, how is he his son?’</verse>
  <verse number="46">And no one was able to answer him a word, nor durst any from that day question him any more.</verse>
