  <verse number="19">And Joseph her husband being just, and not willing to expose her to disgrace, wished to let her go in secret.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And reflecting upon these things, behold a messenger of the Lord appeared to him saying, Joseph, thou son of David, thou shouldest not fear to take to thyself Mary thy wife: for that begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus; for he shall save his people from their sins,</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the whole of this has been that it might be completed having been spoken by the prophet, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is, being interpreted, God with us.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Joseph having awaked from sleep, did as the messenger of the Lord commanded him:</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he took to himself his wife, and knew her not till she brought forth her first born son: and be called his name Jesus.</verse>
