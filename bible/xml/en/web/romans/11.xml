  <verse number="1">I ask then, did God reject his people? May it never be! For I also am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
  <verse number="2">God didn’t reject his people, which he foreknew. Or don’t you know what the Scripture says about Elijah? How he pleads with God against Israel:</verse>
  <verse number="3">“Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have broken down your altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">But how does God answer him? “I have reserved for myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to Baal.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work.</verse>
  <verse number="7">What then? That which Israel seeks for, that he didn’t obtain, but the chosen ones obtained it, and the rest were hardened.</verse>
  <verse number="8">According as it is written, “God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, to this very day.”</verse>
  <verse number="9">David says, “Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, a stumbling block, and a retribution to them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see. Bow down their back always.”</verse>
  <verse number="11">I ask then, did they stumble that they might fall? May it never be! But by their fall salvation has come to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now if their fall is the riches of the world, and their loss the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fullness?</verse>
  <verse number="13">For I speak to you who are Gentiles. Since then as I am an apostle to Gentiles, I glorify my ministry;</verse>
  <verse number="14">if by any means I may provoke to jealousy those who are my flesh, and may save some of them.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For if the rejection of them is the reconciling of the world, what would their acceptance be, but life from the dead?</verse>
  <verse number="16">If the first fruit is holy, so is the lump. If the root is holy, so are the branches.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them, and became partaker with them of the root and of the richness of the olive tree;</verse>
  <verse number="18">don’t boast over the branches. But if you boast, it is not you who support the root, but the root supports you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">You will say then, “Branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.”</verse>
  <verse number="20">True; by their unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by your faith. Don’t be conceited, but fear;</verse>
  <verse number="21">for if God didn’t spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.</verse>
  <verse number="22">See then the goodness and severity of God. Toward those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness; otherwise you also will be cut off.</verse>
  <verse number="23">They also, if they don’t continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For if you were cut out of that which is by nature a wild olive tree, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree, how much more will these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?</verse>
  <verse number="25">For I don’t desire you to be ignorant, brothers, of this mystery, so that you won’t be wise in your own conceits, that a partial hardening has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in,</verse>
  <verse number="26">and so all Israel will be saved. Even as it is written, “There will come out of Zion the Deliverer, and he will turn away ungodliness from Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="27">This is my covenant to them, when I will take away their sins.”</verse>
  <verse number="28">Concerning the Good News, they are enemies for your sake. But concerning the election, they are beloved for the fathers’ sake.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For as you in time past were disobedient to God, but now have obtained mercy by their disobedience,</verse>
  <verse number="31">even so these also have now been disobedient, that by the mercy shown to you they may also obtain mercy.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For God has shut up all to disobedience, that he might have mercy on all.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past tracing out!</verse>
  <verse number="34">“For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor?”</verse>
  <verse number="35">“Or who has first given to him, and it will be repaid to him again?”</verse>
  <verse number="36">For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things. To him be the glory for ever! Amen.</verse>
