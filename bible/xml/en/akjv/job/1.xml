<chapter book="Job" number="1" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
  <verse number="3">His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the LORD said to Satan, From where come you? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the LORD said to Satan, Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that fears God, and eschews evil?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Does Job fear God for nothing?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Have not you made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he has on every side? you have blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But put forth your hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he has is in your power; only on himself put not forth your hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house:</verse>
  <verse number="14">And there came a messenger to Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the Sabeans fell on them, and took them away; yes, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.</verse>
  <verse number="16">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and has burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.</verse>
  <verse number="17">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell on the camels, and have carried them away, yes, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.</verse>
  <verse number="18">While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Your sons and your daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house:</verse>
  <verse number="19">And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell on the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell you.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down on the ground, and worshipped,</verse>
  <verse number="21">And said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="22">In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</verse>
