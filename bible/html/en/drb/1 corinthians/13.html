<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="13" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">IF I speak with the tongues of men, and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And if I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries, and all knowledge, and if I should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And if I should distribute all my goods to feed the poor, and if I should deliver my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Charity is patient, is kind: charity envieth not, dealeth not perversely; is not puffed up;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Is not ambitious, seeketh not her own, is not provoked to anger, thinketh no evil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth with the truth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Charity never falleth away: whether prophecies shall be made void, or tongues shall cease, or knowledge shall be destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But when that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall be done away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But, when I became a man, I put away the things of a child.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">We see now through a glass in a dark manner; but then face to face. Now I know I part; but then I shall know even as I am known.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And now there remain faith, hope, and charity, these three: but the greatest of these is charity.</p>
