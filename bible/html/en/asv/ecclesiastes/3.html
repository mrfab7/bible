<div class="chapter" data-book="Ecclesiastes" data-chapter="3" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He hath made everything beautiful in its time: also he hath set eternity in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that God hath done from the beginning even to the end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to do good so long as they live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it; and God hath done it, that men should fear before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">That which is hath been long ago; and that which is to be hath long ago been: and God seeketh again that which is passed away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I said in my heart, It is because of the sons of men, that God may prove them, and that they may see that they themselves are but as beasts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; and man hath no preeminence above the beasts: for all is vanity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Who knoweth the spirit of man, whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast, whether it goeth downward to the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Wherefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him back to see what shall be after him?</p>
