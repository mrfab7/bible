<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Woe to her that is rebellious and polluted! to the oppressing city!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in Jehovah; she drew not near to her God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they leave nothing till the morrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Her prophets are light and treacherous persons; her priests have profaned the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Jehovah in the midst of her is righteous; he will not do iniquity; every morning doth he bring his justice to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I have cut off nations; their battlements are desolate; I have made their streets waste, so that none passeth by; their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I said, Only fear thou me; receive correction; so her dwelling shall not be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her: but they rose early and corrupted all their doings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Therefore wait ye for me, saith Jehovah, until the day that I rise up to the prey; for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For then will I turn to the peoples of a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of Jehovah, to serve him with one consent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">In that day shalt thou not be put to shame for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me; for then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proudly exulting ones, and thou shalt no more be haughty in my holy mountain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall take refuge in the name of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth; for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Jehovah hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the King of Israel, even Jehovah, is in the midst of thee; thou shalt not fear evil any more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not; O Zion, let not thy hands be slack.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Jehovah thy God is in the midst of thee, a mighty one who will save; he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love; he will joy over thee with singing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I will gather them that sorrow for the solemn assembly, who were of thee; to whom the burden upon her was a reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee; and I will save that which is lame, and gather that which was driven away; and I will make them a praise and a name, whose shame hath been in all the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">At that time I will bring you in, and at that time I will gather you; for I will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I bring back your captivity before your eyes, saith Jehovah.</p>
