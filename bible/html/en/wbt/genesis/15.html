<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and lo, one born in my house is my heir.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And behold, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, This shall not be thy heir; but he that shall come forth out of thy own bowels shall be thy heir.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now towards heaven, and tell the stars, if thou art able to number them: and he said to him, So shall thy seed be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he said to him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he said, Lord GOD, by what shall I know that I shall inherit it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he said to him, Take me a heifer of three years old, and a she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he took to him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds he did not divide.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and lo, a horror of great darkness fell upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And he said to Abram, Know certainly that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And also that nation which they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And it came to pass, that when the sun had gone down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">In that same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, To thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.</p>
