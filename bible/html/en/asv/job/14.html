<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Man, that is born of a woman, Is of few days, and full of trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: He fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one, And bringest me into judgment with thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Seeing his days are determined, The number of his months is with thee, And thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Look away from him, that he may rest, Till he shall accomplish, as a hireling, his day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For there is hope of a tree, If it be cut down, that it will sprout again, And that the tender branch thereof will not cease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, And the stock thereof die in the ground;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Yet through the scent of water it will bud, And put forth boughs like a plant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But man dieth, and is laid low: Yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">As the waters fail from the sea, And the river wasteth and drieth up;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">So man lieth down and riseth not: Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, Nor be roused out of their sleep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Oh that thou wouldest hide me in Sheol, That thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, That thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my warfare would I wait, Till my release should come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thou wouldest call, and I would answer thee: Thou wouldest have a desire to the work of thy hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But now thou numberest my steps: Dost thou not watch over my sin?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">My transgression is sealed up in a bag, And thou fastenest up mine iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But the mountain falling cometh to nought; And the rock is removed out of its place;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The waters wear the stones; The overflowings thereof wash away the dust of the earth: So thou destroyest the hope of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth; Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His sons come to honor, and he knoweth it not; And they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But his flesh upon him hath pain, And his soul within him mourneth.</p>
