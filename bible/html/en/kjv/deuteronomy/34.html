<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that [is] over against Jericho. And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the LORD said unto him, This [is] the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see [it] with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="11">In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.</p>
