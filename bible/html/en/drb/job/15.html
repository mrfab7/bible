<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Eliphaz the Themanite, answered, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Will a wise man answer as if he were speaking in the wind, and fill his stomach with burning heat?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thou reprovest him by words, who is not equal to thee, and thou speakest that which is not good for thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">As much as is in thee, thou hast made void fear, and hast taken away prayers from before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For thy iniquity hath taught thy mouth, and thou imitatest the tongue of blasphemers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thy own mouth shall condemn thee, and not I: and thy own lips shall answer thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Art thou the first man that was born, or wast thou made before the hills ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Hast thou heard Godâ€™s counsel, and shall his wisdom be inferior to thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What knowest thou that we are ignorant of? what dost thou understand that we know not?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">There are with us also aged and ancient men, much elder than thy fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Is it a great matter that God should comfort thee? but thy wicked words hinder this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Why doth thy heart elevate thee, and why dost thou stare with thy eyes, as if they were thinking great things ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Why doth thy spirit swell against God, to utter such words out of thy mouth ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What is man that he should be without spot, and he that is born of a woman that he should appear just?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold among his saints none is unchangeable, and the heavens are not pure in his sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">How much more is man abominable, and unprofitable, who drinketh iniquity like water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I will shew thee, hear me : and I mill tell thee what I have seen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Wise men confess and hide not their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">To whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger hath passed among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The wicked man is proud all his days, and the number of the years of his tyranny is uncertain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The sound of dread is always in his ears: and when there is peace, he always suspecteth treason.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He believeth not that he may return from darkness to light, looking round about for the sword on every side.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">When he moveth himself to seek bread, he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Tribulation shall terrify him, and distress shall surround him, as a king that is prepared for the battle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For he hath stretched out his hand against God, and hath strengthened himself against the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He hath run against him with his neck raised up, and is armed with a fat neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Fatness hath covered his face, and the fat hangeth down on his sides.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He hath dwelt in desolate cities, and in desert houses that are reduced into heaps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He shall not be enriched, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he push his root in the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He shall not depart out of darkness: the flame shall dry up his branches, and he shall be taken away by the breath of his own month.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">He shall not believe, being vainly deceived by error, that he may be redeemed with any price.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Before his days be full he shall perish: and his hands shall wither away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">He shall be blasted as a vine when its grapes are in the first flower, and as an olive tree that casteth its flower.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For the congregation of the hypocrite is barren, and fire shall devour their tabernacles, who love to take bribes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">He hath conceived sorrow, and hath brought forth iniquity, and his womb prepareth deceits.</p>
