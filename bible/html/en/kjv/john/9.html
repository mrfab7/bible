<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And as [Jesus] passed by, he saw a man which was blind from [his] birth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Some said, This is he: others [said], He is like him: [but] he said, I am [he].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">These [words] spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner [or no], I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear [it] again? will ye also be his disciples?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Mosesâ€™ disciples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">We know that God spake unto Moses: [as for] this [fellow], we know not from whence he is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and [yet] he hath opened mine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And [some] of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</p>
