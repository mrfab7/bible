<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="16" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Of man are arrangements of the heart, And from Jehovah an answer of the tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, And Jehovah is pondering the spirits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Roll unto Jehovah thy works, And established are thy purposes,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">All things hath Jehovah wrought for Himself, And also the wicked worketh for a day of evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">An abomination to Jehovah is every proud one of heart, Hand to hand he is not acquitted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In kindness and truth pardoned is iniquity, And in the fear of Jehovah Turn thou aside from evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When a man’s ways please Jehovah, even his enemies, He causeth to be at peace with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Better is a little with righteousness, Than abundance of increase without justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The heart of man deviseth his way, And Jehovah establisheth his step.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">An oath is on the lips of a king, In judgment his mouth trespasseth not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">A just beam and balances are Jehovah’s, His work are all the stones of the bag.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">An abomination to kings is doing wickedness, For by righteousness is a throne established.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The delight of kings are righteous lips, And whoso is speaking uprightly he loveth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The fury of a king is messengers of death, And a wise man pacifieth it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">In the light of a king’s face is life, And his good-will is as a cloud of the latter rain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">To get wisdom—how much better than gold, And to get understanding to be chosen than silver!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A highway of the upright is, ‘Turn from evil,’ Whoso is preserving his soul is watching his way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Before destruction is pride, And before stumbling—a haughty spirit.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Better is humility of spirit with the poor, Than to apportion spoil with the proud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The wise in any matter findeth good, And whoso is trusting in Jehovah, O his happiness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">To the wise in heart is called, ‘Intelligent,’ And sweetness of lips increaseth learning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A fountain of life is understanding to its possessors, The instruction of fools is folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The heart of the wise causeth his mouth to act wisely, And by his lips he increaseth learning,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Sayings of pleasantness are a honeycomb, Sweet to the soul, and healing to the bone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">There is a way right before a man, And its latter end—ways of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">A labouring man hath laboured for himself, For his mouth hath caused him to bend over it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">A worthless man is preparing evil, And on his lips—as a burning fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A froward man sendeth forth contention, A tale-bearer is separating a familiar friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">A violent man enticeth his neighbour, And hath causeth him to go in a way not good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Consulting his eyes to devise froward things, Moving his lips he hath accomplished evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">A crown of beauty are grey hairs, In the way of righteousness it is found.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Better is the slow to anger than the mighty, And the ruler over his spirit than he who is taking a city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Into the centre is the lot cast, And from Jehovah is all its judgment!</p>
