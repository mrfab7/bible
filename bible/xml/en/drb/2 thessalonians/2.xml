  <verse number="1">And we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of our gathering together unto him:</verse>
  <verse number="2">That you be not easily moved from your sense, nor be terrified, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by epistle, as sent from us, as if the day of the Lord were at hand.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Let no man deceive you by any means, for unless there come a revolt first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who opposeth, and is lifted up above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself as if he were God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Remember you not, that when I was yet with you, I told you these things?</verse>
  <verse number="6">And now you know what withholdeth, that he may be revealed in his time.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For the mystery of iniquity already worketh; only that he who now holdeth, do hold, until he be taken out of the way.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And then that wicked one shall be revealed whom the Lord Jesus shall kill with the spirit of his mouth; and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming, him,</verse>
  <verse number="9">Whose coming is according to the working of Satan, in all power, and signs, and lying wonders,</verse>
  <verse number="10">And in all seduction of iniquity to them that perish; because they receive not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Therefore God shall send them the operation of error, to believe lying:</verse>
  <verse number="12">That all may be judged who have not believed the truth, but have consented to iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren, beloved of God, for that God hath chosen you firstfruits unto salvation, in sanctification of the spirit, and faith of the truth:</verse>
  <verse number="14">Whereunto also he hath called you by our gospel, unto the purchasing of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Therefore, brethren, stand fast; and hold the traditions which you have learned, whether by word, or by our epistle.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God and our Father, who hathloved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation, and good hope in grace,</verse>
  <verse number="17">Exhort your hearts, and confirm you in every good work and word.</verse>
