<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then came all the tribes of Israel to David to Hebron, and spoke, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Even aforetime, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel; and Jehovah said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be prince over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a covenant with them in Hebron before Jehovah; and they anointed David king over Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">David was thirty years old when he began to reign; he reigned forty years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land; and they spoke to David, saying, Thou shalt not come in hither, but the blind and the lame will drive thee back; as much as to say, David will not come in hither.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But David took the stronghold of Zion, which is the city of David.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And David said on that day, Whoever smites the Jebusites and gets up to the watercourse, and the lame and the blind hated of Davidâ€™s soul...! Therefore they say, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">So David dwelt in the stronghold, and called it the city of David. And David built round about from the Millo and inward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And David became continually greater; and Jehovah the God of hosts was with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, and carpenters, and masons; and they built David a house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And David perceived that Jehovah had established him king over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom because of his people Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he had come from Hebron; and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And these are the names of those that were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">and Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, and all the Philistines went up to seek David; and David heard [of it], and went down to the stronghold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And David inquired of Jehovah, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? wilt thou give them into my hand? And Jehovah said to David, Go up; for I will certainly give the Philistines into thy hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And David came to Baal-perazim, and David smote them there; and he said, Jehovah has broken in upon mine enemies before me, as the breaking forth of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place Baal-perazim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And they left their images there, and David and his men took them away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And David inquired of Jehovah; and he said, Thou shalt not go up; turn round behind them and come upon them opposite the mulberry-trees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And it shall be, when thou hearest a sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry-trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself; for then will Jehovah have gone forth before thee, to smite the army of the Philistines.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And David did so, as Jehovah had commanded him; and smote the Philistines from Geba until thou comest to Gezer.</p>
