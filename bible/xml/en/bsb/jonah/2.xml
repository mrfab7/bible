  <verse number="1">From inside the fish, Jonah prayed to the LORD his God,</verse>
  <verse number="2">saying: “In my distress I called to the LORD, and He answered me. From the belly of Sheol I called for help, and You heard my voice.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For You cast me into the deep, into the heart of the seas, and the current swirled about me; all Your breakers and waves swept over me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">At this, I said, ‘I have been banished from Your sight; yet I will look once more toward Your holy temple.’</verse>
  <verse number="5">The waters engulfed me to take my life; the watery depths closed around me; the seaweed wrapped around my head.</verse>
  <verse number="6">To the roots of the mountains I descended; the earth beneath me barred me in forever! But You raised my life from the pit, O LORD my God!</verse>
  <verse number="7">As my life was fading away, I remembered the LORD. My prayer went up to You, to Your holy temple.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Those who cling to worthless idols forsake His loving devotion.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But I, with the voice of thanksgiving, will sacrifice to You. I will fulfill what I have vowed. Salvation is from the LORD!”</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the LORD commanded the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.</verse>
