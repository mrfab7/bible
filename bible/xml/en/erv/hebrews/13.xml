<chapter book="Hebrews" number="13" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Let love of the brethren continue.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Forget not to shew love unto strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; them that are evil entreated, as being yourselves also in the body.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Let marriage be had in honour among all, and let the bed be undefiled: for fornicators and adulterers God will judge.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Be ye free from the love of money; content with such things as ye have: for himself hath said, I will in no wise fail thee, neither will I in any wise forsake thee.</verse>
  <verse number="6">So that with good courage we say, The Lord is my helper; I will not fear: What shall man do unto me?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Remember them that had the rule over you, which spake unto you the word of God; and considering the issue of their life, imitate their faith.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today, yea and for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Be not carried away by divers and strange teachings: for it is good that the heart be stablished by grace; not by meats, wherein they that occupied themselves were not profited.</verse>
  <verse number="10">We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the holy place by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned without the camp.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people through his own blood, suffered without the gate.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Let us therefore go forth unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For we have not here an abiding city, but we seek after the city which is to come.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Through him then let us offer up a sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of lips which make confession to his name.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit to them: for they watch in behalf of your souls, as they that shall give account; that they may do this with joy, and not with grief: for this were unprofitable for you.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Pray for us: for we are persuaded that we have a good conscience, desiring to live honestly in all things.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And I exhort you the more exceedingly to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Now the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep with the blood of the eternal covenant, even our Lord Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="21">make you perfect in every good thing to do his will, working in us that which is well-pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But I exhort you, brethren, bear with the word of exhortation: for I have written unto you in few words.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Know ye that our brother Timothy hath been set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Grace be with you all. Amen.</verse>
