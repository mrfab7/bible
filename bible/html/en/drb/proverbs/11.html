<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A deceitful balance is an abomination before the Lord: and a just weight is his will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Where pride is, there also shall be reproach: but where humility is, there also is wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The simplicity of the just shall guide them: and the deceitfulness of the wicked shall destroy them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Riches shall not profit in the day of revenge: but justice shall deliver from death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The justice of the upright shall make his way prosperous: and the wicked man shall fall by his own wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The justice of the righteous shall deliver them: and the unjust shall be caught in their own snares.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When the wicked man is dead, there shall be no hope any more: and the expectation of the solicitous shall perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The just is delivered out of distress: and the wicked shall be given up for him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The dissembler with his mouth deceiveth his friend: but the just shall be delivered by knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">When it goeth well with the just the city shall rejoice: and when the wicked perish there shall be praise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">By the blessing of the just the city shall be exalted: and by the mouth of the wicked it shall be overthrown.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He that despiseth his friend, is mean of heart: but the wise man will hold his peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He that walketh deceitfully, revealeth secrets: but he that is faithful, concealeth the thing committed to him by his friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Where there is no governor, the people shall fall: but there is safety where there is much counsel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He shall be afflicted with evil, that is surety for a stranger: but he that is aware of the snares, shall be secure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A gracious woman shall find glory: and the strong shall have riches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A merciful man doth good to his own soul: but he that is cruel casteth off even his own kindred.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The wicked maketh an unsteady work: but to him that soweth justice, there is a faithful reward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Clemency prepareth life: and the pursuing of evil things, death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A perverse heart is abominable to the Lord: and his will is in them that walk sincerely.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Hand in hand the evil man shall not be innocent: but the seed of the just shall be saved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A golden ring in a swineâ€™s snout, a woman fair and foolish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The desire of the just is all good: the expectation of the wicked is indignation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Some distribute their own goods, and grow richer: others take away what is not their own, and are always in want.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The soul which blesseth, shall be made fat: and he that inebriateth, shall be inebriated also himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He that hideth up corn, shall be cursed among the people: but a blessing upon the head of them that sell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Well doth he rise early who seeketh good things; but he that seeketh after evil things shall be oppressed by them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the just shall spring up as a green leaf.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He that troubleth his own house, shall inherit the winds: and the fool shall serve the wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The fruit of the just man is a tree of life: and he that gaineth souls, is wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">If the just man receive in the earth, how much more the wicked and the sinner.</p>
