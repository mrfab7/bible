  <verse number="1">And I say, for as long time as the heir is a child, he differs nothing from a servant, being lord of all;</verse>
  <verse number="2">But is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father.</verse>
  <verse number="3">So also we, when we were children, were subjugated under the world’s elements:</verse>
  <verse number="4">And when the completion of the time was come, God sent his Son, born of woman, born under the law,</verse>
  <verse number="5">That he might redeem them under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</verse>
  <verse number="7">So that thou art no more a servant, but a son: and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But then truly, not having known God, ye were in a servile condition to them not being gods by nature.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And now, having known God, and rather known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and poor elements, to which again ye wish anew to be in a servile condition.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Ye observe narrowly days, and months, and times, and years.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I am afraid of you, lest I have been wearied for you in vain.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Be ye as I, for I also as you, brethren, I pray you: ye injured me nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And ye know that through weakness of the flesh I announced the good news to you before.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And my temptation in my flesh, ye counted not as nothing, nor spurned; but as an angel of God ye received me, as Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="15">What then was your happiness? for I testify to you, that, if possible, having plucked out your eyes, ye would have given to me.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Have I then been your enemy, speaking truth to you.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They are zealous for you, not well; but they wish to exclude you, that ye might be zealous for them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And good to be zealous always in good, and not only in my being present with you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">My children, for whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you,</verse>
  <verse number="20">And I would be present with you now, and change my voice; for I am perplexed about you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Tell me, those wishing to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</verse>
  <verse number="22">For it has been written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the bondmaid, and one by the free.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But he truly of the bondmaid was born according to the flesh; and he of the free through the promise.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Which things are spoken figuratively: for these are the two covenants; one truly from mount Sinai, begetting to bondage, which is Agar.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and now stands in the same rank With Jerusalem, and is in a servile condition with her children.</verse>
  <verse number="26">But Jerusalem above is free, which is mother of us all.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For it has been written, Be cheered, O barren, bearing not; break out and cry, she travailing not: for many more the children of the desolate than she having a husband.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And we, brethren, as Isaac, are children of promise.</verse>
  <verse number="29">But as then he born according to the flesh drove out him according to the Spirit, so also now.</verse>
  <verse number="30">But what says the writing? Cast out the bondmaid and her son; for the son of the bondmaid shall not inherit with the son of the free.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Therefore, brethren, we are not children of the bondmaid, but of the free.</verse>
