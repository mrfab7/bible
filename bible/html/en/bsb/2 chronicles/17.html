<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Asa’s son Jehoshaphat reigned in his place, and he strengthened himself against Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">He stationed troops in every fortified city of Judah and put garrisons in the land of Judah and in the cities of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Now the LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he walked in the earlier ways of his father David. He did not seek the Baals,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">but he sought the God of his father and walked by His commandments rather than the practices of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">So the LORD established the kingdom in his hand, and all Judah brought him tribute, so that he had an abundance of riches and honor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And his heart took delight in the ways of the LORD; furthermore, he removed the high places and Asherah poles from Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In the third year of his reign, Jehoshaphat sent his officials Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach in the cities of Judah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">accompanied by certain Levites—Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah—along with the priests Elishama and Jehoram.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They taught throughout Judah, taking with them the Book of the Law of the LORD. They went throughout the towns of Judah and taught the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the dread of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that surrounded Judah, so that they did not make war against Jehoshaphat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Some Philistines also brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat, and the Arabs brought him 7,700 rams and 7,700 goats from their flocks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Jehoshaphat grew stronger and stronger, and he built fortresses and store cities in Judah</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and kept vast supplies in the cities of Judah. He also had warriors in Jerusalem who were mighty men of valor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">These are their numbers according to the houses of their fathers: From Judah, the commanders of thousands: Adnah the commander, and with him 300,000 mighty men of valor;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">next to him, Jehohanan the commander, and with him 280,000;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">and next to him, Amasiah son of Zichri, the volunteer for the LORD, and with him 200,000 mighty men of valor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">From Benjamin: Eliada, a mighty man of valor, and with him 200,000 armed with bows and shields;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">and next to him, Jehozabad, and with him 180,000 armed for battle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">These were the men who served the king, besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout Judah.</p>
