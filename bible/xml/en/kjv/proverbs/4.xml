  <verse number="8">Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.</verse>
  <verse number="9">She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.</verse>

  <verse number="15">Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause [some] to fall.</verse>
