<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Just as with the dividing of the waters, so also is the heart of the king in the hand of the Lord. He shall bend it whichever way he wills.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Every way of a man seems right to himself. But the Lord weighs hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">To do mercy and judgment is more pleasing to the Lord than sacrifices.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To lift up the eyes is to enlarge the heart. The lamp of the impious is sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The intentions of the robust continually bring forth abundance. But all the lazy are continually in need.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Whoever gathers treasures by a lying tongue is vain and heartless. And he will stumble into the snares of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The robberies of the impious will drag them down, because they were not willing to do judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The perverse way of a man is foreign. But whoever is pure: his work is upright.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">It is better to sit in a corner of the attic, than with a contentious woman and in a shared house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The soul of the impious desires evil; he will not take pity on his neighbor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">When the pestilent is punished, a little one will become wiser. And if he pursues what is wise, he will receive knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The just thinks carefully about the house of the impious, so that he may draw the impious away from evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whoever blocks his ears to the outcry of the poor shall also cry out himself, and he will not be heeded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">A surprise gift extinguishes anger. And a gift concealed in the bosom extinguishes the greatest indignation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">It is gladness for the just to do judgment; and it is dread for those who work iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A man who wanders astray from the way of doctrine will linger in the company of the giants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Whoever loves a feast will be in deprivation. Whoever loves wine and fatness will not be enriched.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The impious is given over instead of the just, and the iniquitous is given over in place of the upright.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">It is better to live in a deserted land, than with a quarrelsome and emotional woman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">There is desirable treasure, as well as oil, in the habitations of the just. And the imprudent man will waste it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Whoever follows justice and mercy shall discover life, justice, and glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The wise has ascended the city of the strong, and he has torn down the bulwark of its confidence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue guards his soul from anguish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">A proud and arrogant one is also called ignorant, if he, in anger, acts according to pride.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Desires kill the lazy, for his hands are not willing to work at all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He covets and desires all day long. But whoever is just shall distribute and shall not cease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The sacrifices of the impious are abominable, because they are offered out of wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A lying witness will perish. An obedient man shall speak of victory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">The impious man insolently hardens his face. But whoever is upright corrects his own way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">There is no wisdom, there is no prudence, there is no counsel, which is against the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The horse is prepared for the day of battle. But the Lord bestows salvation.</p>
