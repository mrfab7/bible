<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="12" data-translation="Darby Bible Translation" data-translation-id="dbt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But concerning spiritual [manifestations], brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Ye know that when ye were [of the] nations [ye were] led away to dumb idols, in whatever way ye might be led.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I give you therefore to know, that no one, speaking in [the power of the] Spirit of God, says, Curse [on] Jesus; and no one can say, Lord Jesus, unless in [the power of the] Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But there are distinctions of gifts, but the same Spirit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and there are distinctions of services, and the same Lord;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and there are distinctions of operations, but the same God who operates all things in all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But to each the manifestation of the Spirit is given for profit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For to one, by the Spirit, is given [the] word of wisdom; and to another [the] word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and to a different one faith, in [the power of] the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healing in [the power of] the same Spirit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and to another operations of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; and to a different one kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of tongues.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But all these things operates the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each in particular according as he pleases.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For even as the body is one and has many members, but all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also [is] the Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For also in [the power of] one Spirit we have all been baptised into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bondmen or free, and have all been given to drink of one Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For also the body is not one member but many.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If the foot say, Because I am not a hand I am not of the body, is it on account of this not indeed of the body?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And if the ear say, Because I am not an eye I am not of the body, is it on account of this not indeed of the body?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If the whole body [were] an eye, where the hearing? if all hearing, where the smelling?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But now God has set the members, each one of them in the body, according as it has pleased [him].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But if all were one member, where the body?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But now the members [are] many, and the body one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The eye cannot say to the hand, I have not need of thee; or again, the head to the feet, I have not need of you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But much rather, the members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">and those [parts] of the body which we esteem to be the more void of honour, these we clothe with more abundant honour; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">but our comely [parts] have not need. But God has tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to [the part] that lacked;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">that there might be no division in the body, but that the members might have the same concern one for another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And if one member suffer, all the members suffer with [it]; and if one member be glorified, all the members rejoice with [it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Now ye are Christâ€™s body, and members in particular.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And God has set certain in the assembly: first, apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; then miraculous powers; then gifts of healings; helps; governments; kinds of tongues.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">[Are] all apostles? [are] all prophets? [are] all teachers? [are] all [in possession of] miraculous powers?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But desire earnestly the greater gifts, and yet shew I unto you a way of more surpassing excellence.</p>
