<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="14" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">FOLLOW after charity, be zealous for spiritual gifts; but rather that you may prophesy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For he that speaketh in a tongue, speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man heareth. Yet by the Spirit he speaketh mysteries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But he that prophesieth, speaketh to men unto edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He that speaketh in a tongue, edifieth himself: but he that prophesieth, edifieth the church.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And I would have you all to speak with tongues, but rather to prophesy. For greater is he that prophesieth, than he that speaketh with tongues: unless perhaps he interpret, that the church may receive edification.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either in revelation, or in knowledge, or in prophecy, or in doctrine?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Even things without life that give sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction of sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">So likewise you, except you utter by the tongue plain speech, how shall it be known what is said ? For you shall be speaking into the air.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">There are, for example, so many kinds of tongues in this world; and none is without voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If then I know not the power of the voice, I shall be to him to whom I speak a barbarian; and he that speaketh, a barbarian to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">So you also, forasmuch as you are zealous of spirits, seek to abound unto the edifying of the church.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And therefore he that speaketh by a tongue, let him pray that he may interpret.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is without fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">What is it then ? I will pray with the spirit, I will pray also with the understanding; I will sing with the spirit, I will sing also with the understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Else if thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that holdeth the place of the unlearned say, Amen, to thy blessing ? because he knoweth not what thou sayest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For thou indeed givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I thank my God I speak with all your tongues.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may instruct others also; than ten thousand words in a tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Brethren, do not become children in sense: but in malice be children, and in sense be perfect.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">In the law it is written: In other tongues and other lips I will speak to this people; and neither so will they hear me, saith the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers; but prophecies not to unbelievers, but to believers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If therefore the whole church come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in unlearned persons or infidels, will they not say that you are mad ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or an unlearned person, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so, falling down on his face, he will adore God, affirming that God is among you indeed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">How is it then, brethren ? When you come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation: let all things be done to edification.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">If any speak with a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and in course, and let one interpret.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">But if there be no interpreter, let him hold his peace in the church, and speak to himself and to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And let the prophets speak, two or three; and let the rest judge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">But if any thing be revealed to another sitting, let the first hold his peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For you may all prophesy one by one; that all may learn, and all may be exhorted:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">For God is not the God of dissension, but of peace: as also I teach in all the churches of the saints.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Let women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted them to speak, but to be subject, as also the law saith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">But if they would learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Or did the word of God come out from you ? Or came it only unto you ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">If any seem to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him know the things that I write to you, that they are the commandments of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">But if any man know not, he shall not be known.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Wherefore, brethren, be zealous to prophesy; and forbid not to speak with tongues.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">But let all things be done decently, and according to order.</p>
