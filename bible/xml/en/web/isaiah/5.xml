<chapter book="Isaiah" number="5" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Let me sing for my well beloved a song of my beloved about his vineyard. My beloved had a vineyard on a very fruitful hill.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He dug it up, gathered out its stones, planted it with the choicest vine, built a tower in its midst, and also cut out a winepress therein. He looked for it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes.</verse>
  <verse number="3">“Now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, please judge between me and my vineyard.</verse>
  <verse number="4">What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? Why, when I looked for it to yield grapes, did it yield wild grapes?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. I will take away its hedge, and it will be eaten up. I will break down its wall of it, and it will be trampled down.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I will lay it a wasteland. It won’t be pruned nor hoed, but it will grow briers and thorns. I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain on it.”</verse>
  <verse number="7">For the vineyard of Yahweh of Armies is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression; for righteousness, but, behold, a cry of distress.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Woe to those who join house to house, who lay field to field, until there is no room, and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!</verse>
  <verse number="9">In my ears, Yahweh of Armies says: “Surely many houses will be desolate, even great and beautiful, unoccupied.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield an ephah.”</verse>
  <verse number="11">Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; who stay late into the night, until wine inflames them!</verse>
  <verse number="12">The harp, lyre, tambourine, and flute, with wine, are at their feasts; but they don’t respect the work of Yahweh, neither have they considered the operation of his hands.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Therefore my people go into captivity for lack of knowledge. Their honorable men are famished, and their multitudes are parched with thirst.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Therefore Sheol has enlarged its desire, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory, their multitude, their pomp, and he who rejoices among them, descend into it.</verse>
  <verse number="15">So man is brought low, mankind is humbled, and the eyes of the arrogant ones are humbled;</verse>
  <verse number="16">but Yahweh of Armies is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Then the lambs will graze as in their pasture, and strangers will eat the ruins of the rich.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, and wickedness as with cart rope;</verse>
  <verse number="19">Who say, “Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it!”</verse>
  <verse number="20">Woe to those who call evil good, and good evil; who put darkness for light, and light for darkness; who put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!</verse>
  <verse number="21">Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!</verse>
  <verse number="22">Woe to those who are mighty to drink wine, and champions at mixing strong drink;</verse>
  <verse number="23">who acquit the guilty for a bribe, but deny justice for the innocent!</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust; because they have rejected the law of Yahweh of Armies, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Therefore Yahweh’s anger burns against his people, and he has stretched out his hand against them, and has struck them. The mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this, his anger is not turned away, but his hand is still stretched out.</verse>
  <verse number="26">He will lift up a banner to the nations from far, and he will whistle for them from the end of the earth. Behold, they will come speedily and swiftly.</verse>
  <verse number="27">None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the belt of their waist be untied, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:</verse>
  <verse number="28">whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent. Their horses’ hoofs will be like flint, and their wheels like a whirlwind.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Their roaring will be like a lioness. They will roar like young lions. Yes, they shall roar, and seize their prey and carry it off, and there will be no one to deliver.</verse>
  <verse number="30">They will roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea. If one looks to the land behold, darkness and distress. The light is darkened in its clouds.</verse>
