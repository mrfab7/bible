<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Timothy" data-chapter="1" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Saviour, and Christ Jesus our hope;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">unto Timothy, my true child in faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">As I exhorted thee to tarry at Ephesus, when I was going into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge certain men not to teach a different doctrine,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">neither to give heed to fables and endless genealogies, the which minister questionings, rather than a dispensation of God which is in faith; so do I now.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But the end of the charge is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith unfeigned:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">from which things some having swerved have turned aside unto vain talking;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">desiring to be teachers of the law, though they understand neither what they say, nor whereof they confidently affirm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">as knowing this, that law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and unruly, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">for fornicators, for abusers of themselves with men, for menstealers, for liars, for false swearers, and if there be any other thing contrary to the sound doctrine;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I thank him that enabled me, even Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he counted me faithful, appointing me to his service;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">though I was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: howbeit I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and the grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Faithful is the saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me as chief might Jesus Christ shew forth all his longsuffering, for an ensample of them which should hereafter believe on him unto eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Now unto the King eternal, incorruptible, invisible, the only God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">This charge I commit unto thee, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that by them thou mayest war the good warfare;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">holding faith and a good conscience; which some having thrust from them made shipwreck concerning the faith:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I delivered unto Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.</p>
