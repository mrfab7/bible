<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="6" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbor, If thou hast stricken thy hands for a stranger;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, Thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, Seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbor: Go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbor;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Give not sleep to thine eyes, Nor slumber to thine eyelids;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, And as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Go to the ant, thou sluggard; Consider her ways, and be wise:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Which having no chief, Overseer, or ruler,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Provideth her bread in the summer, And gathereth her food in the harvest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">So shall thy poverty come as a robber, And thy want as an armed man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A worthless person, a man of iniquity, Is he that walketh with a perverse mouth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">That winketh with his eyes, that speaketh with his feet, That maketh signs with his fingers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">In whose heart is perverseness, Who deviseth evil continually, Who soweth discord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; On a sudden shall he be broken, and that without remedy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">There are six things which Jehovah hateth; Yea, seven which are an abomination unto him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, And hands that shed innocent blood;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">A heart that deviseth wicked purposes, Feet that are swift in running to mischief,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A false witness that uttereth lies, And he that soweth discord among brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My son, keep the commandment of thy father, And forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Bind them continually upon thy heart; Tie them about thy neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">When thou walkest, it shall lead thee; When thou sleepest, it shall watch over thee; And when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; And reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">To keep thee from the evil woman, From the flattery of the foreigner’s tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Lust not after her beauty in thy heart; Neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For on account of a harlot a man is brought to a piece of bread; And the adulteress hunteth for the precious life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Can a man take fire in his bosom, And his clothes not be burned?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Or can one walk upon hot coals, And his feet not be scorched?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">So he that goeth in to his neighbor’s wife; Whosoever toucheth her shall not be unpunished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Men do not despise a thief, if he steal To satisfy himself when he is hungry:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; He shall give all the substance of his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He that committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding: He doeth it who would destroy his own soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Wounds and dishonor shall he get; And his reproach shall not be wiped away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For jealousy is the rage of a man; And he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">He will not regard any ransom; Neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</p>
