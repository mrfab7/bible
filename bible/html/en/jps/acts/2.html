<p class="verse" data-verse="1">At length, on the day of the Harvest Festival, they had all met in one place;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">when suddenly there came from the sky a sound as of a strong rushing blast of wind. This filled the whole house where they were sitting;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and they saw tongues of what looked like fire distributing themselves over the assembly, and on the head of each person a tongue alighted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in foreign languages according as the Spirit gave them words to utter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Now there were Jews residing in Jerusalem, devout men from every part of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">So when this noise was heard, they came crowding together, and were amazed because everyone heard his own language spoken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They were beside themselves with wonder, and exclaimed, “Are not all these speakers Galilaeans?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">How then does each of us hear his own native language spoken by them?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Some of us are Parthians, Medes, Elamites. Some are inhabitants of Mesopotamia, of Judaea or Cappadocia, of Pontus or the Asian Province, of Phrygia or Pamphylia,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">of Egypt or of the parts of Africa towards Cyrene. Others are visitors from Rome—being either Jews or converts from heathenism—and others are Cretans or Arabians.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Yet we all alike hear these Galilaeans speaking in our own language about the wonderful things which God has done.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They were all astounded and bewildered, and asked one another, “What can this mean?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But others, scornfully jeering, said, “They are brim-full of sweet wine.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Peter however, together with the Eleven, stood up and addressed them in a loud voice. “Men of Judaea, and all you inhabitants of Jerusalem,” he said, “be in no uncertainty about this matter but pay attention to what I say.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For this is not intoxication, as you suppose, it being only the third hour of the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But that which was predicted through the Prophet Joel has happened:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">“And it shall come to pass in the last days, God says, that I will pour out My Spirit upon all mankind; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall have dreams;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">and even upon My bondservants, both men and women, at that time, I will pour out My Spirit, and they shall prophesy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I will display marvels in the sky above, and signs on the earth below, blood and fire, and pillars of smoke.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, to usher in the day of the Lord—that great and illustrious day;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">and every one who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">“Listen, Israelites, to what I say. Jesus, the Nazarene, a man accredited to you from God by miracles and marvels and signs which God did among you through Him, as you yourselves know, Him—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">delivered up through God’s settled purpose and foreknowledge—you by the hands of Gentiles have nailed to a cross and have put to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But God has raised Him to life, having terminated the throes of death, for in fact it was not possible for Him to be held fast by death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For David says in reference to Him, “’I constantly fixed my eyes upon the Lord, because He is at my right hand in order that I may continue unshaken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For this reason my heart is glad and my tongue exults. My body also shall rest in hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For Thou wilt not leave me in the Unseen World forsaken, nor give up Thy holy One to undergo decay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Thou hast made known to me the ways of Life: Thou wilt fill me with gladness in Thy presence.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">“As to the patriarch David, I need hardly remind you, brethren, that he died and was buried, and that we still have his tomb among us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Being a Prophet, however, and knowing that God had solemnly sworn to him to seat a descendant of his upon his throne,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">with prophetic foresight he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, to the effect that He was not left forsaken in the Unseen World, nor did His body undergo decay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">This Jesus, God has raised to life—a fact to which all of us testify.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">“Being therefore lifted high by the mighty hand of God, He has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out this which you see and hear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For David did not ascend into Heaven, but he says himself, “’The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">until I make thy foes a footstool under thy feet.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">“Therefore let the whole House of Israel know beyond all doubt that God has made Him both LORD and CHRIST—this Jesus whom you crucified.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Stung to the heart by these words, they said to Peter and the rest of the Apostles, “Brethren, what are we to do?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">“Repent,” replied Peter, “and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, with a view to the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">For to you belongs the promise, and to your children, and to all who are far off, whoever the Lord our God may call.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And with many more appeals he solemnly warned and entreated them, saying, “Escape from this crooked generation.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Those, therefore, who joyfully welcomed his Message were baptized; and on that one day about three thousand persons were added to them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">and they were constant in listening to the teaching of the Apostles and in their attendance at the Communion, that is, the Breaking of the Bread, and at prayer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">Fear came upon every one, and many marvels and signs were done by the Apostles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And all the believers kept together, and had everything in common.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">They sold their lands and other property, and distributed the proceeds among all, according to every one’s necessities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">And, day by day, attending constantly in the Temple with one accord, and breaking bread in private houses, they took their meals with great happiness and single-heartedness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">praising God and being regarded with favour by all the people. Also, day by day, the Lord added to their number those whom He was saving.</p>
