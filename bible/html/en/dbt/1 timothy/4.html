<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But the Spirit speaks expressly, that in latter times some shall apostatise from the faith, giving their mind to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">speaking lies in hypocrisy, cauterised as to their own conscience,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">forbidding to marry, [bidding] to abstain from meats, which God has created for receiving with thanksgiving for them who are faithful and know the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For every creature of God [is] good, and nothing [is] to be rejected, being received with thanksgiving;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">for it is sanctified by God’s word and freely addressing [him].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Laying these things before the brethren, thou wilt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which thou hast fully followed up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But profane and old wives’ fables avoid, but exercise thyself unto piety;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">for bodily exercise is profitable for a little, but piety is profitable for everything, having promise of life, of the present one, and of that to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The word [is] faithful and worthy of all acceptation;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">for, for this we labour and suffer reproach, because we hope in a living God, who is preserver of all men, specially of those that believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Enjoin and teach these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let no one despise thy youth, but be a model of the believers, in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Till I come, give thyself to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Be not negligent of the gift [that is] in thee, which has been given to thee through prophecy, with imposition of the hands of the elderhood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Occupy thyself with these things; be wholly in them, that thy progress may be manifest to all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Give heed to thyself and to the teaching; continue in them; for, doing this, thou shalt save both thyself and those that hear thee.</p>
