<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Rejoice not, O Israel, unto exultation, like the peoples, For thou hast gone astray from thy God, Thou hast loved a harlot’s hire upon every corn-floor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The threshing-floor and the wine-press shall not feed them, And the new wine shall fail her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They shall not dwell in the LORD’S land; But Ephraim shall return to Egypt, And they shall eat unclean food in Assyria.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They shall not pour out wine-offerings to the LORD, Neither shall they be pleasing unto Him; Their sacrifices shall be unto them as the bread of mourners, All that eat thereof shall be polluted; For their bread shall be for their appetite, It shall not come into the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">What will ye do in the day of the appointed season, And in the day of the feast of the LORD?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For, lo, they are gone away from destruction, Yet Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them; Their precious treasures of silver, nettles shall possess them, Thorns shall be in their tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The days of visitation are come, The days of recompense are come, Israel shall know it. The prophet is a fool, the man of the spirit is mad! For the multitude of thine iniquity, the enmity is great.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Ephraim is a watchman with my God; As for the prophet, a fowler’s snare is in all his ways, And enmity in the house of his God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They have deeply corrupted themselves, As in the days of Gibeah; He will remember their iniquity, He will punish their sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness, I saw your fathers as the first-ripe in the fig-tree at her first season; But so soon as they came to Baal-peor, They separated themselves unto the shameful thing, And became detestable like that which they loved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird; There shall be no birth, and none with child, and no conception.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Yea, though they bring up their children, Yet will I bereave them, that there be not a man left; Yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Ephraim, like as I have seen Tyre, is planted in a pleasant place; But Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the slayer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Give them, O LORD, whatsoever Thou wilt give; Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All their wickedness is in Gilgal, For there I hated them; Because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of My house; I will love them no more, All their princes are rebellious.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Ephraim is smitten, Their root is dried up, They shall bear no fruit; Yea, though they bring forth, Yet will I slay the beloved fruit of their womb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">My God will cast them away, Because they did not hearken unto Him; And they shall be wanderers among the nations.</p>
