<chapter book="Hebrews" number="7" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">For this Melchisedec, King of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from smiting the kings, and blessed him;</verse>
  <verse number="2">to whom Abraham gave also the tenth portion of all; first being interpreted King of righteousness, and then also King of Salem, which is King of peace;</verse>
  <verse number="3">without father, without mother, without genealogy; having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but assimilated to the Son of God, abides a priest continually.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Now consider how great this [personage] was, to whom [even] the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth out of the spoils.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And they indeed from among the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have commandment to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is from their brethren, though these are come out of the loins of Abraham:</verse>
  <verse number="6">but he who has no genealogy from them has tithed Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But beyond all gainsaying, the inferior is blessed by the better.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And here dying men receive tithes; but there [one] of whom the witness is that he lives;</verse>
  <verse number="9">and, so to speak, through Abraham, Levi also, who received tithes, has been made to pay tithes.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If indeed then perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, for the people had their law given to them in connexion with it, what need [was there] still that a different priest should arise according to the order of Melchisedec, and not be named after the order of Aaron?</verse>
  <verse number="12">For, the priesthood being changed, there takes place of necessity a change of law also.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For he, of whom these things are said, belongs to a different tribe, of which no one has [ever] been attached to the service of the altar.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For it is clear that our Lord has sprung out of Juda, as to which tribe Moses spake nothing as to priests.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And it is yet more abundantly evident, since a different priest arises according to the similitude of Melchisedec,</verse>
  <verse number="16">who has been constituted not according to law of fleshly commandment, but according to power of indissoluble life.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For it is borne witness, Thou art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For there is a setting aside of the commandment going before for its weakness and unprofitableness,</verse>
  <verse number="19">(for the law perfected nothing,) and the introduction of a better hope by which we draw nigh to God.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And by how much [it was] not without the swearing of an oath;</verse>
  <verse number="21">(for they are become priests without the swearing of an oath, but he with the swearing of an oath, by him who said, as to him, The Lord has sworn, and will not repent [of it], Thou [art] priest for ever [according to the order of Melchisedec];)</verse>
  <verse number="22">by so much Jesus became surety of a better covenant.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they have been many priests, on account of being hindered from continuing by death;</verse>
  <verse number="24">but he, because of his continuing for ever, has the priesthood unchangeable.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Whence also he is able to save completely those who approach by him to God, always living to intercede for them.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For such a high priest became us, holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and become higher than the heavens:</verse>
  <verse number="27">who has not day by day need, as the high priests, first to offer up sacrifices for his own sins, then [for] those of the people; for this he did once for all [in] having offered up himself.</verse>
  <verse number="28">For the law constitutes men high priests, having infirmity; but the word of the swearing of the oath which [is] after the law, a Son perfected for ever.</verse>
