<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellence; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Hearken to this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</p>
