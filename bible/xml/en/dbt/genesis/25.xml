  <verse number="1">And Abraham took another wife named Keturah.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And she bore him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Jokshan begot Sheba and Dedan; and the sons of Dedan were the Asshurim, and the Letushim, and the Leummim.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the sons of Midian were Ephah, and Epher, and Enoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were sons of Keturah.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And to the sons of the concubines that Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and, while he yet lived, sent them away from Isaac his son, eastward to the east country.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived: a hundred and seventy-five years.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Abraham expired and died in a good old age, old and full [of days]; and was gathered to his peoples.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which was opposite to Mamre—</verse>
  <verse number="10">the field that Abraham had purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac. And Isaac dwelt at Beer-lahai-roi.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s bondwoman, bore to Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael by their names according to their generations: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,</verse>
  <verse number="14">and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,</verse>
  <verse number="15">Hadad and Tema, Jetur, Naphish and Kedmah.</verse>
  <verse number="16">These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, in their hamlets and their encampments—twelve princes of their peoples.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And these are the years of the life of Ishmael: a hundred and thirty-seven years; and he expired and died, and was gathered to his peoples.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And they dwelt from Havilah to Shur, which is opposite to Egypt, as one goes towards Assyria. He settled before the face of all his brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son. Abraham begot Isaac.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebecca as wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-Aram, the sister of Laban the Syrian.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his wife, because she was barren; and Jehovah was entreated of him, and Rebecca his wife conceived.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If [it be] so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Jehovah said to her, Two nations are in thy womb, And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels; And one people shall be stronger than the other people, And the elder shall serve the younger.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the first came out red—all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And after that came his brother out; and his hand took hold of Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when they were born.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And the boys grew, and Esau became a man skilled in hunting, a man of the field; and Jacob was a homely man, dwelling in tents.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Isaac loved Esau, because venison was to his taste; and Rebecca loved Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Jacob had cooked a dish; and Esau came from the field, and he was faint.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with the red—the red thing there, for I am faint. Therefore was his name called Edom.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And Jacob said, Sell me now thy birthright.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And Esau said, Behold, I am going to die, and of what use can the birthright be to me?</verse>
  <verse number="33">And Jacob said, Swear unto me now. And he swore unto him, and sold his birthright to Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Jacob gave Esau bread and the dish of lentils; and he ate and drank, and rose up and went away. Thus Esau despised the birthright.</verse>
