  <verse number="3">An Ammonite and a Moabite shall not come into the gathering of Jehovah; also the tenth generation to them shall not come in to the gathering of Jehovah, even forever:</verse>
  <verse number="4">For the word that they met you not with bread and with water in the way in your coming out of Egypt, and who hired against thee Balaam, son of Beor of Pethor, of Arum of the two rivers, to curse thee.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Jehovah thy God willed not to hear to Balaam: and Jehovah thy God will turn to thee the curse to a blessing, for Jehovah thy God loved thee.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Thou shalt not seek their peace and their good all thy days to forever.</verse>

  <verse number="12">And a hand shall be to thee from without the camp, and thou shalt go forth there without:</verse>
  <verse number="13">And a peg shall be to thee upon thy utensil: and it was in thy sitting down without, and digging with it, and turn thou back and cover thy excrement:</verse>
  <verse number="14">For Jehovah thy God goes in the midst of thy camp to deliver thee, and to give thine enemies before thy face; and thy camp was holy; and he will not see in thee the nakedness of a word and turn back from after thee.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thou shalt not deliver the servant to his lord who shall be delivered to thee from his lord.</verse>

  <verse number="22">And if thou shalt cease to vow, it shall not be sin in thee.</verse>
  <verse number="23">That going out of thy lips, thou shalt watch and do according as thou didst vow to Jehovah thy God; a voluntary gift which thou spakest with thy mouth.</verse>

  <verse number="25">When thou shalt come into thy friend’s standing grain, pluck off the ears with thine hand, and thou shalt not lift up a sickle upon thy friend’s standing grain.</verse>
