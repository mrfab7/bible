<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="2" translation="King James Bible" translationID="kjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is [the joy] of you all.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Sufficient to such a man [is] this punishment, which [was inflicted] of many.</verse>
  <verse number="7">So that contrariwise ye [ought] rather to forgive [him], and comfort [him], lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm [your] love toward him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.</verse>
  <verse number="10">To whom ye forgive any thing, I [forgive] also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave [it], for your sakes [forgave I it] in the person of Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="11">Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Furthermore, when I came to Troas to [preach] Christ’s gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,</verse>
  <verse number="13">I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Now thanks [be] unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</verse>
  <verse number="16">To the one [we are] the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who [is] sufficient for these things?</verse>
  <verse number="17">For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</verse>
