<chapter book="1 Peter" number="2" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Laying aside therefore all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speakings,</verse>
  <verse number="2">as newborn babes desire earnestly the pure mental milk of the word, that by it ye may grow up to salvation,</verse>
  <verse number="3">if indeed ye have tasted that the Lord [is] good.</verse>
  <verse number="4">To whom coming, a living stone, cast away indeed as worthless by men, but with God chosen, precious,</verse>
  <verse number="5">yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Because it is contained in the scripture: Behold, I lay in Zion a corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be put to shame.</verse>
  <verse number="7">To you therefore who believe [is] the preciousness; but to the disobedient, the stone which the builders cast away as worthless, this is become head of [the] corner,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and a stone of stumbling and rock of offence; [who] stumble at the word, being disobedient to which also they have been appointed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But ye [are] a chosen race, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a people for a possession, that ye might set forth the excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness to his wonderful light;</verse>
  <verse number="10">who once [were] not a people, but now God’s people; who were not enjoying mercy, but now have found mercy.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Beloved, I exhort [you], as strangers and sojourners, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</verse>
  <verse number="12">having your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that [as to that] in which they speak against you as evildoers, they may through [your] good works, [themselves] witnessing [them], glorify God in [the] day of visitation.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Be in subjection [therefore] to every human institution for the Lord’s sake; whether to [the] king as supreme,</verse>
  <verse number="14">or to rulers as sent by him, for vengeance on evildoers, and praise to them that do well.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Because so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye put to silence the ignorance of senseless men;</verse>
  <verse number="16">as free, and not as having liberty as a cloak of malice, but as God’s bondmen.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Shew honour to all, love the brotherhood, fear God, honour the king.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Servants, [be] subject with all fear to your masters, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the ill-tempered.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For this [is] acceptable, if one, for conscience sake towards God, endure griefs, suffering unjustly.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For what glory [is it], if sinning and being buffeted ye shall bear [it]? but if, doing good and suffering, ye shall bear [it], this is acceptable with God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For to this have ye been called; for Christ also has suffered for you, leaving you a model that ye should follow in his steps:</verse>
  <verse number="22">who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth;</verse>
  <verse number="23">who, [when] reviled, reviled not again; [when] suffering, threatened not; but gave [himself] over into the hands of him who judges righteously;</verse>
  <verse number="24">who himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, in order that, being dead to sins, we may live to righteousness: by whose stripes ye have been healed.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For ye were going astray as sheep, but have now returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls.</verse>
