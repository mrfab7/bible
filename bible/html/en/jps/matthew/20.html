<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“For the Kingdom of the Heavens is like an employer who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and having made an agreement with them for a shilling a day, sent them into his vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">About nine o’clock he went out and saw others loitering in the market-place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To these also he said, “’You also, go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">“So they went. Again about twelve, and about three o’clock, he went out and did the same.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And going out about five o’clock he found others loitering, and he asked them, “’Why have you been standing here all day long, doing nothing?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">“’Because no one has hired us,’ they replied. “’You also, go into the vineyard,’ he said.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">“When evening came, the master said to his steward, “’Call the men and pay them their wages. Begin with the last set and finish with the first.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">“When those came who had begun at five o’clock, they received a shilling apiece;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and when the first came, they expected to get more, but they also each got the shilling.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">So when they had received it, they grumbled against the employer, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">“’These who came last have done only one hour’s work, and you have put them on a level with us who have worked the whole day and have borne the scorching heat.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">“’My friend,’ he answered to one of them, ‘I am doing you no injustice. Did you not agree with me for a shilling?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Take your money and go. I choose to give this last comer just as much as I give you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Have I not a right to do what I choose with my own property? Or are you envious because I am generous?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">“So the last shall be first, and the first last.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Jesus was now going up to Jerusalem, and He took the twelve disciples aside by themselves, and on the way He said to them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">“We are going up to Jerusalem, and there the Son of Man will be betrayed to the High Priests and Scribes. They will condemn Him to death,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and hand Him over to the Gentiles to be made sport of and scourged and crucified; and on the third day He will be raised to life.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Then the mother of the sons of Zabdi came to Him with her sons, and knelt before Him to make a request of Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">“What is it you desire?” He asked. “Command,” she replied, “that these my two sons may sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your Kingdom.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">“None of you know what you are asking for,” said Jesus; “can you drink out of the cup from which I am about to drink?” “We can,” they replied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">“You shall drink out of my cup,” He said, “but a seat at my right hand or at my left it is not for me to allot, but it belongs to those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The other ten heard of this, and their indignation was aroused against the two brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But Jesus called them to Him, and said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great men exercise authority over them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Not so shall it be among you; but whoever desires to be great among you shall be your servant,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">and whoever desires to be first among you shall be your bondservant;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">just as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give His life as the redemption-price for many.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">As they were leaving Jericho, an immense crowd following Him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">two blind men sitting by the roadside heard that it was Jesus who was passing by, and cried aloud, “Sir, Son of David, pity us.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The people angrily tried to silence them, but they cried all the louder. “O Sir, Son of David, pity us,” they said.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">So Jesus stood still and called to them. “What shall I do for you?” He asked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">“Sir, let our eyes be opened,” they replied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him.</p>
