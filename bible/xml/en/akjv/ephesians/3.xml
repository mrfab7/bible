  <verse number="1">For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,</verse>
  <verse number="2">If you have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:</verse>
  <verse number="3">How that by revelation he made known to me the mystery; (as I wrote before in few words,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Whereby, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)</verse>
  <verse number="5">Which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="6">That the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:</verse>
  <verse number="7">Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effectual working of his power.</verse>
  <verse number="8">To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="9">And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world has been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="10">To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,</verse>
  <verse number="11">According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:</verse>
  <verse number="12">In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Why I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For this cause I bow my knees to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
  <verse number="15">Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,</verse>
  <verse number="16">That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;</verse>
  <verse number="17">That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,</verse>
  <verse number="18">May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;</verse>
  <verse number="19">And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Now to him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,</verse>
  <verse number="21">To him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen.</verse>
