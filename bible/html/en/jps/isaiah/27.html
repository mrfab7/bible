<p class="verse" data-verse="1">In that day the LORD with His sore and great and strong sword will punish leviathan the slant serpent, and leviathan the tortuous serpent; and He will slay the dragon that is in the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">In that day sing ye of her: ‘A vineyard of foaming wine!’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I the LORD do guard it, I water it every moment; Lest Mine anger visit it, I guard it night and day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Fury is not in Me; Would that I were as the briers and thorns in flame! I would with one step burn it altogether.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Or else let him take hold of My strength, That he may make peace with Me; yea, let him make peace with Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In days to come shall Jacob take root, Israel shall blossom and bud; And the face of the world shall be filled with fruitage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Hath He smitten him as He smote those that smote him? Or is he slain according to the slaughter of them that were slain by Him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">In full measure, when Thou sendest her away, Thou dost contend with her; He hath removed her with His rough blast in the day of the east wind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Therefore by this shall the iniquity of Jacob be expiated, And this is all the fruit of taking away his sin: When he maketh all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in pieces, So that the Asherim and the sun-images shall rise no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For the fortified city is solitary, A habitation abandoned and forsaken, like the wilderness; There shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down, And consume the branches thereof</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">When the boughs thereof are withered, They shall be broken off; The women shall come, and set them on fire; For it is a people of no understanding; Therefore He that made them will not have compassion upon them, And He that formed them will not be gracious unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And it shall come to pass in that day, That the LORD will beat off [His fruit] From the flood of the River unto the Brook of Egypt, And ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And it shall come to pass in that day, That a great horn shall be blown; And they shall come that were lost in the land of Assyria, And they that were dispersed in the land of Egypt; And they shall worship the LORD in the holy mountain at Jerusalem.</p>
