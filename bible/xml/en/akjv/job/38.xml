<chapter book="Job" number="38" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Gird up now your loins like a man; for I will demand of you, and answer you me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if you have understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Who has laid the measures thereof, if you know? or who has stretched the line on it?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;</verse>
  <verse number="7">When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?</verse>
  <verse number="9">When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddling cloth for it,</verse>
  <verse number="10">And broke up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,</verse>
  <verse number="11">And said, Till now shall you come, but no further: and here shall your proud waves be stayed?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Have you commanded the morning since your days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;</verse>
  <verse number="13">That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?</verse>
  <verse number="14">It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And from the wicked their light is withheld, and the high arm shall be broken.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Have you entered into the springs of the sea? or have you walked in the search of the depth?</verse>
  <verse number="17">Have the gates of death been opened to you? or have you seen the doors of the shadow of death?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Have you perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if you know it all.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Where is the way where light dwells? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,</verse>
  <verse number="20">That you should take it to the bound thereof, and that you should know the paths to the house thereof?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Know you it, because you were then born? or because the number of your days is great?</verse>
  <verse number="22">Have you entered into the treasures of the snow? or have you seen the treasures of the hail,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?</verse>
  <verse number="24">By what way is the light parted, which scatters the east wind on the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="25">Who has divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;</verse>
  <verse number="26">To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;</verse>
  <verse number="27">To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?</verse>
  <verse number="28">Has the rain a father? or who has begotten the drops of dew?</verse>
  <verse number="29">Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who has gendered it?</verse>
  <verse number="30">The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Can you bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?</verse>
  <verse number="32">Can you bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or can you guide Arcturus with his sons?</verse>
  <verse number="33">Know you the ordinances of heaven? can you set the dominion thereof in the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="34">Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover you?</verse>
  <verse number="35">Can you send lightning, that they may go and say to you, Here we are?</verse>
  <verse number="36">Who has put wisdom in the inward parts? or who has given understanding to the heart?</verse>
  <verse number="37">Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,</verse>
  <verse number="38">When the dust grows into hardness, and the clods stuck fast together?</verse>
  <verse number="39">Will you hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,</verse>
  <verse number="40">When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?</verse>
  <verse number="41">Who provides for the raven his food? when his young ones cry to God, they wander for lack of meat.</verse>
