<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="13" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Behold my eye hath seen all these things, and my ear hath heard them, and I have understood them all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">According to your knowledge I also know: neither am I inferior to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But yet I will speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Having first shewn that you are forgers of lies, and maintainers of perverse opinions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And I wish you would hold your peace, that you might be thought to be wise men..</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Hear ye therefore my reproof, and attend to the judgment of my lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Hath God any need of your lie, that you should speak deceitfully for him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Do you accept his person, and do you endeavour to judge for God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Or shall it please him, from whom nothing can be concealed ? or shall he be deceived as a man, with your deceitful dealings ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He shall reprove you, because in secret you accept his person.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">As soon as he shall move himself, he shall trouble you: and his dread shall fall upon you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Your remembrance shall be compared to ashes, and your necks shall be brought to clay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hold your peace a little while, that I may speak whatsoever my mind shall suggest to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Why do I tear my flesh with my teeth, and carry my soul in my hands?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Although he should bill me, I will trust in him: but yet I will reprove my ways in his sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he shall be my saviour: for no hypocrite shall come before his presence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Hear ye my speech, and receive with Sour ears hidden truths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If I shall be judged, I know that I shall be found just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Who is he that will plead against me? let him come: why am I consumed holding my peace?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Two things only do not to me, and then from thy face I shall not be hid:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Withdraw thy hand far from me, and let not thy dread terrify me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Call me, and I will answer thee: or else I will speak, and do thou answer me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">How many are my iniquities and sins? make me know my crimes and offences.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Why hidest thou thy face, and thinkest me thy enemy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Against a leaf, that is carried away with the wind, thou shewest thy power, and thou pursuest a dry straw.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For thou writest bitter things against me, and wilt consume me for the sins of my youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Thou hast put my feet in the stocks, and hast observed all my paths, and hast considered the steps of my feet:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Who am to be consumed as rottenness, and as a garment that is moth-eaten.</p>
