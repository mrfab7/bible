  <verse number="1">And Saul was consenting to his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ to them.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the people with one accord gave heed to those things which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And there was great joy in that city.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</verse>
  <verse number="10">To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John:</verse>
  <verse number="15">Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</verse>
  <verse number="16">(For as yet he was fallen on none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</verse>
  <verse number="17">Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</verse>
  <verse number="19">Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But Peter said to him, Your money perish with you, because you have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</verse>
  <verse number="21">You have neither part nor lot in this matter: for your heart is not right in the sight of God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then answered Simon, and said, Pray you to the LORD for me, that none of these things which you have spoken come on me.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</verse>
  <verse number="28">Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Then the Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and join yourself to this chariot.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understand you what you read?</verse>
  <verse number="31">And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</verse>
  <verse number="33">In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray you, of whom speaks the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?</verse>
  <verse number="35">Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached to him Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what does hinder me to be baptized?</verse>
  <verse number="37">And Philip said, If you believe with all your heart, you may. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.</verse>
  <verse number="40">But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</verse>
