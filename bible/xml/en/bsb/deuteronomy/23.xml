  <verse number="4">For they did not meet you with food and water on your way out of Egypt, and they hired Balaam son of Beor from Pethor in Aram-naharaim to curse you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Yet the LORD your God would not listen to Balaam, and the LORD your God turned the curse into a blessing for you, because the LORD your God loves you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">You are not to seek peace or prosperity from them as long as you live.</verse>

  <verse number="21">If you make a vow to the LORD your God, do not be slow to keep it, because He will surely require it of you, and you will be guilty of sin.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But if you refrain from making a vow, you will not be guilty of sin.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Be careful to follow through on what comes from your lips, because you have freely vowed to the LORD your God with your own mouth.</verse>
