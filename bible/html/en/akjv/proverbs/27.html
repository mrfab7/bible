<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Boast not yourself of to morrow; for you know not what a day may bring forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool’s wrath is heavier than them both.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Open rebuke is better than secret love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The full soul loathes an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">As a bird that wanders from her nest, so is a man that wanders from his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so does the sweetness of a man’s friend by hearty counsel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Your own friend, and your father’s friend, forsake not; neither go into your brother’s house in the day of your calamity: for better is a neighbor that is near than a brother far off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproaches me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A prudent man foresees the evil, and hides himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He that blesses his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Whoever hides her hides the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which denudes itself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Iron sharpens iron; so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Whoever keeps the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waits on his master shall be honored.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">As in water face answers to face, so the heart of man to man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Though you should bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Be you diligent to know the state of your flocks, and look well to your herds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For riches are not for ever: and does the crown endure to every generation?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The hay appears, and the tender grass shows itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The lambs are for your clothing, and the goats are the price of the field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And you shall have goats’ milk enough for your food, for the food of your household, and for the maintenance for your maidens.</p>
