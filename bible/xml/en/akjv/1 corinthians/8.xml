<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="8" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And if any man think that he knows any thing, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But if any man love God, the same is known of him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)</verse>
  <verse number="6">But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">However, there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol to this hour eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But meat commends us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For if any man see you which have knowledge sit at meat in the idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;</verse>
  <verse number="11">And through your knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?</verse>
  <verse number="12">But when you sin so against the brothers, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Why, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world stands, lest I make my brother to offend.</verse>
