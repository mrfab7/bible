<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="28" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The wicked man fleeth, when no man pursueth: but the just, bold as a lion, shall be without dread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For the sine of the land many are the princes thereof: and for the wisdom of a man, and the knowledge of those things that are said, the life of the prince shall be prolonged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A poor man that oppresseth the poor, is like a violent shower, which bringeth a famine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They that forsake the law, praise the wicked man: they that keep it, are incensed against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Evil men think not on judgment: but they that seek after the Lord, take notice of all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Better is the poor man walking in his simplicity, than the rich in crooked ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He that keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that feedeth gluttons, shameth his father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that heapeth together riches by usury and loan, gathereth them for him that will be bountiful to the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He that turneth away his ears from hearing the law, his prayer shall be as abomination.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He that deceiveth the just in a wicked way, shall fall in his own destruction: and the upright shall possess his goods.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The rich man seemeth to himself wise: but the poor man that is prudent shall search him out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">In the joy of the just there is great glory: when the wicked reign, men are ruined.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He that hideth his sins, shall not prosper: but he that shall confess, and forsake them, shall obtain mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Blessed is the man that is always fearful: but he that is hardened in mind, shall fall into evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">As a roaring lion, and a hungry bear, so is a wicked prince over the poor people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A prince void of prudence shall oppress many by calumny: but he that hateth covetousness, shall prolong his days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A man that doth violence to the blood of a person, if he flee even to the pit, no man will stay him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He that walketh uprightly, shall be saved: he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He that tilleth his ground, shall be filled with bread: but he that followeth idleness shall be filled with poverty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A faithful man shall be much praised: but he that maketh haste to be rich, shall not be innocent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He that hath respect to a person in judgment, doth not well: such a man even for a morsel of bread forsaketh the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A man, that maketh haste to be rich, and envieth others, is ignorant that poverty shall come upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He that rebuketh a man, shall afterward find favour with him, more than he that by a flattering tongue deceiveth him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He that stealeth any thing from his father, or from his mother: and saith, This is no sin, is the partner of a murderer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He that boasteth, and puffeth up himself, stirreth up quarrels: but he that trusteth in the Lord, shall be healed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He that trusteth in his own heart, is a fool: but he that walketh wisely, he shall be saved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He that giveth to the poor, shall not want: he that despiseth his entreaty, shall suffer indigence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">When the wicked rise up, men shall hide themselves: when they perish, the just shall be multiplied.</p>
