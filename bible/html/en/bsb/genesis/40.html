<div class="chapter" data-book="Genesis" data-chapter="40" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Some time later, the king’s cupbearer and baker offended their master, the king of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and imprisoned them in the house of the captain of the guard, the same prison where Joseph was confined.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he became their personal attendant. After they had been in custody for some time,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">both of these men—the Egyptian king’s cupbearer and baker, who were being held in the prison—had a dream on the same night, and each dream had its own meaning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they were distraught.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">So he asked the officials of Pharaoh who were in custody with him in his master’s house, “Why are your faces so downcast today?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">“We both had dreams,” they replied, “but there is no one to interpret them.” Then Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">So the chief cupbearer told Joseph his dream: “In my dream there was a vine before me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and on the vine were three branches. As it budded, its blossoms opened and its clusters ripened into grapes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into his cup, and placed the cup in his hand.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Joseph replied, “This is the interpretation: The three branches are three days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore your position. You will put Pharaoh’s cup in his hand, just as you did when you were his cupbearer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But when it goes well for you, please remember me and show me kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh, that he might bring me out of this prison.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews, and even here I have done nothing for which they should have put me in this dungeon.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, “I too had a dream: There were three baskets of white bread on my head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">In the top basket were all sorts of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Joseph replied, “This is the interpretation: The three baskets are three days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Within three days Pharaoh will lift off your head and hang you on a tree. Then the birds will eat the flesh of your body.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he held a feast for all his officials, and in their presence he lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Pharaoh restored the chief cupbearer to his position, so that he once again placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But Pharaoh hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had described to them in his interpretation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The chief cupbearer, however, did not remember Joseph; he forgot all about him.</p>
