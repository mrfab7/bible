  <verse number="1">These are the lodging places of the sons of Israel, who departed from Egypt by their companies under the hand of Moses and Aaron,</verse>
  <verse number="2">which Moses wrote down according to the places of the encampments, which they changed upon the order of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thus the sons of Israel set out from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month, on the day after the Passover, with an exalted hand, being seen by all the Egyptians.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And these were burying their firstborn, whom the Lord had struck down (for so, too, did he carry out retribution against their gods).</verse>
  <verse number="5">And they made camp at Soccoth.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And from Soccoth they went to Etham, which is at the furthest limits of the wilderness.</verse>

  <verse number="9">And setting out from Marah, they arrived at Elim, where there were twelve fountains of water and seventy palm trees. And they set up camp there.</verse>

  <verse number="32">And setting out from Bene-jaakan, they went to mount Gidgad.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Setting out from there, they were encamped at Jotbathah.</verse>

  <verse number="35">And departing from Abronah, they made camp at Eziongeber.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Setting out from there, they went into the desert of Sin, which is Kadesh.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And departing from Kadesh, they encamped at mount Hor, at the furthermost limits of the land of Edom.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And Aaron the priest ascended onto mount Hor, by the order of the Lord. And there he died, in the fortieth year of the departure of the sons of Israel from Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month,</verse>
  <verse number="39">when he was one hundred twenty-three years old.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And king Arad the Canaanite, who lived toward the south, heard that the sons of Israel had arrived in the land of Canaan.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And setting out from mount Hor, they made camp at Zalmonah.</verse>
  <verse number="42">Departing from there, they went to Punon.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And setting out from Punon, they were encamped at Oboth.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And from Oboth, they went to Iye-abarim, which is at the borders of the Moabites.</verse>

  <verse number="48">And setting out from the mountains of Abarim, they crossed over to the plains of Moab, above the Jordan, opposite Jericho.</verse>
  <verse number="49">And they made camp there, from Beth-jeshimoth all the way to Abel-shittim, in the level places of the Moabites,</verse>
  <verse number="50">where the Lord said to Moses:</verse>
  <verse number="51">“Instruct the sons of Israel, and say to them: When you will have crossed over the Jordan, entering into the land of Canaan,</verse>
  <verse number="52">destroy all the inhabitants of that land. Break their monuments, and shatter their statues, and lay waste to every exalted thing,</verse>
  <verse number="53">cleansing the land and living in it. For I have given it you as a possession,</verse>
  <verse number="54">which you shall divide among you by lot. To the greater number you shall give more, and to the lesser number, less. To each one, just as the lot shall fall, so shall the inheritance be distributed. The possession shall be divided by the tribes and families.</verse>
  <verse number="55">But if you are not willing to put to death the inhabitants of the land, those who remain shall be to you like spikes in your eyes and lances in your sides, and they shall be adversaries to you in the land of your habitation.</verse>
  <verse number="56">And whatever I had decided to do to them, I will do to you.”</verse>
