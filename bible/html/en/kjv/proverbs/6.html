<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="6" data-translation="King James Bible" data-translation-id="kjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, [if] thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand [of the hunter], and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Provideth her meat in the summer, [and] gathereth her food in the harvest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">[Yet] a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Frowardness [is] in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">These six [things] doth the LORD hate: yea, seven [are] an abomination unto him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A false witness [that] speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My son, keep thy father’s commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Bind them continually upon thine heart, [and] tie them about thy neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and [when] thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For the commandment [is] a lamp; and the law [is] light; and reproofs of instruction [are] the way of life:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For by means of a whorish woman [a man is brought] to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">[Men] do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But [if] he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">[But] whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he [that] doeth it destroyeth his own soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For jealousy [is] the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</p>
