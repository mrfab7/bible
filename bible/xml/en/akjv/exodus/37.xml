  <verse number="8">One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the cherubim on the two ends thereof.</verse>

  <verse number="18">And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:</verse>
  <verse number="19">Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a bud and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in another branch, a bud and a flower: so throughout the six branches going out of the candlestick.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his knops, and his flowers:</verse>
  <verse number="21">And a bud under two branches of the same, and a bud under two branches of the same, and a bud under two branches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was one beaten work of pure gold.</verse>
