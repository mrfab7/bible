  <verse number="1">And a certain man was in Cesarea by name Cornelius, a centurion of the band called Italian,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Religious, and fearing God with all his house, and doing many alms to the people, and praying God always.</verse>
  <verse number="3">He saw in a vision manifestly about the ninth hour of the day a messenger of God having come in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And having looked at him intently, and being afraid, he said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayers and thine alms went up for remembrance before God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And now send men to Joppa, and send for Simon, who is called Peter:</verse>
  <verse number="6">He is received as guest with a certain Simon a currier, to whom is a house by the sea: he shall speak to thee what thou must do.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And when the messenger speaking to Cornelius departed, having called two of his servants, and a religious soldier of those persevering with him;</verse>
  <verse number="8">And having related all to them, he sent them to Joppa.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the morrow, these traveling, and drawing near to the city, Peter went up upon the house to pray about the sixth hour:</verse>
  <verse number="10">And he was hungry, and would have eaten: and these making ready, a deep trance fell upon him,</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he sees heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending upon him, as a great linen napkin fastened at the four beginnings, and laid down upon the earth:</verse>
  <verse number="12">In which were all the quadrupeds of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and the flying things of heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And a voice was to him, Having risen, Peter, kill, and eat.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Peter said, By no means, Lord; for never ate I anything common or unclean.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And a voice again of a second time to him, What things God cleansed, do not thou make common.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And this was for thrice: and again was the vessel taken up into heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And as Peter was doubting in himself what the vision might be which he saw, and behold, the man sent from Cornelius having asked for Simon’s house, stood at the gate,</verse>
  <verse number="18">And having called, they were inquiring if Simon, surnamed Peter, is received there as a guest.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Peter reflecting concerning the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek thee.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But thou having risen, come down, and go with them, discussing nothing; for I have sent them.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Peter having come down to the men sent from Cornelius to him, said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what the cause for which ye are present?</verse>
  <verse number="22">And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and fearing God, and witnessed of by the whole nation of the Jews, received intimation of the divine will by a holy messenger to send for thee to his house, and hear words of thee.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Therefore having called them in, he received as guests. And on the morrow Peter came forth with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa came with him.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the morrow he came to Cesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and friends by relationship.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And it was as Peter came in, Cornelius having met him, having fallen at his feet, worshipped.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And Peter raised him up, saying, Arise: I am also myself man.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And discoursing with him, he came in, and finds many come together.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And he said to them, Ye know that it is violating law for a man a Jew to join himself, or come near to a strange tribe: and God shewed me to call no man common or unclean.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And therefore came I without contradiction, having been sent for; therefore I inquire for what word ye sent for me?</verse>
  <verse number="30">And Cornelius said, From the fourth day till this hour I was fasting; and the ninth hour praying in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</verse>
  <verse number="31">And he says, Cornelius, thy prayer was harkened to, and thine alms remembered before God.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Therefore send to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he is received as guest in the house of Simon the currier by the sea: who, being present, shall speak to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="33">From this therefore sent I to thee: and thou didst well being present. Now therefore are all we present before God, to hear all commanded thee of God.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Peter having opened the month; said, of a truth I comprehend that God is no respecter of faces!</verse>
  <verse number="35">But in every nation he fearing him, and working justice, is acceptable to him.</verse>
  <verse number="36">The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, announcing good news, peace through Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all.)</verse>
  <verse number="37">The word ye know, having been through the whole of Judea, having begun from Galilee, after the immersion which John preached;</verse>
  <verse number="38">Jesus from Nazareth, how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and power; who passed through doing good, and healing all oppressed by the devil; for God was with him.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And ye are witnesses of all which he did in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they killed, having hanged upon wood:</verse>
  <verse number="40">Him God raised the third day, and gave him to be manifest;</verse>
  <verse number="41">Not to all people, but to witnesses chosen before by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after his rising from the dead.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And he enjoined us to proclaim to the people, and to testify that this is he appointed by God, Judge of the living and the dead.</verse>
  <verse number="43">To him all the prophets testify, for all believing on him to receive remission of sins through his name.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Peter yet speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all hearing the word.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And believers of the circumcision were affected in mind, as many as came with Peter, that also upon the nations the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out.</verse>
  <verse number="46">For they heard them speaking with tongues, and magnifying God. Then answered Peter,</verse>
  <verse number="47">Much less can any hinder water, for these not to be immersed, who received the Holy Spirit as also we?</verse>
  <verse number="48">And he commanded them to be immersed in the name of the Lord. Then asked they him to remain certain days.</verse>
