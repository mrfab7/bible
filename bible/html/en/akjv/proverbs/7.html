<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="7" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of your eye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Bind them on your fingers, write them on the table of your heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Say to wisdom, You are my sister; and call understanding your kinswoman:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">That they may keep you from the strange woman, from the stranger which flatters with her words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtle of heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">(She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now is she without, now in the streets, and lies in wait at every corner.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said to him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I have peace offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Therefore came I forth to meet you, diligently to seek your face, and I have found you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For the manager is not at home, he is gone a long journey:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He has taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He goes after her straightway, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hastens to the snare, and knows not that it is for his life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Listen to me now therefore, O you children, and attend to the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Let not your heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For she has cast down many wounded: yes, many strong men have been slain by her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.</p>
