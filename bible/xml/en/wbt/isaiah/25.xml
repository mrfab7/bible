  <verse number="3">Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For thou hast been a defense to the poor, a defense to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thou wilt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shade of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.</verse>

  <verse number="12">And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls will he bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.</verse>
