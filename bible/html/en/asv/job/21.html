<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear diligently my speech; And let this be your consolations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Suffer me, and I also will speak; And after that I have spoken, mock on.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">As for me, is my complaint to man? And why should I not be impatient?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Mark me, and be astonished, And lay your hand upon your mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Even when I remember I am troubled, And horror taketh hold on my flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wherefore do the wicked live, Become old, yea, wax mighty in power?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Their seed is established with them in their sight, And their offspring before their eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Their houses are safe from fear, Neither is the rod of God upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; Their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They send forth their little ones like a flock, And their children dance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They sing to the timbrel and harp, And rejoice at the sound of the pipe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They spend their days in prosperity, And in a moment they go down to Sheol.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And they say unto God, Depart from us; For we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand: The counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity cometh upon them? That God distributeth sorrows in his anger?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">That they are as stubble before the wind, And as chaff that the storm carrieth away?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Ye say, God layeth up his iniquity for his children. Let him recompense it unto himself, that he may know it:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Let his own eyes see his destruction, And let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For what careth he for his house after him, When the number of his months is cut off?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Shall any teach God knowledge, Seeing he judgeth those that are high?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">One dieth in his full strength, Being wholly at ease and quiet:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">His pails are full of milk, And the marrow of his bones is moistened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And another dieth in bitterness of soul, And never tasteth of good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">They lie down alike in the dust, And the worm covereth them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Behold, I know your thoughts, And the devices wherewith ye would wrong me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? And where is the tent wherein the wicked dwelt?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Have ye not asked wayfaring men? And do ye not know their evidences,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">That the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity? That they are led forth to the day of wrath?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Who shall declare his way to his face? And who shall repay him what he hath done?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Yet shall he be borne to the grave, And men shall keep watch over the tomb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, And all men shall draw after him, As there were innumerable before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">How then comfort ye me in vain, Seeing in your answers there remaineth only falsehood?</p>
