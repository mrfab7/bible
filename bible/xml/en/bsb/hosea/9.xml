<chapter book="Hosea" number="9" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Do not rejoice, O Israel, with exultation like the nations, for you have played the harlot against your God; you have made love for hire on every threshing floor.</verse>
  <verse number="2">The threshing floor and winepress will not feed them, and the new wine will fail them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">They will not remain in the land of the LORD; Ephraim will return to Egypt and eat unclean food in Assyria.</verse>
  <verse number="4">They will not pour out wine offerings to the LORD, and their sacrifices will not please Him, but will be to them like the bread of mourners; all who eat will be defiled. For their bread will be for themselves; it will not enter the house of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="5">What will you do on the appointed day, on the day of the LORD’s feast?</verse>
  <verse number="6">For even if they flee destruction, Egypt will gather them and Memphis will bury them. Their precious silver will be taken over by thistles, and thorns will overrun their tents.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The days of punishment have come; the days of retribution have arrived—let Israel know it. The prophet is called a fool, and the inspired man insane, because of the greatness of your iniquity and hostility.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The prophet is Ephraim’s watchman, along with my God, yet the snare of the fowler lies on all his paths. Hostility is in the house of his God!</verse>
  <verse number="9">They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah; He will remember their guilt; He will punish their sins.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness. I saw your fathers as the firstfruits of the fig tree in its first season. But they went to Baal-peor, and consecrated themselves to Shame; so they became as detestable as the thing they loved.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Ephraim’s glory will fly away like a bird, with no birth, no pregnancy, and no conception.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Even if they raise their children, I will bereave them of each one. Yes, woe be to them when I turn away from them!</verse>
  <verse number="13">I have seen Ephraim, like Tyre, planted in a meadow. But Ephraim will bring out his children for slaughter.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Give them, O LORD—what will You give? Give them wombs that miscarry and breasts that dry up!</verse>
  <verse number="15">All their evil appears at Gilgal, for there I hated them. I will drive them from My house for the wickedness of their deeds. I will no longer love them; all their leaders are rebellious.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Ephraim is struck down; their root is withered; they cannot bear fruit. Even if they bear children, I will slay the darlings of their wombs.</verse>
  <verse number="17">My God will reject them because they have not obeyed Him; and they shall be wanderers among the nations.</verse>
