<p class="verse" data-verse="1">O LORD, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For thou hast made of a city a heap; of a fortified city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For thou hast been a defense to the poor, a defense to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shade from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thou wilt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shade of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And on this mountain will the LORD of hosts make to all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he will destroy on this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people will he remove from all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD, we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For on this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And he will spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he will bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls will he bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.</p>
