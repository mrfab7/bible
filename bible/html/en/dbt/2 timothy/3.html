<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But this know, that in [the] last days difficult times shall be there;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">for men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, evil speakers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, profane,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, of unsubdued passions, savage, having no love for what is good,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">traitors, headlong, of vain pretensions, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">having a form of piety but denying the power of it: and from these turn away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For of these are they who are getting into houses, and leading captive silly women, laden with sins, led by various lusts,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">always learning, and never able to come to [the] knowledge of [the] truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Now in the same manner in which Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, thus these also withstand the truth; men corrupted in mind, found worthless as regards the faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But they shall not advance farther; for their folly shall be completely manifest to all, as that of those also became.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But thou hast been thoroughly acquainted with my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, endurance,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">persecutions, sufferings: what [sufferings] happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, in Lystra; what persecutions I endured; and the Lord delivered me out of all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And all indeed who desire to live piously in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But wicked men and juggling impostors shall advance in evil, leading and being led astray.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But thou, abide in those things which thou hast learned, and [of which] thou hast been fully persuaded, knowing of whom thou hast learned [them];</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and that from a child thou hast known the sacred letters, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation, through faith which [is] in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Every scripture [is] divinely inspired, and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">that the man of God may be complete, fully fitted to every good work.</p>
