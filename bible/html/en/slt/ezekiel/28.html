<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Son of man, say to the leader of Tyre, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because thy heart was lifted up, and thou wilt say, I am God, I sat upon the seat of God in the heart of the seas; and thou art man and not God, and thou wilt give thy heart as the heart of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Behold thee wise above Daniel; not any thing hidden was hidden to thee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">With thy wisdom and with thy understanding thou madest to thee wealth, and thou wilt make gold and silver in thy treasures.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">By the multitude of thy wisdom, by thy traffic thou didst multiply thy wealth, and thine heart will be lifted up in thy wealth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Because of thy giving thy heart as the heart of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For this, behold me bringing strangers upon thee, the terrible of the nations: and they emptied out their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they profaned thy splendor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou didst die the deaths of the wounded in the heart of the seas.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Saying, wilt thou say, I am God, before him slaying thee? and thou art man and not God, in the hand of him wounding thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thou shalt die the deaths of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I spake, says the Lord Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Son of man, lift up a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Thou didst seal up the measure full of wisdom and complete of beauty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Thou wert in Eden the garden of God: every precious stone thy covering, the ruby, the topaz, the onyx, the chrysolite, the sardonyx and the jasper, the sapphire, the carbuncle and the emerald, and gold: the work of thy drums and thy pipes were prepared in thee in the day of thy being created.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thou the cherub of expansion covering; and I gave thee: thou wert in the holy mountain of God; thou walkedst about in the midst of the stones of fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thou shalt be perfected in thy ways from the day of thy being created even till iniquity was found in thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">In the multitude of thy traffic they filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou wilt sin: and I shall profane thee from the mountain of God, and destroying thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Thine heart was lifted up with thy beauty, thou didst corrupt thy wisdom on account of thy splendor: I cast thee upon the earth, I gave thee before kings to look upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">From the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic, thou didst profane my holy places; and I will bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall consume thee, and I will give thee for ashes upon the earth before the eyes of all seeing thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">All knowing thee among the peoples were astonished at thee: thou wert terrors; and thou not, even to forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Son of man, set thy face against Zidon and prophesy against, her,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against, thee, O Zidon; and I was honored in the midst of thee, and they shall know that I am Jehovah, in my doing judgments upon her; and I was consecrated in her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And I sent death into her, and blood in her streets; and the wounded fell in the midst of her by, the sword upon her from round about: and they shall know that I am Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And no more shall there be to the house of Israel a thorn making bitter; and briars causing pain from all round about them despising them; and they shall know that I am the Lord Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: in my gathering the house of Israel from the peoples where they were scattered among them, and I was consecrated in them before the eyes of the nations, and they shall dwell in the land which I gave to my servant Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And they dwelt upon it with confidence, and, they built houses, and they planted vineyards; and they dwelt with confidence in my doing judgments upon all those despising them from round about them; and they shall know that I am Jehovah their God.</p>
