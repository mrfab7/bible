  <verse number="3">I also have a heart as well as you: for who is ignorant of these things, which you know?</verse>
  <verse number="4">He that is mocked by his friends as I, shall call upon God and he will hear him: for the simplicity of the just man is laughed to scorn.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The lamp despised in the thoughts of the rich, is ready for the time appointed.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The tabernacles of robbers abound, and they provoke God boldly; whereas it is he that hath given all into their hands:</verse>
  <verse number="7">But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee: and the birds of the air, and they shall tell thee.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Speak to the earth, and it shall answer thee: and the fishes of the sea shall tell.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Who is ignorant that the hand of the Lord hath made all these things?</verse>
  <verse number="10">In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all flesh of man.</verse>

  <verse number="13">With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.</verse>

  <verse number="21">He poureth contempt upon princes, and relieveth them that were oppressed.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth up to light the shadow of death.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He multiplieth nations, and destroyeth them, and restoreth them again after they were overthrown.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He changeth the heart of the princes of the people of the earth, and deceiveth them that they walk in vain where there is no way.</verse>
  <verse number="25">They shall grope as in the dark, and not in the light, and he shall make them stagger like men that are drunk.</verse>
