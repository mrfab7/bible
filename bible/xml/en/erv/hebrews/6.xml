<chapter book="Hebrews" number="6" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Wherefore let us cease to speak of the first principles of Christ, and press on unto perfection; not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</verse>
  <verse number="2">of the teaching of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And this will we do, if God permit.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For as touching those who were once enlightened and tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</verse>
  <verse number="5">and tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come,</verse>
  <verse number="6">and then fell away, it is impossible to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For the land which hath drunk the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them for whose sake it is also tilled, receiveth blessing from God:</verse>
  <verse number="8">but if it beareth thorns and thistles, it is rejected and nigh unto a curse; whose end is to be burned.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak:</verse>
  <verse number="10">for God is not unrighteous to forget your work and the love which ye shewed toward his name, in that ye ministered unto the saints, and still do minister.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And we desire that each one of you may shew the same diligence unto the fulness of hope even to the end:</verse>
  <verse number="12">that ye be not sluggish, but imitators of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For when God made promise to Abraham, since he could swear by none greater, he sware by himself,</verse>
  <verse number="14">saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And thus, having patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For men swear by the greater: and in every dispute of theirs the oath is final for confirmation.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Wherein God, being minded to shew more abundantly unto the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, interposed with an oath:</verse>
  <verse number="18">that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before us;</verse>
  <verse number="19">which we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and stedfast and entering into that which is within the veil;</verse>
  <verse number="20">whither as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become a high priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
