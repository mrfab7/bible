<chapter book="2 Peter" number="1" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,</verse>
  <verse number="3">According as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:</verse>
  <verse number="4">Whereby are given to us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;</verse>
  <verse number="6">And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;</verse>
  <verse number="7">And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that you shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But he that lacks these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Why the rather, brothers, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if you do these things, you shall never fall:</verse>
  <verse number="11">For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Why I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though you know them, and be established in the present truth.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Yes, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ has showed me.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Moreover I will endeavor that you may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For he received from God the Father honor and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.</verse>
  <verse number="19">We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:</verse>
  <verse number="20">Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</verse>
