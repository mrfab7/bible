  <verse number="1">And afterwards Moses and Aaron went in, and said to Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Let my people go that they may celebrate a feast to me in the wilderness.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah, to whose voice I am to hearken to let Israel go? I do not know Jehovah, neither will I let Israel go.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to Jehovah our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with sword.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do ye, Moses and Aaron, wish to have the people go off from their works? Away, to your burdens!</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Pharaoh said, Behold the people of the land are now many, and ye wish to make them rest from their burdens.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="7">Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the number of the bricks they have made heretofore shall ye lay upon them: ye shall not diminish any of it, for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go [and] sacrifice to our God.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Let them put heavier labour on the men, that they may be taken up with it, and not regard vain words.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the taskmasters of the people and their officers went out and spoke to the people, saying, Thus says Pharaoh: I will not give you straw:</verse>
  <verse number="11">go ye, get yourselves straw where ye may find it; but none of your work shall be diminished.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the people were scattered abroad throughout the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the taskmasters urged [them], saying, Fulfil your labours, the daily work, as when there was straw.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, [and] it was said, Why have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick, both yesterday and to-day, as heretofore?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why dost thou deal thus with thy bondmen?</verse>
  <verse number="16">There is no straw given to thy bondmen, and they say to us, Make brick; and behold, thy bondmen are beaten, but it is the fault of thy people.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he said, Ye are idle, idle! therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And now go—work! and straw shall not be given you, and ye shall deliver the measure of bricks.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the officers of the children of Israel saw [that] it stood ill with them, because it was said, Ye shall not diminish anything from your bricks, the daily work.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood there to meet them, as they came out from Pharaoh.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they said to them, Jehovah look upon you and judge, that ye have made our odour to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his bondmen, putting a sword into their hand to kill us!</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Moses returned to Jehovah, and said, Lord, why hast thou done evil to this people? why now hast thou sent me?</verse>
  <verse number="23">For ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all!</verse>
