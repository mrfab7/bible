<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And sons of Cush are Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah; and sons of Raamah are Sheba and Dedan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Cush hath begotten Nimrod;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">he hath begun to be a hero in the land; he hath been a hero in hunting before Jehovah; therefore it is said, ‘As Nimrod the hero in hunting before Jehovah.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the first part of his kingdom is Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">from that land he hath gone out to Asshur, and buildeth Nineveh, even the broad places of the city, and Calah,</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="17">and the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">and the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite; and afterwards have the families of the Canaanite been scattered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the border of the Canaanite is from Sidon, in thy coming towards Gerar, unto Gaza; in thy coming towards Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, unto Lasha.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">These are sons of Ham, by their families, by their tongues, in their lands, in their nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">As to Shem, father of all sons of Eber, brother of Japheth the elder, he hath also begotten:</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And sons of Aram are Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Arphaxad hath begotten Salah, and Salah hath begotten Eber.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And to Eber have two sons been born; the name of the one is Peleg (for in his days hath the earth been divided,) and his brother’s name is Joktan.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="30">and their dwelling is from Mesha, in thy coming towards Sephar, a mount of the east.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">These are sons of Shem, by their families, by their tongues, in their lands, by their nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">These are families of the sons of Noah, by their births, in their nations, and by these have the nations been parted in the earth after the deluge.</p>
