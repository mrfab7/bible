<chapter book="Proverbs" number="5" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My son! to my wisdom give attention, To mine understanding incline thine ear,</verse>
  <verse number="2">To observe thoughtfulness, And knowledge do thy lips keep.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And smoother than oil is her mouth,</verse>
  <verse number="4">And her latter end is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a sword with mouths.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Her feet are going down to death, Sheol do her steps take hold of.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The path of life—lest thou ponder, Moved have her paths—thou knowest not.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And now, ye sons, hearken to me, And turn not from sayings of my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Keep far from off her thy way, And come not near unto the opening of her house,</verse>
  <verse number="9">Lest thou give to others thy honour, And thy years to the fierce,</verse>
  <verse number="10">Lest strangers be filled with thy power, And thy labours in the house of a stranger,</verse>
  <verse number="11">And thou hast howled in thy latter end, In the consumption of thy flesh and thy food,</verse>
  <verse number="12">And hast said, ‘How have I hated instruction, And reproof hath my heart despised,</verse>
  <verse number="13">And I have not hearkened to the voice of my directors, And to my teachers have not inclined mine ear.</verse>
  <verse number="14">As a little thing I have been all evil, In the midst of an assembly and a company.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Drink waters out of thine own cistern, Even flowing ones out of thine own well.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Let thy fountains be scattered abroad, In broad places rivulets of waters.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Let them be to thee for thyself, And not to strangers with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Let thy fountain be blessed, And rejoice because of the wife of thy youth,</verse>
  <verse number="19">A hind of loves, and a roe of grace! Let her loves satisfy thee at all times, In her love magnify thyself continually.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And why dost thou magnify thyself, My son, with a stranger? And embrace the bosom of a strange woman?</verse>
  <verse number="21">For over-against the eyes of Jehovah are the ways of each, And all his paths He is pondering.</verse>
  <verse number="22">His own iniquities do capture the wicked, And with the ropes of his sin he is holden.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He dieth without instruction, And in the abundance of his folly magnifieth himself!</verse>
