  <verse number="1">Thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And by the seventh day God had finished the work He had been doing; so on that day He rested from all His work.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because on that day He rested from all the work of creation that He had accomplished.</verse>
  <verse number="4">This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth, nor had any plant of the field sprouted, for the LORD God had not yet sent rain upon the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But springs welled up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then the LORD God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed the breath of life into his nostrils, and the man became a living being.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, where He placed the man He had formed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Out of the ground the LORD God gave growth to every tree that is pleasing to the eye and good for food. And in the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it branched into four headwaters:</verse>
  <verse number="11">The name of the first river is the Pishon; it winds through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the gold of that land is pure, and bdellium and onyx are found there.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The name of the second river is the Gihon; it winds through the whole land of Cush.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The name of the third river is the Tigris; it runs along the east side of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then the LORD God took the man and placed him in the Garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the LORD God commanded him, “You may eat freely from every tree of the garden,</verse>
  <verse number="17">but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for in the day that you eat of it, you will surely die.”</verse>
  <verse number="18">The LORD God also said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make for him a suitable helper.”</verse>
  <verse number="19">And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and He brought them to the man to see what he would name each one. And whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The man gave names to all the livestock, to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam no suitable helper was found.</verse>
  <verse number="21">So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep, and while he slept, He took one of the man’s ribs and closed up the area with flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And from the rib that the LORD God had taken from the man, He made a woman and brought her to him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And the man said: “This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called ‘woman,’ for out of man she was taken.”</verse>
  <verse number="24">For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the man and his wife were both naked, and they were not ashamed.</verse>
