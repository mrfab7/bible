<p class="verse" data-verse="1">It happened on the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it, with all its furniture, and the altar with all its vessels, and had anointed and sanctified them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers’ houses, offered. These were the princes of the tribes. These are they who were over those who were numbered:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and they brought their offering before Yahweh, six covered wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of the princes, and for each one an ox: and they presented them before the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">“Accept these from them, that they may be used in doing the service of the Tent of Meeting; and you shall give them to the Levites, to every man according to his service.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.</p>
