  <verse number="1">Then Job answered, and said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Now also my words are in bitterness, and the hand of my scourge is more grievous than my mourning.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Who will grant me that I might know and find him, and come even to his throne?</verse>
  <verse number="4">I would set judgment before him, and would fill my mouth with complaints.</verse>
  <verse number="5">That I might know the words that he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I would not that he should contend with me with much strength, nor overwhelm me with the weight of his greatness.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Let him propose equity against me, and let my judgment come to victory.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But if I go to the east, he appeareth not; if to the west, I shall not understand him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">If to the left hand, what shall I do? I shall not take hold on him: if I turn myself to the right hand, I shall not see him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But he knoweth my way, and has tried me as gold that passeth through the fire:</verse>
  <verse number="11">My foot hath followed his steps, I have kept his way, and have not declined from it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I have not departed from the commandments of his lips, and the words of his mouth I have hid in my bosom.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For he is alone, and no man can turn away his thought: and whatsoever is soul hath desired, that hath he done.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And when he shall have fulfilled his will in me, many other like things are also at hand with him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And therefore I am troubled at his presence, and when I consider him I am made pensive with fear.</verse>
  <verse number="16">God hath softened my heart, and the Almighty hath troubled me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For I have not perished because of the darkness that hangs over me, neither hath the mist covered my face.</verse>
