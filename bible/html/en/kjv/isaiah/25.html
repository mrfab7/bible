<p class="verse" data-verse="1">O LORD, thou [art] my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful [things; thy] counsels of old [are] faithfulness [and] truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For thou hast made of a city an heap; [of] a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones [is] as a storm [against] the wall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; [even] the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken [it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this [is] our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this [is] the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth [his hands] to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, [and] bring to the ground, [even] to the dust.</p>
