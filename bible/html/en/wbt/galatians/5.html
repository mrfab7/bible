<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Stand fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Behold, I Paul say to you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Christ is become of no effect to you, whoever of you are justified by the law; ye have fallen from grace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Ye did run well, who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">This persuasion cometh not from him that calleth you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be no otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whoever he may be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then hath the offense of the cross ceased.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I would they were even cut off who trouble you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For, brethren, ye have been called to liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one by another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye will not fulfill the lust of the flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other; so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these, Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revelings, and such like: of which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And they that are Christâ€™s have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Let us not be desirous of vain-glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</p>
