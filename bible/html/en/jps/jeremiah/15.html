<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then said the LORD unto me: ‘Though Moses and Samuel stood before Me, yet My mind could not be toward this people; cast them out of My sight, and let them go forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it shall come to pass, when they say unto thee: Whither shall we go forth? then thou shall tell them: Thus saith the LORD: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to drag, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and to destroy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I will cause them to be a horror among all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? Or who shall bemoan thee? Or who shall turn aside to ask of thy welfare?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thou hast cast Me off, saith the LORD, Thou art gone backward; Therefore do I stretch out My hand against thee, and destroy thee; I am weary with repenting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I bereave them of children, I destroy My people, Since they return not from their ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Their widows are increased to Me above the sand of the seas; I bring upon them, against the mother, a chosen one, Even a spoiler at noonday; I cause anguish and terrors to fall upon her suddenly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">She that hath borne seven languisheth; Her spirit droopeth; Her sun is gone down while it was yet day, She is ashamed and confounded; And the residue of them will I deliver to the sword before their enemies, Saith the LORD.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me A man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have not lent, neither have men lent to me; Yet every one of them doth curse me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The LORD said: ‘Verily I will release thee for good; verily I will cause the enemy to make supplication unto thee in the time of evil and in the time of affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Can iron break iron from the north and brass?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Thy substance and thy treasures will I give for a spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And I will make thee to pass with thine enemies into a land which thou knowest not; for a fire is kindled in My nostril, which shall burn upon you.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thou, O LORD, knowest; Remember me, and think of me, and avenge me of my persecutors; Take me not away because of Thy long-suffering; Know that for Thy sake I have suffered taunts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Thy words were found, and I did eat them; And Thy words were unto me a joy and the rejoicing of my heart; Because Thy name was called on me, O LORD God of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I sat not in the assembly of them that make merry, nor rejoiced; I sat alone because of Thy hand; For Thou hast filled me with indignation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Why is my pain perpetual, And my wound incurable, so that it refuseth to be healed? Wilt Thou indeed be unto me as a deceitful brook, As waters that fail?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Therefore thus saith the LORD: If thou return, and I bring thee back, Thou shalt stand before Me; And if thou bring forth the precious out of the vile, Thou shalt be as My mouth; Let them return unto thee, But thou shalt not return unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And I will make thee unto this people a fortified brazen wall; And they shall fight against thee, But they shall not prevail against thee; For I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, Saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, And I will redeem thee out of the hand of the terrible.</p>
