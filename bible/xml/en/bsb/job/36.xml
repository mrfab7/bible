  <verse number="1">And Elihu continued:</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Bear with me a little longer, and I will show you that there is more to be said on God’s behalf.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I get my knowledge from afar, and I will ascribe justice to my Maker.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For truly my words are free of falsehood; one perfect in knowledge is with you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Indeed, God is mighty, but He despises no one; He is mighty in strength of understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He does not keep the wicked alive, but He grants justice to the afflicted.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He does not take His eyes off the righteous, but He enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And if men are bound with chains, caught in cords of affliction,</verse>
  <verse number="9">then He tells them their deeds and how arrogantly they have transgressed.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He opens their ears to correction and commands that they turn from iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If they obey and serve Him, then they end their days in prosperity and their years in happiness.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But if they do not obey, then they perish by the sword and die without knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The godless in heart harbor resentment; even when He binds them, they do not cry for help.</verse>
  <verse number="14">They die in their youth, among the male shrine prostitutes.</verse>
  <verse number="15">God rescues the afflicted by their affliction and opens their ears in oppression.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Indeed, He drew you from the jaws of distress to a spacious and broad place, to a table full of richness.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked; judgment and justice have seized you.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Be careful that no one lures you with riches; do not let a large bribe lead you astray.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Can your wealth or all your mighty effort keep you from distress?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Do not long for the night, when people vanish from their homes.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Be careful not to turn to iniquity, for this you have preferred to affliction.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Behold, God is exalted in His power. Who is a teacher like Him?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Who has appointed His way for Him, or told Him, ‘You have done wrong’?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Remember to magnify His work, which men have praised in song.</verse>
  <verse number="25">All mankind has seen it; men behold it from afar.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Indeed, God is great—beyond our knowledge; the number of His years is unsearchable.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For He draws up drops of water which distill the rain from the mist,</verse>
  <verse number="28">which the clouds pour out and shower abundantly on mankind.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Furthermore, who can understand how the clouds spread out, how the thunder roars from His pavilion?</verse>
  <verse number="30">See how He scatters His lightning around Him and covers the depths of the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="31">For by these He judges the nations and provides food in abundance.</verse>
  <verse number="32">He fills His hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark.</verse>
  <verse number="33">The thunder declares His presence; even the cattle regard the rising storm.</verse>
