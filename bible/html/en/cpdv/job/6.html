<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="6" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But Job, responding, said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I wish that my sins, for which I deserve wrath, and the calamity that I endure, were weighed out on a balance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Compared to the sand of the sea, they would appear heavier, and so my words are full of sorrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For the arrows of the Lord are in me, my spirit drinks of their indignation, and the terrors of the Lord are soldiers against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Will the wild ass bray when he has grass? Or will the ox bellow when he stands before a full manger?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Or can one eat bland food, which is not seasoned with salt? Or can anyone taste that which, if tasted, causes death?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The things that my soul was unwilling to touch before, now, because of anguish, are my foods.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Who will grant that my petition may arrive and that God may bestow on me what I expect,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and that he who, at first, had crushed me, will let loose his hand and cut me down?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And may this be my consolation, that in afflicting me with sorrow, although he might not be lenient with me, I still do not contradict the words of the Holy One.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For what is my strength, that I may continue? Or what is my goal, so that I may act patiently?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">My strength is not the strength of stones, nor is my flesh made of bronze.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Behold, there is no help for me in myself, and my loved ones also have withdrawn from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He who takes away mercy from his friend, abandons the fear of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">My brethren have disregarded me, like a torrent that passes swiftly through the steep valleys.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Those who fear frost, snow will rush over them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">At that time, when they are scattered, they will perish, and when it becomes hot, they will be freed from their place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The paths of their steps are entangled; they will walk in vain and will perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Consider the paths of Thema, the ways of Saba, and wait a little while.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">They have been thrown into confusion, just as I had hoped; they have even come to me and are overwhelmed with shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Now you have arrived, and merely by seeing my affliction, you are afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Did I say: “Bring to me and give to me from your necessities?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">or, “Free me from the hand of the enemy and rescue me from the hand of the strong?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Teach me, and I will be silent, and if by chance I have been ignorant of anything, instruct me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Why have you diminished the words of truth, when there is none of you who is able to offer proof against me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">You prepare speeches as so much noise, and you offer words into the wind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">You encroach upon the orphan, and you strive to undermine your friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Such is true, so finish what you have begun. Listen closely, and see if I lie.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Respond, I beg you, without contention, and, speaking what is just, pass judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And you will not find iniquity on my tongue, nor will foolishness resound in my throat.</p>
