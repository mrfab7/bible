<chapter book="Proverbs" number="23" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">When you sit to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before you:</verse>
  <verse number="2">And put a knife to your throat, if you be a man given to appetite.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Labor not to be rich: cease from your own wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Will you set your eyes on that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Eat you not the bread of him that has an evil eye, neither desire you his dainty meats:</verse>
  <verse number="7">For as he thinks in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, said he to you; but his heart is not with you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The morsel which you have eaten shall you vomit up, and lose your sweet words.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of your words.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:</verse>
  <verse number="11">For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Apply your heart to instruction, and your ears to the words of knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Withhold not correction from the child: for if you beat him with the rod, he shall not die.</verse>
  <verse number="14">You shall beat him with the rod, and shall deliver his soul from hell.</verse>
  <verse number="15">My son, if your heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Yes, my reins shall rejoice, when your lips speak right things.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Let not your heart envy sinners: but be you in the fear of the LORD all the day long.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For surely there is an end; and your expectation shall not be cut off.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Hear you, my son, and be wise, and guide your heart in the way.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:</verse>
  <verse number="21">For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Listen to your father that begat you, and despise not your mother when she is old.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begets a wise child shall have joy of him.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Your father and your mother shall be glad, and she that bore you shall rejoice.</verse>
  <verse number="26">My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.</verse>
  <verse number="28">She also lies in wait as for a prey, and increases the transgressors among men.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Who has woe? who has sorrow? who has contentions? who has babbling? who has wounds without cause? who has redness of eyes?</verse>
  <verse number="30">They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Look not you on the wine when it is red, when it gives his color in the cup, when it moves itself aright.</verse>
  <verse number="32">At the last it bites like a serpent, and stings like an adder.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Your eyes shall behold strange women, and your heart shall utter perverse things.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Yes, you shall be as he that lies down in the middle of the sea, or as he that lies on the top of a mast.</verse>
  <verse number="35">They have stricken me, shall you say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.</verse>
