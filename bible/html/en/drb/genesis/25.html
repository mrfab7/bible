<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Abraham married another wife, named Cetura:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Who bore to him Zamran, and Jecsan, and Madan, and Madian, and Jesboc, and Sue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Jecsan also begot Saba and Dadan. The children of Dadan were Assurim, and Latusim, and Loomin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But of Madian was born Epha, and Opher, and Henoch, and Abida, and Eldaa: all these were the children of Cetura.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Abraham gave all his possessions to Isaac.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And to the children of the concubines he gave gifts, and separated them from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, to the east country.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the days of Abraham’s life were a hundred and seventy-five years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And decaying he died in a good old age, and having lived a long time, and being full of days: and was gathered to his people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Isaac and Ismael his sons buried him in the double cave, which was situated in the field of Ephron the son of Seor the Hethite, over against Mambre;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Which he had bought of the children of Heth: there was he buried, and Sara his wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And after his death, God blessed Isaac his son, who dwelt by the well named Of the living and seeing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">These are the generations of Ismael the son of Abraham, whom Agar the Egyptian, Sara’s servant, bore unto him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And these are the names of his children according to their calling and generations. The firstborn of Ismael was Nabajoth, then Cedar, and Adbeel, and Mabsam.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Masma, and Duma, and Massa,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Hadar, and Thema, and Jethur, and Naphis, and Cedma.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">These are the sons of Ismael: and these are their names by their castles and towns, twelve princes of their tribes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the years of Ismael’s life were a hundred and thirty-seven, and decaying he died, and was gathered unto his people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he dwelt from Hevila as far as Sur, which looketh towards Egypt, to them that go towards the Assyrians. He died in the presence of all his brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">These also are the generations of Isaac the son of Abraham: Abraham begot Isaac:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Who when he was forty years old, took to wife Rebecca the daughter of Bathuel the Syrian of Mesopotamia, sister to Laban.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Isaac besought the Lord for his wife, because she was barren; and he heard him, and made Rebecca to conceive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But the children struggled in her womb: and she said: If it were to be so with me, what need was there to conceive? And she went to consult the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he answering said: Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be divided out of thy womb, and one people shall overcome the other, and the elder shall serve the younger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And when her time was come to be delivered, behold twins were found in her womb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He that came forth first was red, and hairy like a skin: and his name was called Esau. Immediately the other coming forth, held his brother’s foot in his hand, and therefore he was called Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Isaac was threescore years old when the children were born unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And when they were grown up, Esau became a skillful hunter, and a husbandman, but Jacob a plain man dwelt in tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Isaac loved Esau, because he ate of his hunting: and Rebecca loved Jacob.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Jacob boiled Pottage: to whom Esau, coming faint out of the field,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Said: Give me of this red pottage, for I am exceeding faint. For which reason his name was called Edom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And Jacob said to him: Sell me thy first birthright.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He answered: Lo I die, what will the first birthright avail me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Jacob said: Swear therefore to me. Esau swore to him, and sold his first birthright.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And so taking bread and the pottage of lentils, he ate, and drank, and went his way; making little account of having sold his first birthright.</p>
