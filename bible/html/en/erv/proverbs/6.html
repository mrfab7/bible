<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="6" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbour, if thou hast stricken thy hands for a stranger,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbour; go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">So shall thy poverty come as a robber, and thy want as an armed man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A worthless person, a man of iniquity; he walketh with a froward mouth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he maketh signs with his fingers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth evil continually; he soweth discord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; on a sudden shall he be broken and that without remedy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">There be six things which the LORD hateth; yea, seven which are an abomination unto him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A false witness that uttereth lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My son, keep the commandment of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Bind them continually upon thine heart, tie them about thy neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">When thou walkest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall watch over thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the stranger’s tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For on account of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress hunteth for the precious life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Or can one walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">So he that goeth in to his nieghbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be unpunished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He that committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding: he doeth it that would destroy his own soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Wounds and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For jealousy is the rage of a man; and he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</p>
