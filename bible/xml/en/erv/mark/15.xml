  <verse number="1">And straightway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering saith unto him, Thou sayest.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the chief priests accused him of many things.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse thee of.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But Jesus no more answered anything; insomuch that Pilate marveled.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now at the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And there was one called Barabbas, lying bound with them that had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the multitude went up and began to ask him to do as he was wont to do unto them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</verse>
  <verse number="10">For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Pilate again answered and said unto them, What then shall I do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?</verse>
  <verse number="13">And they cried out again, Crucify him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released unto them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And they clothe him with purple, and plaiting a crown of thorns, they put it on him;</verse>
  <verse number="18">and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</verse>
  <verse number="19">And they smote his head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments. And they lead him out to crucify him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they compel one passing by, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And they crucify him, and part his garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.</verse>
  <verse number="28"></verse>
  <verse number="29">And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,</verse>
  <verse number="30">save thyself, and come down from the cross.</verse>
  <verse number="31">In like manner also the chief priests mocking him among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reproached him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</verse>
  <verse number="35">And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elijah.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And one ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to take him down.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And Jesus uttered a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And when the centurion, which stood by over against him, saw that he so gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And there were also women beholding from afar: among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</verse>
  <verse number="41">who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him; and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And when even was now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</verse>
  <verse number="43">there came Joseph of Arimathaea, a councillor of honourable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God; and he boldly went in unto Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And Pilate marveled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And when he learned it of the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And he bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.</verse>
