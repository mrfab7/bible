<chapter book="Ecclesiastes" number="3" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">For everything there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven:</verse>
  <verse number="2">a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</verse>
  <verse number="3">a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</verse>
  <verse number="4">a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</verse>
  <verse number="5">a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</verse>
  <verse number="6">a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</verse>
  <verse number="7">a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</verse>
  <verse number="8">a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.</verse>
  <verse number="9">What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboreth?</verse>
  <verse number="10">I have seen the travail which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised therewith.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He hath made everything beautiful in its time: also he hath set eternity in their heart, yet so that man cannot find out the work that God hath done from the beginning even to the end.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I know that there is nothing better for them, than to rejoice, and to do good so long as they live.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labor, is the gift of God.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor anything taken from it; and God hath done it, that men should fear before him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">That which is hath been long ago; and that which is to be hath long ago been: and God seeketh again that which is passed away.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And moreover I saw under the sun, in the place of justice, that wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, that wickedness was there.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I said in my heart, It is because of the sons of men, that God may prove them, and that they may see that they themselves are but as beasts.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; and man hath no preeminence above the beasts: for all is vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="20">All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Who knoweth the spirit of man, whether it goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast, whether it goeth downward to the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="22">Wherefore I saw that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him back to see what shall be after him?</verse>
