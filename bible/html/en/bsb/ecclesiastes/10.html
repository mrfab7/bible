<div class="chapter" data-book="Ecclesiastes" data-chapter="10" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">As dead flies bring a stench to the perfumer’s oil, so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A wise man’s heart inclines to the right, but the heart of a fool to the left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Even as the fool walks along the road, his sense is lacking, and he shows everyone that he is a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If the ruler’s temper flares against you, do not abandon your post, for calmness lays great offenses to rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">There is an evil I have seen under the sun—an error that proceeds from the ruler:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Folly is appointed to great heights, but the rich sit in lowly positions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I have seen slaves on horseback, while princes go on foot like slaves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He who digs a pit may fall into it, and he who breaches a wall may be bitten by a snake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The one who quarries stones may be injured by them, and he who splits logs endangers himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If the axe is dull and the blade unsharpened, more strength must be exerted, but skill produces success.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If the snake bites before it is charmed, there is no profit for the charmer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The words of a wise man’s mouth are gracious, but the lips of a fool consume him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The beginning of his talk is folly, and the end of his speech is evil madness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Yet the fool multiplies words. No one knows what is coming, and who can tell him what will come after him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The toil of a fool wearies him, for he does not know the way to the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Woe to you, O land whose king is a youth, and whose princes feast in the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Blessed are you, O land whose king is a son of nobles, and whose princes feast at the proper time—for strength and not for drunkenness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Through laziness the roof caves in, and in the hands of the idle, the house leaks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A feast is prepared for laughter, and wine makes life merry, but money is the answer for everything.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Do not curse the king even in your thoughts, or curse the rich even in your bedroom, for a bird of the air may carry your words, and a winged creature may report your speech.</p>
