<div class="chapter" data-book="Philippians" data-chapter="4" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And so, my most beloved and most desired brothers, my joy and my crown: stand firm in this way, in the Lord, most beloved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I ask Euodia, and I beg Syntyche, to have the same understanding in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I also ask you, as my genuine companion, to assist those women who have labored with me in the Gospel, with Clement and the rest of my assistants, whose names are in the Book of Life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Rejoice in the Lord always. Again, I say, rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Let your modesty be known to all men. The Lord is near.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Be anxious about nothing. But in all things, with prayer and supplication, with acts of thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And so shall the peace of God, which exceeds all understanding, guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Concerning the rest, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is chaste, whatever is just, whatever is holy, whatever is worthy to be loved, whatever is of good repute, if there is any virtue, if there is any praiseworthy discipline: meditate on these.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">All the things that you have learned and accepted and heard and seen in me, do these. And so shall the God of peace be with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Now I rejoice in the Lord exceedingly, because finally, after some time, your feelings for me have flourished again, just as you formerly felt. For you had been preoccupied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I am not saying this as if out of need. For I have learned that, in whatever state I am, it is sufficient.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I know how to be humbled, and I know how to abound. I am prepared for anything, anywhere: either to be full or to be hungry, either to have abundance or to endure scarcity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Everything is possible in him who has strengthened me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Yet truly, you have done well by sharing in my tribulation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But you also know, O Philippians, that at the beginning of the Gospel, when I set out from Macedonia, not a single church shared with me in the plan of giving and receiving, except you alone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For you even sent to Thessalonica, once, and then a second time, for what was useful to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">It is not that I am seeking a gift. Instead, I seek the fruit that abounds to your benefit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But I have everything in abundance. I have been filled up, having received from Epaphroditus the things that you sent; this is an odor of sweetness, an acceptable sacrifice, pleasing to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And may my God fulfill all your desires, according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And to God our Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Greet every saint in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The brothers who are with me greet you. All the saints greet you, but especially those who are of Caesarâ€™s household.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
