<p class="verse" data-verse="1">AND after five days the high priest Ananias came down, with some of the ancients, and one Tertullus an orator, who went to the governor against Paul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Paul being called for, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying: Whereas through thee we live in much peace, and many things are rectified by thy providence,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">We accept it always and in all places, most excellent Felix, with all thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But that I be no further tedious to thee, I desire thee of thy clemency to hear us in few words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">We have found this to be a pestilent man, and raising seditions among all the Jews throughout the world, and author of the sedition of the sect of the Nazarenes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom, we having apprehended, would also have judged according to our law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But Lysias the tribune coming upon us, with great violence took him away out of our hands;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Commanding his accusers to come to thee: of whom thou mayest thyself, by examination, have knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the Jews also added, and said that these things were so.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then Paul answered, (the governor making a sign to him to speak:) Knowing that for many years thou hast been judge over this nation, I will with good courage answer for myself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days, since I went up to adore in Jerusalem:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And neither in the temple did they find me disputing with any man, or causing any concourse of the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Neither can they prove unto thee the things whereof they now accuse me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But this I confess to thee, that according to the way, which they call a heresy, so do I serve the Father and my God, believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Having hope in God, which these also themselves look for, that there shall be a resurrection of the just and unjust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And herein do I endeavour to have always a conscience without offence toward God, and towards men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Now after many years, I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings, and vows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">In which I was found purified in the temple: neither with multitude, nor with tumult.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But certain Jews of Asia, who ought to be present before thee, and to accuse, if they had any thing against me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Or let these men themselves say, if they found in me any iniquity, when standing before the council,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Except it be for this one voice only that I cried, standing among them, Concerning the resurrection of the dead am I judged this day by you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Felix put them off, having most certain knowledge of this way, saying: When Lysias the tribune shall come down, I will hear you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he commanded a centurion to keep him, and that he should be easy, and that he should not prohibit any of his friends to minister unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And after some days, Felix, coming with Drusilla his wife, who was a Jew, sent for Paul, and heard of him the faith, that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And as he treated of justice, and chastity, and of the judgment to come, Felix being terrified, answered: For this time, go thy way: but when I have a convenient time, I will send for thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Hoping also withal, that money should be given him by Paul; for which cause also oftentimes sending for him, he spoke with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">But when two years were ended, Felix had for successor Portius Festus. And Felix being willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</p>
