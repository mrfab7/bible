<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Jesus was carried up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted of the devil:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he hungered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the tempter coming up to him said, If thou be Son of God, speak, that these stones may become loaves of bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But he answering said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which goes out through God’s mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then the devil takes him to the holy city, and sets him upon the edge of the temple,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and says to him, If thou be Son of God cast thyself down; for it is written, He shall give charge to his angels concerning thee, and on [their] hands shall they bear thee, lest in anywise thou strike thy foot against a stone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Jesus said to him, It is again written, Thou shalt not tempt [the] Lord thy God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Again the devil takes him to a very high mountain, and shews him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and says to him, All these things will I give thee if, falling down, thou wilt do me homage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then says Jesus to him, Get thee away, Satan, for it is written, Thou shalt do homage to [the] Lord thy God, and him alone shalt thou serve.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Then the devil leaves him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But having heard that John was delivered up, he departed into Galilee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and having left Nazareth, he went and dwelt at Capernaum, which is on the sea-side in the borders of Zabulon and Nepthalim,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">that that might be fulfilled which was spoken through Esaias the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Land of Zabulon and land of Nepthalim, way of [the] sea beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">—the people sitting in darkness has seen a great light, and to those sitting in [the] country and shadow of death, to them has light sprung up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">From that time began Jesus to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and he says to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And they, having left their trawl-nets, immediately followed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And going on thence he saw other two brothers, James the [son] of Zebedee and John his brother, in the ship with Zebedee their father, mending their trawl-nets, and he called them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">and they, having left the ship and their father, immediately followed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And [Jesus] went round the whole [of] Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every bodily weakness among the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And his fame went out into the whole [of] Syria, and they brought to him all that were ill, suffering under various diseases and pains, and those possessed by demons, and lunatics, and paralytics; and he healed them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And great crowds followed him from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judaea, and beyond the Jordan.</p>
