<chapter book="1 Kings" number="5" translation="Webster Bible Translation" translationID="wbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thou knowest how that David my father could not build a house to the name of the LORD his God, for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And behold, I purpose to build a house to the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke to David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build a house to my name.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now therefore command thou, that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and to thee will I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that is skilled in hewing timber like the Sidonians.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, who hath given to David a wise son over this great people.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which thou sentest to me for: and I will perform all thy desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.</verse>
  <verse number="9">My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats to the place that thou shalt appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.</verse>
  <verse number="10">So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he sent them to Lebanon ten thousand a month by courses; a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home. And Adoniram was over the levy.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Solomon had seventy thousand that bore burdens, and eighty thousand hewers in the mountains;</verse>
  <verse number="16">Besides the chief of Solomon’s officers who were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, who ruled over the people that wrought in the work.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Solomon’s builders, and Hiram’s builders did hew them, and the stone-squarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.</verse>
