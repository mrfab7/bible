<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them: Ye shall be holy; for I the LORD your God am holy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and ye shall keep My sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Turn ye not unto the idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And when ye offer a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it that ye may be accepted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow; and if aught remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is a vile thing; it shall not be accepted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the holy thing of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from his people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corner of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the fallen fruit of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and for the stranger: I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Ye shall not steal; neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And ye shall not swear by My name falsely, so that thou profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Thou shalt not oppress thy neighbour, nor rob him; the wages of a hired servant shall not abide with thee all night until the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling-block before the blind, but thou shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment; thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor favour the person of the mighty; but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy people; neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbour: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart; thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbour, and not bear sin because of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Ye shall keep My statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind; thou shalt not sow thy field with two kinds of seed; neither shall there come upon thee a garment of two kinds of stuff mingled together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, designated for a man, and not at all redeemed, nor was freedom given her; there shall be inquisition; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And he shall bring his forfeit unto the LORD, unto the door of the tent of meeting, even a ram for a guilt-offering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt-offering before the LORD for his sin which he hath sinned; and he shall be forgiven for his sin which he hath sinned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as forbidden; three years shall it be as forbidden unto you; it shall not be eaten.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy, for giving praise unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But in the fifth year may ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you more richly the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Ye shall not eat with the blood; neither shall ye practise divination nor soothsaying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor imprint any marks upon you: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Profane not thy daughter, to make her a harlot, lest the land fall into harlotry, and the land become full of lewdness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Ye shall keep My sabbaths, and reverence My sanctuary: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Turn ye not unto the ghosts, nor unto familiar spirits; seek them not out, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and thou shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not do him wrong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">The stranger that sojourneth with you shall be unto you as the home-born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And ye shall observe all My statutes, and all Mine ordinances, and do them: I am the LORD.</p>
