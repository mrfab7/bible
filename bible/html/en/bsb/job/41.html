<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="41" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“Can you pull in Leviathan with a hook or tie down his tongue with a rope?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Will he beg you for mercy or speak to you softly?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Will he make a covenant with you to take him as a slave for life?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Can you pet him like a bird or put him on a leash for your maidens?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Will traders barter for him or divide him among the merchants?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">If you lay a hand on him, you will remember the battle and never repeat it!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Surely hope of overcoming him is false. Is not the sight of him overwhelming?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">No one is so fierce as to rouse Leviathan. Then who is able to stand against Me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Who has given to Me that I should repay him? Everything under heaven is Mine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I cannot keep silent about his limbs, his power and graceful form.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who can strip off his outer coat? Who can approach him with a bridle?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Who can open his jaws, ringed by his fearsome teeth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">His rows of scales are his pride, tightly sealed together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">One scale is so near to another that no air can pass between them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">They are joined to one another; they clasp and cannot be separated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">His snorting flashes with light, and his eyes are like the rays of dawn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Firebrands stream from his mouth; fiery sparks shoot forth!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Smoke billows from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over burning reeds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His breath sets coals ablaze, and flames pour from his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Strength resides in his neck, and dismay leaps before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The folds of his flesh are tightly joined; they are firm and immovable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">His chest is as hard as a rock, as hard as a lower millstone!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">When Leviathan rises up, the mighty are terrified; they withdraw before his thrashing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The sword that reaches him has no effect, nor does the spear or dart or arrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He regards iron as straw and bronze as rotten wood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">No arrow can make him flee; slingstones become like chaff to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">A club is regarded as straw, and he laughs at the sound of the lance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">His undersides are jagged potsherds, spreading out the mud like a threshing sledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">He makes the depths seethe like a cauldron; he makes the sea like a jar of ointment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He leaves a glistening wake behind him; one would think the deep had white hair!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Nothing on earth is his equal—a creature devoid of fear!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">He looks down on all the haughty; he is king over all the proud.”</p>
