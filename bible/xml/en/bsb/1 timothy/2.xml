<chapter book="1 Timothy" number="2" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">First of all, then, I urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgiving be offered for everyone—</verse>
  <verse number="2">for kings and all those in authority—so that we may lead tranquil and quiet lives in all godliness and dignity.</verse>
  <verse number="3">This is good and pleasing in the sight of God our Savior,</verse>
  <verse number="4">who wants everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="6">who gave Himself as a ransom for all—the testimony that was given at just the right time.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For this reason I was appointed as a preacher, an apostle, and a faithful and true teacher of the Gentiles. I am telling the truth; I am not lying about anything.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Therefore I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger or dissension.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Likewise, I want the women to adorn themselves with respectable apparel, with modesty, and with self-control, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes,</verse>
  <verse number="10">but with good deeds, as is proper for women who profess to worship God.</verse>
  <verse number="11">A woman must learn in quietness and full submissiveness.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; she is to remain quiet.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For Adam was formed first, and then Eve.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And it was not Adam who was deceived, but the woman who was deceived and fell into transgression.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Women, however, will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control.</verse>
