<p class="verse" data-verse="1">What then shall we say? Shall we continue in sin, that grace might abound.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">It may not be. We who died to sin, shall we yet live in it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Or know ye not, that as many of us as were immersed in Christ Jesus, we were immersed into his death?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Therefore were we buried with him by immersion into death: that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so also we should walk in newness of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For if grown together we have been in the likeness of his death, but also shall we be of the resurrection:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Knowing this, that our old man was crucified together, that the body of sin might be left inactive, for us no more to serve sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For he having died was justified from sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And if we died with Christ, we believe we shall also live with him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Knowing that Christ, raised from the dead, dies no more; death has no more power over him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For he who died, died to sin once: but he who lives, lives to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">So also ye reckon yourselves truly to be dead to sin, and living to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Therefore let not sin reign in your mortal body, to listen to it in its passions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Neither present ye your members weapons of injustice to sin: but present yourselves to God, as living from the dead, and your members weapons of justice to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For sin shall not rule over you: for ye are not under law, but under grace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">What then? shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under grace It may not be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Know ye not, that to whom ye present yourselves servants for obedience, ye are servants to whom ye listen; either of sin to death, or of obedience to justice?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And grace to God, that ye were servants of sin, but ye listened from the heart to the type of teaching in which ye were delivered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And freed from sin, ye were subdued to justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">(I speak as man through the weakness of your flesh:) for as ye presented your members to uncleanness and iniquity; so now present ye your members servants to justice for consecration.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For when ye were servants to sin, ye were free to justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Therefore what fruit had ye then of what ye are now ashamed? for the end of these, death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And now freed from sin, and subdued to God, ye have your fruit to consecration, and the end life eternal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For the purchasing the provisions of sin, death; and the grace of God, life eternal in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
