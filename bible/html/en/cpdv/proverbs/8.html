<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Does not wisdom call out, and prudence bestow her voice?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">At the summits and the tops of exalted places, standing above the ways, in the midst of the paths,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">beside the gates of the city, at the very doors, she speaks, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">“O men, to you I call out, and my voice is to the sons of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">O little ones, understand discernment. And you who are unwise, turn your souls.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Listen, for I will speak about great things, and my lips will be opened, so as to foretell what is right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">My throat shall practice truth, and my lips shall detest the impious.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">All my words are just. There is no depravity in them, and no perversity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They are upright to those who understand, and equitable to those who discover knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Accept my discipline, and not money. Choose the doctrine that is greater than gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For wisdom is better than all that is most precious, and everything that is desirable cannot compare to her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I, wisdom, dwell in counsel, and I am inside learned thoughts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The fear of the Lord hates evil. I detest arrogance, and pride, and every wicked way, and a mouth with a double tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Counsel is mine, and equity. Prudence is mine. Strength is mine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Through me, kings reign and legislators decree just conditions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Through me, princes rule and the powerful decree justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I love those who love me. And those who stand watch for me until morning shall discover me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">With me, are wealth and glory, superb riches and justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For my fruit is better than gold and precious stones, and my progeny better than choice silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I walk in the way of justice, in the midst of the paths of judgment,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">so that I may enrich those who love me, and thus complete their treasures.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways, before he made anything, from the beginning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">I was ordained from eternity, and out of antiquity, before the earth was formed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The abyss did not yet exist, and I was already conceived; neither had the fountains of waters yet erupted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The mountains, with their great mass, had not yet been established. Before the hills, I was brought forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Still he had not made the earth, and the rivers, and the poles of the globe of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">I was already present: when he prepared the heavens; when, with a certain law and a circuit, he fortified the abyss;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">when he made firm the sky above, and set free the fountains of waters;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">when he encompassed the sea within its limits, and laid down a law for the waters, lest they transgress their limits; when he weighed the foundations of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">I was with him in composing all things. And I was delighted, throughout every day, by playing in his sight at all times,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">playing in globe of the earth. And my delight was to be with the sons of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Therefore, sons, hear me now. Blessed are those who preserve my ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Listen to discipline, and become wise, and do not be willing to cast it aside.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Blessed is the man who listens to me, and who stands watch at my gates everyday, and who observes at the posts of my doors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">He who finds me, finds life, and he will draw salvation from the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">But he who sins against me will wound his own soul. All who hate me love death.”</p>
