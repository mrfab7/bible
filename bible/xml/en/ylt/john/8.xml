  <verse number="1">And at dawn he came again to the temple,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and all the people were coming unto him, and having sat down, he was teaching them;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and the scribes and the Pharisees bring unto him a woman having been taken in adultery, and having set her in the midst,</verse>
  <verse number="4">they say to him, ‘Teacher, this woman was taken in the very crime—committing adultery,</verse>
  <verse number="5">and in the law, Moses did command us that such be stoned; thou, therefore, what dost thou say?’</verse>
  <verse number="6">and this they said, trying him, that they might have to accuse him. And Jesus, having stooped down, with the finger he was writing on the ground,</verse>
  <verse number="7">and when they continued asking him, having bent himself back, he said unto them, ‘The sinless of you—let him first cast the stone at her;’</verse>
  <verse number="8">and again having stooped down, he was writing on the ground,</verse>
  <verse number="9">and they having heard, and by the conscience being convicted, were going forth one by one, having begun from the elders—unto the last; and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Jesus having bent himself back, and having seen no one but the woman, said to her, ‘Woman, where are those—thine accusers? did no one pass sentence upon thee?’</verse>
  <verse number="11">and she said, ‘No one, Sir;’ and Jesus said to her, ‘Neither do I pass sentence on thee; be going on, and no more sin.’</verse>
  <verse number="12">Again, therefore, Jesus spake to them, saying, ‘I am the light of the world; he who is following me shall not walk in the darkness, but he shall have the light of the life.’</verse>
  <verse number="13">The Pharisees, therefore, said to him, ‘Thou of thyself dost testify, thy testimony is not true;’</verse>
  <verse number="14">Jesus answered and said to them, ‘And if I testify of myself—my testimony is true, because I have known whence I came, and whither I go, and ye—ye have not known whence I come, or whither I go.</verse>
  <verse number="15">‘Ye according to the flesh do judge; I do not judge any one,</verse>
  <verse number="16">and even if I do judge my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father who sent me;</verse>
  <verse number="17">and also in your law it hath been written, that the testimony of two men are true;</verse>
  <verse number="18">I am one who is testifying of myself, and the Father who sent me doth testify of me.’</verse>
  <verse number="19">They said, therefore, to him, ‘Where is thy father?’ Jesus answered, ‘Ye have neither known me nor my Father: if me ye had known, my Father also ye had known.’</verse>
  <verse number="20">These sayings spake Jesus in the treasury, teaching in the temple, and no one seized him, because his hour had not yet come;</verse>
  <verse number="21">therefore said Jesus again to them, ‘I go away, and ye will seek me, and in your sin ye shall die; whither I go away, ye are not able to come.’</verse>
  <verse number="22">The Jews, therefore, said, ‘Will he kill himself, because he saith, Whither I go away, ye are not able to come?’</verse>
  <verse number="23">and he said to them, ‘Ye are from beneath, I am from above; ye are of this world, I am not of this world;</verse>
  <verse number="24">I said, therefore, to you, that ye shall die in your sins, for if ye may not believe that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.’</verse>
  <verse number="25">They said, therefore, to him, ‘Thou—who art thou?’ and Jesus said to them, ‘Even what I did speak of to you at the beginning;</verse>
  <verse number="26">many things I have to speak concerning you and to judge, but He who sent me is true, and I—what things I heard from Him—these I say to the world.’</verse>
  <verse number="27">They knew not that of the Father he spake to them;</verse>
  <verse number="28">Jesus, therefore, said to them, ‘When ye may lift up the Son of Man then ye will know that I am he; and of myself I do nothing, but according as my Father did teach me, these things I speak;</verse>
  <verse number="29">and He who sent me is with me; the Father did not leave me alone, because I, the things pleasing to Him, do always.’</verse>
  <verse number="30">As he is speaking these things, many believed in him;</verse>
  <verse number="31">Jesus, therefore, said unto the Jews who believed in him, ‘If ye may remain in my word, truly my disciples ye are, and ye shall know the truth,</verse>
  <verse number="32">and the truth shall make you free.’</verse>
  <verse number="33">They answered him, ‘Seed of Abraham we are; and to no one have we been servants at any time; how dost thou say—Ye shall become free?’</verse>
  <verse number="34">Jesus answered them, ‘Verily, verily, I say to you—Every one who is committing sin, is a servant of the sin,</verse>
  <verse number="35">and the servant doth not remain in the house—to the age, the son doth remain—to the age;</verse>
  <verse number="36">if then the son may make you free, in reality ye shall be free.</verse>
  <verse number="37">‘I have known that ye are seed of Abraham, but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you;</verse>
  <verse number="38">I—that which I have seen with my Father do speak, and ye, therefore, that which ye have seen with your father—ye do.’</verse>
  <verse number="39">They answered and said to him, ‘Our father is Abraham;’ Jesus saith to them, ‘If children of Abraham ye were, the works of Abraham ye were doing;</verse>
  <verse number="40">and now, ye seek to kill me—a man who hath spoken to you the truth I heard from God; this Abraham did not;</verse>
  <verse number="41">ye do the works of your father.’ They said, therefore, to him, ‘We of whoredom have not been born; one Father we have—God;’</verse>
  <verse number="42">Jesus then said to them, ‘If God were your father, ye were loving me, for I came forth from God, and am come; for neither have I come of myself, but He sent me;</verse>
  <verse number="43">wherefore do ye not know my speech? because ye are not able to hear my word.</verse>
  <verse number="44">‘Ye are of a father—the devil, and the desires of your father ye will to do; he was a man-slayer from the beginning, and in the truth he hath not stood, because there is no truth in him; when one may speak the falsehood, of his own he speaketh, because he is a liar—also his father.</verse>
  <verse number="45">‘And because I say the truth, ye do not believe me.</verse>
  <verse number="46">Who of you doth convict me of sin? and if I speak truth, wherefore do ye not believe me?</verse>
  <verse number="47">he who is of God, the sayings of God he doth hear; because of this ye do not hear, because of God ye are not.’</verse>
  <verse number="48">The Jews, therefore, answered and said to him, ‘Do we not say well, that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a demon?’</verse>
  <verse number="49">Jesus answered, ‘I have not a demon, but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me;</verse>
  <verse number="50">and I do not seek my own glory; there is who is seeking and is judging;</verse>
  <verse number="51">verily, verily, I say to you, If any one may keep my word, death he may not see—to the age.’</verse>
  <verse number="52">The Jews, therefore, said to him, ‘Now we have known that thou hast a demon; Abraham did die, and the prophets, and thou dost say, If any one may keep my word, he shall not taste of death—to the age!</verse>
  <verse number="53">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who died? and the prophets died; whom dost thou make thyself?’</verse>
  <verse number="54">Jesus answered, ‘If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing; it is my Father who is glorifying me, of whom ye say that He is your God;</verse>
  <verse number="55">and ye have not known Him, and I have known Him, and if I say that I have not known Him, I shall be like you—speaking falsely; but I have known Him, and His word I keep;</verse>
  <verse number="56">Abraham, your father, was glad that he might see my day; and he saw, and did rejoice.’</verse>
  <verse number="57">The Jews, therefore, said unto him, ‘Thou art not yet fifty years old, and Abraham hast thou seen?’</verse>
  <verse number="58">Jesus said to them, ‘Verily, verily, I say to you, Before Abraham’s coming—I am;’</verse>
  <verse number="59">they took up, therefore, stones that they may cast at him, but Jesus hid himself, and went forth out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</verse>
