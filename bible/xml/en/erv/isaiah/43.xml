  <verse number="1">But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed thee; I have called thee by thy name, thou art mine.</verse>
  <verse number="2">When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy saviour; I have given Egypt as thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Since thou hast been precious in my sight, and honourable, and I have loved thee; therefore will I give men for thee, and peoples for thy life.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Fear not; for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west;</verse>
  <verse number="6">I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back; bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the end of the earth;</verse>
  <verse number="7">every one that is called by my name, and whom I have created for my glory; I have formed him; yea, I have made him.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the peoples be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us former things? let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he; before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I have declared, and I have saved, and I have shewed, and there was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and I am God.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Yea, since the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and I will bring down all of them as fugitives, even the Chaldeans, in the ships of their rejoicing.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I am the LORD, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;</verse>
  <verse number="17">which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they lie down together, they shall not rise; they are extinct, they are quenched as flax:</verse>
  <verse number="18">Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Behold, I will do a new thing; now shall it spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The beasts of the field shall honour me, the jackals and the ostriches: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen:</verse>
  <verse number="21">the people which I formed for myself, that they might set forth my praise.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Yet thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not made thee to serve with offerings, nor wearied thee with frankincense.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.</verse>
  <verse number="25">I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake; and I will not remember thy sins.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Put me in remembrance; let us plead together: set thou forth thy cause, that thou mayest be justified.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Thy first father sinned, and thine interpreters have transgressed against me.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary, and I will make Jacob a curse, and Israel a reviling.</verse>
