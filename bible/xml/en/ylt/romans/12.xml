  <verse number="1">I call upon you, therefore, brethren, through the compassions of God, to present your bodies a sacrifice—living, sanctified, acceptable to God—your intelligent service;</verse>
  <verse number="2">and be not conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, for your proving what is the will of God—the good, and acceptable, and perfect.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For I say, through the grace that was given to me, to every one who is among you, not to think above what it behoveth to think; but to think so as to think wisely, as to each God did deal a measure of faith,</verse>
  <verse number="4">for as in one body we have many members, and all the members have not the same office,</verse>
  <verse number="5">so we, the many, one body are in Christ, and members each one of one another.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And having gifts, different according to the grace that was given to us; whether prophecy—‘According to the proportion of faith!’</verse>
  <verse number="7">or ministration—‘In the ministration!’ or he who is teaching—‘In the teaching!’</verse>
  <verse number="8">or he who is exhorting—‘In the exhortation!’ he who is sharing—‘In simplicity!’ he who is leading—‘In diligence?’ he who is doing kindness—‘In cheerfulness.’</verse>
  <verse number="9">The love unfeigned: abhorring the evil; cleaving to the good;</verse>
  <verse number="10">in the love of brethren, to one another kindly affectioned: in the honour going before one another;</verse>
  <verse number="11">in the diligence not slothful; in the spirit fervent; the Lord serving;</verse>
  <verse number="12">in the hope rejoicing; in the tribulation enduring; in the prayer persevering;</verse>
  <verse number="13">to the necessities of the saints communicating; the hospitality pursuing.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Bless those persecuting you; bless, and curse not;</verse>
  <verse number="15">to rejoice with the rejoicing, and to weep with the weeping,</verse>
  <verse number="16">of the same mind one toward another, not minding the high things, but with the lowly going along; become not wise in your own conceit;</verse>
  <verse number="17">giving back to no one evil for evil; providing right things before all men.</verse>
  <verse number="18">If possible—so far as in you—with all men being in peace;</verse>
  <verse number="19">not avenging yourselves, beloved, but give place to the wrath, for it hath been written, ‘Vengeance is Mine,</verse>
  <verse number="20">I will recompense again, saith the Lord;’ if, then, thine enemy doth hunger, feed him; if he doth thirst, give him drink; for this doing, coals of fire thou shalt heap upon his head;</verse>
  <verse number="21">Be not overcome by the evil, but overcome, in the good, the evil.</verse>
