<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“How long will you torment me and crush me with your words?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Ten times now you have reproached me; you shamelessly mistreat me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Even if I have truly gone astray, my error concerns me alone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my disgrace against me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">then understand that it is God who has wronged me and drawn His net around me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Though I cry out, ‘Violence!’ I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; He has veiled my paths with darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He tears me down on every side until I am gone; He uproots my hope like a tree.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">His anger burns against me, and He counts me among His enemies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">His troops advance together; they construct a ramp against me and encamp around my tent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He has removed my brothers from me; my acquaintances have abandoned me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">My kinsmen have failed me, and my friends have forgotten me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">My guests and maidservants count me as a stranger; I am a foreigner in their sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I call for my servant, but he does not answer, though I implore him with my own mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">My breath is repulsive to my wife, and I am loathsome to my own family.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Even little boys scorn me; when I appear, they deride me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">All my best friends despise me, and those I love have turned against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My skin and flesh cling to my bones; I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Why do you persecute me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">I wish that my words were recorded and inscribed in a book,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">by an iron stylus on lead, or chiseled in stone forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But I know that my Redeemer lives, and in the end He will stand upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Even after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">I will see Him for myself; my eyes will behold Him, and not as a stranger. How my heart yearns within me!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">If you say, ‘Let us persecute him, since the root of the matter lies with him,’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">then you should fear the sword yourselves, because wrath brings punishment by the sword, so that you may know there is a judgment.”</p>
