  <verse number="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?</verse>
  <verse number="3">[Is it] any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or [is it] gain [to him], that thou makest thy ways perfect?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?</verse>
  <verse number="5">[Is] not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?</verse>
  <verse number="6">For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But [as for] the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore snares [are] round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;</verse>
  <verse number="11">Or darkness, [that] thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.</verse>
  <verse number="12">[Is] not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!</verse>
  <verse number="13">And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thick clouds [are] a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?</verse>
  <verse number="16">Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:</verse>
  <verse number="17">Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Yet he filled their houses with good [things]: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The righteous see [it], and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the [gold] of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.</verse>
  <verse number="29">When [men] are cast down, then thou shalt say, [There is] lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.</verse>
  <verse number="30">He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.</verse>
