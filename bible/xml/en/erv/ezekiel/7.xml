  <verse number="1">Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel, An end: the end is come upon the four corners of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Now is the end upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity: but I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thus saith the Lord GOD: An evil, an only evil; behold, it cometh.</verse>
  <verse number="6">An end is come, the end is come, it awaketh against thee; behold, it cometh.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thy doom is come unto thee, O inhabitant of the land: the time is come, the day is near; a day of tumult, and not of joyful shouting, upon the mountains.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger against thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways; and I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will bring upon thee according to thy ways, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I the LORD do smite.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Behold, the day, behold, it cometh: thy doom is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth: neither shall there be eminency among them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they be yet alive: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof, none shall return; neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.</verse>
  <verse number="14">They have blown the trumpet, and have made all ready; but none goeth to the battle: for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die with the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one in his iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="17">All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.</verse>
  <verse number="18">They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.</verse>
  <verse number="19">They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an unclean thing; their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the LORD; they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their bowels: because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="20">As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty: but they made the images of their abominations and their detestable things therein: therefore have I made it unto them as an unclean thing.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it.</verse>
  <verse number="22">My face will I turn also from them, and they shall profane my secret place: and robbers shall enter into it, and profane it.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Make the chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses: I will also make the pride of the strong to cease; and their holy places shall be profaned.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; and they shall seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.</verse>
  <verse number="27">The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
