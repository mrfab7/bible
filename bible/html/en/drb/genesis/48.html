<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After these things, it was told Joseph that his father was sick: and he set out to go to him, taking his two sons Manasses and Ephraim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it was told the old man: Behold I thy son Joseph cometh to thee. And being strengthened he sat on his bed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And when Joseph was come in to him, he said : God Almighty appeared to me at Lute, which is in the land of Chanaan: and he blessed me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he said : I will cause thee to increase and multiply, and I will make of thee a multitude of people: and I will give this land to thee, and to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">So thy two sons who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came hither to thee, shall be mine: Ephraim and Manasses shall be reputed to me as Ruben and Simeon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But the rest whom thou shalt have after them, shall be thine, and shall be called by the name of their brethren in their possessions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For, when I came out of Mesopotamia, Rachel died from me in the land of Ohanaan in the very journey, and it was springtime: and I was going to Ephrata, and I buried her near the way of Ephrata, which by another name is called Bethlehem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then seeing his sons, he said to him: Who are these?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He answered: They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said: Bring them to me that I may bless them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For Israel’s eyes were dim by reason of his great age, and he could not see clearly. And when they were brought to him, he kissed and embraced them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And said to his son: I am not deprived of seeing thee: moreover God hath shewed me thy seed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And when Joseph had taken them from his father’s lap, he bowed down with his face to the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And he set Ephraim on his right bend, that is, towards the left hand of Israel; but Manasses on his left hand, to wit, towards his father’s right hand, and brought them near to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But he stretching forth his right hand, put it upon the head of Ephraim the younger brother; and the left upon the head of Manasses who was the elder, changing his hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Jacob blessed the sons of Joseph, and said: God, in whose sight my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, God that feedeth me from my youth until this day;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The angel that delivereth me from all evils, bless these boys: and let my name be called upon them, and the names of my fathers Abraham, and Isaac, and may they grow into a multitude upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Joseph seeing that his father had put his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, was much displeased: and taking his father’s hand he tried to lift it from Ephraims head, and to remove it to the head of Manasses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he said to his father: It should not be so, my father: for this is the first- born, put thy right hand upon his head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But he refusing, said: I know, my son, I know: and this also shall become peoples, and shall be multiplied: but this younger brother shall be greater than he: and his seed shall grow into nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And he blessed them at that time, saying: In thee shall Israel be blessed, and it shall be said: God do to thee as to Ephraim, and as to Manasses. And he set Ephraim before Manasses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And he said to Joseph his son: Be- hold I die, and God will be with you, and will bring you back into the land of your fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">I give thee a portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorrhite a with my sword and bow.</p>
