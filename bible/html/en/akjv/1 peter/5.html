<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Peter" data-chapter="5" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Neither as being lords over Godâ€™s heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Likewise, you younger, submit yourselves to the elder. Yes, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resists the proud, and gives grace to the humble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Casting all your care on him; for he cares for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brothers that are in the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But the God of all grace, who has called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that you have suffered a while, make you perfect, establish, strengthen, settle you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">By Silvanus, a faithful brother to you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein you stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, salutes you; and so does Marcus my son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Greet you one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
