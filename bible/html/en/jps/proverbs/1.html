<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">To know wisdom and instruction; To comprehend the words of understanding;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">To receive the discipline of wisdom, Justice, and right, and equity;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning, And the man of understanding may attain unto wise counsels;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">To understand a proverb, and a figure; The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; But the foolish despise wisdom and discipline.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, And forsake not the teaching of thy mother;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, And chains about thy neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">My son, if sinners entice thee, Consent thou not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If they say: ‘Come with us, Let us lie in wait for blood, Let us lurk for the innocent without cause;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let us swallow them up alive as the grave, And whole, as those that go down into the pit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">We shall find all precious substance, We shall fill our houses with spoil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Cast in thy lot among us; Let us all have one purse’—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">My son, walk not thou in the way with them, Restrain thy foot from their path;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For their feet run to evil, And they make haste to shed blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For in vain the net is spread In the eyes of any bird;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And these lie in wait for their own blood, They lurk for their own lives.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; It taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Wisdom crieth aloud in the streets, She uttereth her voice in the broad places;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">She calleth at the head of the noisy streets, At the entrances of the gates, in the city, she uttereth her words:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">How long, ye thoughtless, will ye love thoughtlessness? And how long will scorners delight them in scorning, And fools hate knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Turn you at my reproof; Behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Because I have called, and ye refused, I have stretched out my hand, and no man attended,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But ye have set at nought all my counsel, And would none of my reproof;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I also, in your calamity, will laugh, I will mock when your dread cometh;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">When your dread cometh as a storm, And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; When trouble and distress come upon you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Then will they call me, but I will not answer, They will seek me earnestly, but they shall not find me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For that they hated knowledge, And did not choose the fear of the LORD;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">They would none of my counsel, They despised all my reproof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled with their own devices.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For the waywardness of the thoughtless shall slay them, And the confidence of fools shall destroy them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, And shall be quiet without fear of evil.’</p>
