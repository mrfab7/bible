<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="3" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After this, Job opened his mouth and cursed his day,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and this is what he said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">May the day perish on which I was born, and the night, in which it was said, “A man has been conceived.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">May that day be turned into darkness, may God not seek it from above, and may light not illuminate it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Let darkness and the shadow of death obscure it, let a fog overtake it, and let it be enveloped in bitterness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Let a whirlwind of darkness take hold of that night, let it not be counted in the days of the year, nor numbered in the months.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">May that night be alone and unworthy of praise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">May they curse it, who curse the day, who are prepared to awaken a leviathan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Let the stars be concealed with its darkness. Let it expect light, and not see it, nor the rising of the dawn in the East.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For it did not close the doors of the womb that bore me, nor take away evils from my eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Why did I not die in the womb? Having left the womb, why did I not immediately perish?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Why was I received upon the knees? Why was I suckled at the breasts?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For by now, I should have been sleeping silently, and taking rest in my sleep</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">with the kings and consuls of the earth, who build themselves solitudes,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">either with princes, who possess gold and fill their houses with silver,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">or, like a hidden miscarriage, I should not have continued, just like those who, being conceived, have not seen the light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">There the impious cease from rebellion, and there the wearied in strength take rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And at such times, having been bound together without difficulty, they have not heard the voice of the bailiff.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The small and great are there, and the servant is free from his master.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Why is light given to the miserable, and life to those who are in bitterness of soul,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">who expect death, and it does not arrive, like those who dig for treasure</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">and who rejoice greatly when they have found the grave,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">to a man whose way is hidden and whom God has surrounded with darkness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Before I eat, I sigh; and like overflowing waters, so is my howl,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">for the terror that I feared has happened to me, and so has the dread befallen me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Have I not remained hidden? Have I not kept silence? Have I not remained calm? Yet indignation has overcome me.</p>
