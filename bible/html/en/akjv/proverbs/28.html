<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="28" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The wicked flee when no man pursues: but the righteous are bold as a lion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A poor man that oppresses the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaves no food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Better is the poor that walks in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Whoever keeps the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shames his father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that by usury and unjust gain increases his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He that turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Whoever causes the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in possession.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that has understanding searches him out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He that covers his sins shall not prosper: but whoever confesses and forsakes them shall have mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Happy is the man that fears always: but he that hardens his heart shall fall into mischief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The prince that wants understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hates covetousness shall prolong his days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A man that does violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Whoever walks uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He that tills his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that follows after vain persons shall have poverty enough.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that makes haste to be rich shall not be innocent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He that hastens to be rich has an evil eye, and considers not that poverty shall come on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He that rebukes a man afterwards shall find more favor than he that flatters with the tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Whoever robs his father or his mother, and said, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He that is of a proud heart stirs up strife: but he that puts his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He that trusts in his own heart is a fool: but whoever walks wisely, he shall be delivered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He that gives to the poor shall not lack: but he that hides his eyes shall have many a curse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.</p>
