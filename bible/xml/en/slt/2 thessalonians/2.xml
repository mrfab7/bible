<chapter book="2 Thessalonians" number="2" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And we ask you, brethren, concerning the arrival of our Lord Jesus Christ, and our assembling together to him,</verse>
  <verse number="2">For you not to be quickly shaken in mind, neither be disturbed, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by epistle as by us, as that the day of Christ has drawn near.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Let none deceive you in any manner: for, except an apostasy come first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who being opposed and lifted up above all called God, or which is worshipped; so that he as God sits in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Remember ye not, that, yet being with you, I spake these to you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And now ye know the withholding for him to be revealed in his time.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For the mystery of iniquity is already energetic: only he withholding, even till he be out of the midst.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And then shall the Lawless one be revealed, whom the Lord will destroy with the spirit of his mouth, and leave unemployed in the splendor of his arrival:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Whose arrival is according to the energy of Satan in all power and signs and wonders of falsehood,</verse>
  <verse number="10">And in all deceit of iniquity in the lost; because they received not the love of the truth, for them to be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And for this, God shall send them the energy of error, for them to believe in falsehood:</verse>
  <verse number="12">That all might be judged not believing the truth but contented in iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And we ought to return thanks to God always for you, brethren dearly beloved by the Lord, that God chose you from the beginning to salvation in consecration of the Spirit and belief of the truth:</verse>
  <verse number="14">To which he called you by our good news, to the acquisition of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Therefore, brethren, stand, and hold firmly the doctrines which ye were taught, whether by the word, or by our epistle.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, also our Father, having loved us, and given us eternal consolation and good hope in grace,</verse>
  <verse number="17">Comfort your hearts, and support you in every good word and work.</verse>
