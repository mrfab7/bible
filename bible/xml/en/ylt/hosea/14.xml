  <verse number="3">Asshur doth not save us, on a horse we ride not, Nor do we say any more, Our God, to the work of our hands, For in Thee find mercy doth the fatherless.’</verse>
  <verse number="4">I heal their backsliding, I love them freely, For turned back hath Mine anger from him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I am as dew to Israel, he flourisheth as a lily, And he striketh forth his roots as Lebanon.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Go on do his sucklings, And his beauty is as an olive, And he hath fragrance as Lebanon.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Return do the dwellers under his shadow, They revive as corn, and flourish as a vine, His memorial is as wine of Lebanon.</verse>
  <verse number="8">O Ephraim, what to Me any more with idols? I—I afflicted, and I cause him to sing: ‘I am as a green fir-tree,’ From Me is thy fruit found.</verse>
