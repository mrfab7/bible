<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="3" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son! my law forget not, And my commands let thy heart keep,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For length of days and years, Life and peace they do add to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Let not kindness and truth forsake thee, Bind them on thy neck, Write them on the tablet of thy heart,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And find grace and good understanding In the eyes of God and man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Trust unto Jehovah with all thy heart, And unto thine own understanding lean not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In all thy ways know thou Him, And He doth make straight thy paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Be not wise in thine own eyes, Fear Jehovah, and turn aside from evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Healing it is to thy navel, And moistening to thy bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Honour Jehovah from thy substance, And from the beginning of all thine increase;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And filled are thy barns with plenty, And with new wine thy presses break forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Chastisement of Jehovah, my son, despise not, And be not vexed with His reproof,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For whom Jehovah loveth He reproveth, Even as a father the son He is pleased with.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">O the happiness of a man who hath found wisdom, And of a man who bringeth forth understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For better is her merchandise Than the merchandise of silver, And than gold—her increase.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Precious she is above rubies, And all thy pleasures are not comparable to her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Length of days is in her right hand, In her left are wealth and honour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">A tree of life she is to those laying hold on her, And whoso is retaining her is happy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Jehovah by wisdom did found the earth, He prepared the heavens by understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">By His knowledge depths have been rent, And clouds do drop dew.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">My son! let them not turn from thine eyes, Keep thou wisdom and thoughtfulness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And they are life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Then thou goest thy way confidently, And thy foot doth not stumble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">If thou liest down, thou art not afraid, Yea, thou hast lain down, And sweet hath been thy sleep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Be not afraid of sudden fear, And of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For Jehovah is at thy side, And He hath kept thy foot from capture.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Withhold not good from its owners, When thy hand is toward God to do it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Say not thou to thy friend, ‘Go, and return, and to-morrow I give,’ And substance with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Devise not against thy neighbour evil, And he sitting confidently with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Strive not with a man without cause, If he have not done thee evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Be not envious of a man of violence, Nor fix thou on any of his ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For an abomination to Jehovah is the perverted, And with the upright is His secret counsel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked. And the habitation of the righteous He blesseth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">If the scorners He doth scorn, Yet to the humble He doth give grace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Honour do the wise inherit, And fools are bearing away shame!</p>
