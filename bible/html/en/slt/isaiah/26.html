<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="26" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">In that day this song shall be sung in the land of Judah: A strong city to us; he will set salvation the wall and the fortification.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Open ye the gates and the just nation watching truths shall come in.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The mind placed upon thee thou wilt form peace, peace, because he trusted in thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Trust ye in Jehovah even to eternity, for in Jah Jehovah is the rock of ages.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For he bows down those dwelling in height; for the city set up on high he will bring it down; he will bring it down even to the earth; he will cause it to touch even to the dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The foot shall tread it down, the feet of the humble, the steps of the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The way to the just one is straightness: being upright, thou wilt prepare the departing of the just one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Also the way of thy judgments, O Jehovah, we hoped for thee; to thy name and to thy remembrance is the desire of the soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">My soul desired thee in the night; also my spirit in the midst of me I will seek thee: for when thy judgments to the earth, those dwelling in the habitable globe will learn justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Shall the unjust be shown favor? He learnt not justice; in the land of justice he will act perversely, and he will not see the majesty of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">O Jehovah, high thy hand, they will not see: they shall see and be ashamed for their jealousy of the people; also the fire of thine enemies shall consume them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">O Jehovah, thou wilt judge peace for us: for also all our works thou didst for us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">O Jehovah our God, lords besides thee had dominion over us; but in thee alone will we make mention of thy name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The dead shall not live; shades shall not rise; for this, thou reviewedst and thou wilt destroy them, and all remembrance to them shall perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thou didst add to the nation, O Jehovah, thou didst add to the nation thou wert honored: thou didst put far; away all the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">O Jehovah, in straits they looked after thee; they poured out a whispering thy correction to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">As she conceiving will draw near to bring forth, she will be pained and cry out in her pangs, thus were we from before thee, O Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">We conceived, we were pained, thus we brought forth wind; we shall not make the earth salvation, the inhabitants of the habitable globe shall not fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thy dead shall live, with my corpse shall they rise. Awake and shout, ye dwelling in dust: for the dew of brightness is thy dew, and the land of the shades shall fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Go, my people, enter into thy apartments and shut thy doors about thee: hide thee as a little moment till the wrath shall pass by.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For behold, Jehovah will come forth out of his place to review the iniquity of him dwelling in the earth upon him; and the earth uncovered her bloods, and she will no more cover over her slain.</p>
