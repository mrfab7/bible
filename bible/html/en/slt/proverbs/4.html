<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For I gave to you good instruction; ye shall not forsake my law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I was son to my father; tender and only before the face of my mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he taught me, and he will say to me, Thy heart shall hold fast my words: watch my commands and live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Obtain wisdom, obtain understanding: thou shalt not forget, and thou shalt not decline from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thou shalt not forsake her, and she will watch thee: love her, and she will guard thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wisdom the beginning; obtain wisdom, and with all thine acquisition, obtain understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Lift her up and she shall exalt thee: she will honor thee when thou shalt embrace her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">She will give to thy head a garland of grace: a crown of glory she will deliver thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Hear, my son, and receive my words, and the years of life shall be multiplied to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">In the way of wisdom I taught thee; I caused thee to tread in the tracks of uprightness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">In thy going, thy steps shall not be pressed; and if thou shalt run thou shalt not be weak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Lay hold upon instruction, thou shalt not let go: guard her for she is thy life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">In the path of the unjust thou shalt not go, and thou shalt not advance in the way of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Reject it, thou shalt not pass in it; turn aside from it and pass by.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For they slept not, if they shall not do evil; and their sleep was taken away, if they shall not cause to falter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For they ate the bread of injustice, and they will drink the wine of violences:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The path of the just as the light shining, going and shining even to the day prepared.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The way of the unjust as darkness: they shall not know in what they shall stumble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My son, attend to my word; incline thine ear to my sayings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">They shall not turn aside from thine eyes; watch them in the midst of thy heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For they are life to those finding them, and healing to all their flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Guard thy heart with all watching, for from it the goings forth of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Turn away from thee perverseness of mouth, and frowardness of lips remove far oft from thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Thine eyes shall look straight before, and thine eyelashes shall be right before thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Make level the track of thy feet, and all thy ways shall be prepared.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Thou shalt not decline to the right and the left: turn away thy foot from evil.</p>
