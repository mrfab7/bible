<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Jacob will come near to Isaak his father, and he will feel him, and he will say, The voice, the voice of Jacob; and the hands, the hands of Esau.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he knew him not, for his hands were as the hands of Esau, his brother of hair: and he will praise him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And he will say, Thou this my son Esau? and he will say, I.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And he will say, Bring near to me, and eating of my son’s hunting, so that my soul shall praise thee. And he will bring near to him and he will eat: and he will bring wine to him, and he will drink.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And he will come near, and will kiss him: and he will smell the smell of his garment, and he will bless him, and he will say, See, the smell of my son as the smell of a field which Jehovah praised.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And nations shall serve thee, and peoples shall bow down to thee; be lord over thy brother, and thy mother’s sons shall bow down to thee: cursed he cursing thee, and blessed he praising thee.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And he also will make dainties, and will bring to his father; and he will say to his father, Will my father rise and eat from his son’s hunting, that thy soul shall bless me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And Isaak his father will say to him, Who art thou? And he will say, I thy son, thy first-born, Esau.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And Isaak will tremble a great trembling, even exceedingly; and he will say, Who now is he having hunted a hunting, and will bring to me, and I ate from all before thou wilt come, and I shall praise him? also he shall be praised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">When Esau heard the words of his father, and he will cry out with a great cry, even bitter exceedingly, and he will say to his father, praise me, me also, my father!</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And he will say, Is it not that his name was called Jacob? he will defraud me this twice: he took my birthright and behold, now he took my blessing And he will say, Didst thou not put aside a blessing for me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And Isaak will answer and say to Esau, Behold, I made him mighty over thee, and all his brethren I gave to him for servants; and with corn and new wine I supported him: and what shall I do to thee my son?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And Esau will say to his father, Is but this one blessing to thee my father? bless me, also me, my father! and Esau will lift up the voice and weep.</p>
