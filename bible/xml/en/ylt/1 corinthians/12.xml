<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="12" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And concerning the spiritual things, brethren, I do not wish you to be ignorant;</verse>
  <verse number="2">ye have known that ye were nations, unto the dumb idols—as ye were led—being carried away;</verse>
  <verse number="3">wherefore, I give you to understand that no one, in the Spirit of God speaking, saith Jesus is anathema, and no one is able to say Jesus is Lord, except in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And there are diversities of gifts, and the same Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="5">and there are diversities of ministrations, and the same Lord;</verse>
  <verse number="6">and there are diversities of workings, and it is the same God—who is working the all in all.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And to each hath been given the manifestation of the Spirit for profit;</verse>
  <verse number="8">for to one through the Spirit hath been given a word of wisdom, and to another a word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="9">and to another faith in the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healings in the same Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="10">and to another in-workings of mighty deeds; and to another prophecy; and to another discernings of spirits; and to another divers kinds of tongues; and to another interpretation of tongues:</verse>
  <verse number="11">and all these doth work the one and the same Spirit, dividing to each severally as he intendeth.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For, even as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the one body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ,</verse>
  <verse number="13">for also in one Spirit we all to one body were baptized, whether Jews or Greeks, whether servants or freemen, and all into one Spirit were made to drink,</verse>
  <verse number="14">for also the body is not one member, but many;</verse>
  <verse number="15">if the foot may say, ‘Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body;’ it is not, because of this, not of the body;</verse>
  <verse number="16">and if the ear may say, ‘Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body;’ it is not, because of this, not of the body?</verse>
  <verse number="17">If the whole body were an eye, where the hearing? if the whole hearing, where the smelling?</verse>
  <verse number="18">and now, God did set the members each one of them in the body, according as He willed,</verse>
  <verse number="19">and if all were one member, where the body?</verse>
  <verse number="20">and now, indeed, are many members, and one body;</verse>
  <verse number="21">and an eye is not able to say to the hand, ‘I have no need of thee;’ nor again the head to the feet, ‘I have no need of you.’</verse>
  <verse number="22">But much more the members of the body which seem to be more infirm are necessary,</verse>
  <verse number="23">and those that we think to be less honourable of the body, around these we put more abundant honour, and our unseemly things have seemliness more abundant,</verse>
  <verse number="24">and our seemly things have no need; but God did temper the body together, to the lacking part having given more abundant honour,</verse>
  <verse number="25">that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same anxiety for one another,</verse>
  <verse number="26">and whether one member doth suffer, suffer with it do all the members, or one member is glorified, rejoice with it do all the members;</verse>
  <verse number="27">and ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And some, indeed, did God set in the assembly, first apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers, afterwards powers, afterwards gifts of healings, helpings, governings, divers kinds of tongues;</verse>
  <verse number="29">are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all powers?</verse>
  <verse number="30">have all gifts of healings? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?</verse>
  <verse number="31">and desire earnestly the better gifts; and yet a far excelling way do I shew to you:</verse>
