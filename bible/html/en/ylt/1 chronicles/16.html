<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And they bring in the ark of God, and set it up in the midst of the tent that David hath stretched out for it, and they bring near burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and David ceaseth from offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, and blesseth the people in the name of Jehovah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and giveth a portion to every man of Israel, both man and woman: to each a cake of bread, and a measure of wine, and a grape-cake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he putteth before the ark of Jehovah, of the Levites, ministers, even to make mention of, and to thank, and to give praise to Jehovah, God of Israel,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Asaph the head, and his second Zechariah; Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-Edom, and Jeiel, with instruments of psalteries, and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals is sounding;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests are with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">On that day then hath David given at the beginning to give thanks to Jehovah by the hand of Asaph and his brethren:—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Give thanks to Jehovah, call in His name, Make known among the peoples His doings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Sing ye to Him, sing psalms to Him, Meditate on all His wonders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Boast yourselves in His holy name, Rejoice doth the heart of those seeking Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Seek ye Jehovah and His strength, Seek His face continually.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Remember His wonders that He did, His signs, and the judgments of His mouth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">O seed of Israel, His servant, O sons of Jacob, His chosen ones!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He is Jehovah our God, In all the earth are His judgments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Remember ye to the age His covenant, The word He commanded—To a thousand generations,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Which He hath made with Abraham, And His oath—to Isaac,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And He establisheth it to Jacob for a statute, To Israel—a covenant age-during.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Saying: To thee I give the land of Canaan, The portion of your inheritance,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">When ye are few of number, As a little thing, and sojourners in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And they go up and down, From nation unto nation, And from a kingdom unto another people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He hath not suffered any to oppress them, And reproveth on their account kings:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Come not against Mine anointed ones, And against My prophets do not evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Sing to Jehovah, all the earth, Proclaim from day unto day His salvation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Rehearse among nations His glory, Among all the peoples His wonders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For great is Jehovah, and praised greatly, And fearful He is above all gods.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For all gods of the peoples are nought, And Jehovah the heavens hath made.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Honour and majesty are before Him, Strength and joy are in His place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Ascribe to Jehovah, ye families of peoples, Ascribe to Jehovah honour and strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Ascribe to Jehovah the honour of His name, Lift up a present, and come before Him. Bow yourselves to Jehovah, In the beauty of holiness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Be pained before Him, all the earth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Also, established is the world, It is not moved! The heavens rejoice, and the earth is glad, And they say among nations: Jehovah hath reigned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Roar doth the sea, and its fulness, Exult doth the field, and all that is in it,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Then sing do trees of the forest, From the presence of Jehovah, For He hath come to judge the earth!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Give thanks to Jehovah, for good, For to the age, is His kindness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And say, Save us, O God of our salvation, And gather us, and deliver us from the nations, To give thanks to Thy holy name, To triumph in Thy praise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Blessed is Jehovah, God of Israel, From the age and unto the age;’ And all the people say, ‘Amen,’ and have given praise to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And he leaveth there before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, for Asaph and for his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, according to the matter of a day in its day,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">both Obed-Edom and their brethren, sixty and eight, and Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun, and Hosah for gatekeepers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah, in a high place that is in Gibeon,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">to cause to ascend burnt-offerings to Jehovah, on the altar of burnt-offering continually, morning and evening, and for all that is written in the law of Jehovah, that He charged on Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And with them are Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest of those chosen, who were defined by name, to give thanks to Jehovah, for to the age is His kindness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">and with them—Heman and Jeduthun—are trumpets and cymbals for those sounding, and instruments of the song of God, and the sons of Jeduthun are at the gate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And all the people go, each to his house, and David turneth round to bless his house.</p>
