  <verse number="1">Better is the poor that walks in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.</verse>

  <verse number="5">A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaks lies shall not escape.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Many will entreat the favor of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that gives gifts.</verse>
  <verse number="7">All the brothers of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursues them with words, yet they are wanting to him.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He that gets wisdom loves his own soul: he that keeps understanding shall find good.</verse>
  <verse number="9">A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaks lies shall perish.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The discretion of a man defers his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favor is as dew on the grass.</verse>

  <verse number="16">He that keeps the commandment keeps his own soul; but he that despises his ways shall die.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He that has pity on the poor lends to the LORD; and that which he has given will he pay him again.</verse>

  <verse number="19">A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if you deliver him, yet you must do it again.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that you may be wise in your latter end.</verse>
  <verse number="21">There are many devices in a man’s heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The fear of the LORD tends to life: and he that has it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.</verse>

  <verse number="26">He that wastes his father, and chases away his mother, is a son that causes shame, and brings reproach.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causes to err from the words of knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="28">An ungodly witness scorns judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devours iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.</verse>
