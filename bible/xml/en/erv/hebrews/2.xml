<chapter book="Hebrews" number="2" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things that were heard, lest haply we drift away from them.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For if the word spoken through angels proved stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;</verse>
  <verse number="3">how shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation? which having at the first been spoken through the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard;</verse>
  <verse number="4">God also bearing witness with them, both by signs and wonders, and by manifold powers, and by gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For not unto angels did he subject the world to come, whereof we speak.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But one hath somewhere testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? Or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; Thou crownedst him with glory and honour, And didst set him over the works of thy hands:</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thou didst put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he subjected all things unto him, he left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But we behold him who hath been made a little lower than the angels, even Jesus, because of the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour, that by the grace of God he should taste death for every man.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the author of their salvation perfect through sufferings.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For both he that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</verse>
  <verse number="12">saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, In the midst of the congregation will I sing thy praise.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold, I and the children which God hath given me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Since then the children are sharers in flesh and blood, he also himself in like manner partook of the same; that through death he might bring to nought him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;</verse>
  <verse number="15">and might deliver all them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For verily not of angels doth he take hold, but he taketh hold of the seed of Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to succour them that are tempted.</verse>
