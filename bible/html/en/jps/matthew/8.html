<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Upon descending from the hill country He was followed by immense crowds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And a leper came to Him, and throwing himself at His feet, said, “Sir, if only you are willing you are able to cleanse me.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">So Jesus put out His hand and touched him, and said, “I am willing: be cleansed.” Instantly he was cleansed from his leprosy;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and Jesus said to him, “Be careful to tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses appointed as evidence for them.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">After His entry into Capernaum a Captain came to Him, and entreated Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">“Sir,” he said, “my servant at home is lying ill with paralysis, and is suffering great pain.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">“I will come and cure him,” said Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">“Sir,” replied the Captain, “I am not a fit person to receive you under my roof: merely say the word, and my servant will be cured.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For I myself am also under authority, and have soldiers under me. To one I say ‘Go,’ and he goes, to another ‘Come,’ and he comes, and to my slave ‘Do this or that,’ and he does it.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Jesus listened to this reply, and was astonished, and said to the people following Him, “I solemnly tell you that in no Israelite have I found faith as great as this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And I tell you that many will come from the east and from the west and will recline at table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the Kingdom of the Heavens,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">while the natural heirs of the Kingdom will be driven out into the darkness outside: there will be the weeping aloud and the gnashing of teeth.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Jesus said to the Captain, “Go, and just as you have believed, so be it for you.” And the servant recovered precisely at that time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">After this Jesus went to the house of Peter, whose mother-in-law he found ill in bed with fever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He touched her hand and the fever left her: and then she rose and waited upon Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">In the evening many demoniacs were brought to Him, and with a word He expelled the demons; and He cured all the sick,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">in order that this prediction of the Prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled, “He took on Him our weaknesses, and bore the burden of our diseases.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Seeing great crowds about Him Jesus had given directions to cross to the other side of the Lake,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">when a Scribe came and said to Him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">“Foxes have holes,” replied Jesus, “and birds have nests; but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Another of the disciples said to Him, “Sir, allow me first to go and bury my father.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">“Follow me,” said Jesus, “and leave the dead to bury their own dead.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Then He went on board a fishing-boat, and His disciples followed Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But suddenly there arose a great storm on the Lake, so that the waves threatened to engulf the boat; but He was asleep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">So they came and woke Him, crying, “Master, save us, we are drowning!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">“Why are you so easily frightened,” He replied, “you men of little faith?” Then He rose and reproved the winds and the waves, and there was a perfect calm;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">and the men, filled with amazement, exclaimed, “What kind of man is this? for the very winds and waves obey him!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">On His arrival at the other side, in the country of the Gadarenes, there met Him two men possessed by demons, coming from among the tombs: they were so dangerously fierce that no one was able to pass that way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">They cried aloud, “What hast Thou to do with us, Thou Son of God? Hast Thou come here to torment us before the time?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Now at some distance from them a vast herd of swine were feeding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">So the demons entreated Him. “If Thou drivest us out,” they said, “send us into the herd of swine.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">“Go,” He replied. Then they came out from the men and went into the swine, whereupon the entire herd instantly rushed down the cliff into the Lake and perished in the water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The swineherds fled, and went and told the whole story in the town, including what had happened to the demoniacs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">So at once the whole population came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw Him, they besought Him to leave their country.</p>
