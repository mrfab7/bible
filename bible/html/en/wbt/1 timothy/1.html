<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Savior, and Lord Jesus Christ, who is our hope;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">To Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith; so do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">From which some having swerved, have turned aside to vain jangling;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor concerning what they affirm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But we know that the law is good, if a man useth it lawfully;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers, and murderers of mothers, for man-slayers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For lewd persons, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for men-stealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them who should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, God the only wise, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">This charge I commit to thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mayest war a good warfare;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Holding faith and a good conscience; which some having put away, concerning faith have made shipwreck:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Of whom is Hymeneus and Alexander; whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</p>
