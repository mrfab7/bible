  <verse number="24">And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make upon it a border of gold round about.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And thou shalt make for it a margin of a handbreadth round about, and shalt make a border of gold for the margin thereof round about.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings at the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Close to the margin shall the rings be, as receptacles of the staves to carry the table.</verse>

  <verse number="31">And thou shalt make a lamp-stand of pure gold; [of] beaten work shall the lamp-stand be made: its base and its shaft, its cups, its knobs, and its flowers shall be of the same.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And six branches shall come out of the sides thereof—three branches of the lamp-stand out of one side thereof, and three branches of the lamp-stand out of the other side thereof;</verse>
  <verse number="33">three cups shaped like almonds in the one branch, a knob and a flower: and three cups shaped like almonds in the other branch, a knob and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the lamp-stand.</verse>
