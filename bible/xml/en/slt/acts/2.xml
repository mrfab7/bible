  <verse number="1">And in the day of Pentecost being completed, they were all unanimously in one and the same place.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And suddenly was a sound from heaven as of a wind moving violently, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And seen to them were tongues divided as fire, and it sat upon each one of them.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them to utter.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, circumspect men, from every nation of those under heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And there having been this voice, the multitude came together, and were disturbed, for each one heard them speaking in his own dialect.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And all were affected in mind and wondered, saying to one another, Behold, are not these speaking Galileans.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And how hear we each in our own dialect, in which we were born?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and they dwelling in Mesopotamia, and Judea, and Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia,</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Phrygia, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and parts of Lybia that near Cyrene, and Romans arriving as strangers, and Jews, and strangers,</verse>
  <verse number="11">Cretes and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our tongues the great things of God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And all were affected in mind, and were in doubt, saying one to another, What may this mean to be?</verse>
  <verse number="13">And others mocking said, That they are filled with new wine.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Peter, having stood with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, Men Jews, and all ye dwelling in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and hear ye my words:</verse>
  <verse number="15">For not, as ye suppose, are these intoxicated, (for it is the third hour of the day.)</verse>
  <verse number="16">But this is that spoken by the prophet Joel;</verse>
  <verse number="17">And it shall be in the last days, says God, I pour out from my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your elder dream dreams:</verse>
  <verse number="18">And also upon my servants and upon my maids in those days will I pour out from my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:</verse>
  <verse number="19">And I will give wonders in heaven above, and signs upon the earth below; blood, and fire, and steam of smoke:</verse>
  <verse number="20">The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and distinguished day of the Lord come:</verse>
  <verse number="21">And it shall be, every one, who shall call on the name of the Lord, shall be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Men, Israelites, bear these words; Jesus the Nazarite, a man elected by God for you by powers and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, (as also ye yourselves know:)</verse>
  <verse number="23">This one, surrendered by the fixed counsel and foreknowledge of God, having taken by lawless hands, having fastened, ye slew:</verse>
  <verse number="24">Whom God raised up, having loosed the pains of death: as it was not possible for him to be holden of it.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For David says about him, I saw beforehand the Lord before me always, for he is of my right hand, that I be not moved:</verse>
  <verse number="26">For this my heart was gladdened, and my tongue was transported with joy; and yet also shall my flesh encamp in hope:</verse>
  <verse number="27">For thou wilt not leave my soul in hades neither wilt thou give thy sanctified one to see corruption.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou wilt fill me with gladness with thy face.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Men, brethren, it is permitted to speak with freedom of speech to you of the patriarch David, for he died and was buried, and his tomb is with us even till this day.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God swore with an oath to him, of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, to raise up Christ to sit upon his throne:</verse>
  <verse number="31">Foreknowing, he spake of the rising up of Christ, that his soul was not left in hades, neither did his flesh see corruption.</verse>
  <verse number="32">This Jesus God raised up, of which all we are witnesses.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he poured out this, which ye now see and hear.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For David ascended not into the heavens: and he himself says, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit from my right hand,</verse>
  <verse number="35">Even till I set thine enemies the footstool of thy feet.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Therefore let all the house of Israel know certainly, that God made him Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom ye crucified.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And having heard, they were pricked in heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the sent, What shall we do, men, brethren?</verse>
  <verse number="38">And Peter said to them, Repent, and be each of you immersed in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="39">For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all afar off, as many as the Lord our God should call.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And with many other words he appealed earnestly and besought, saying, Be ye saved from this crooked generation.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Then truly they having gladly received his word were immersed: and in that day were added about three thousand souls.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And they were persevering in the teaching of the sent, and in mutual participation, and breaking of bread, and prayers.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And to every soul was fear: and through the sent were many wonders and signs.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And all believing were in one and the same place, and had all things common:</verse>
  <verse number="45">And sold possessions and goods, and divided them to all, as any one had need.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And in the day persevering unanimously in the temple, and breaking bread in the house, they partook of food with lively joy and simplicity of heart,</verse>
  <verse number="47">Praising God, and having favor with the whole people. And in the day the Lord added the saved to the church.</verse>
