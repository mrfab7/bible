<p class="verse" data-verse="21">and his host, and those that were numbered of them, thirty and two thousand and two hundred;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">and the tribe of Benjamin; the prince of the children of Benjamin being Abidan the son of Gideoni,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">and his host, and those that were numbered of them, thirty and five thousand and four hundred;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">all that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim being a hundred thousand and eight thousand and a hundred, according to their hosts; and they shall set forth third.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="32">These are they that were numbered of the children of Israel by their fathers’ houses; all that were numbered of the camps according to their hosts were six hundred thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Thus did the children of Israel: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so they pitched by their standards, and so they set forward, each one according to its families, and according to its fathers’ houses.</p>
