<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="11" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">You are to imitate me, just as I imitate Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Now I commend you for remembering me in everything and for maintaining the traditions, just as I passed them on to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, for it is just as if her head were shaved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off. And if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, she should cover her head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">A man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For man did not come from woman, but woman from man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For this reason a woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For just as woman came from man, so also man is born of woman. But everything comes from God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Doesn’t nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For long hair is given to her as a covering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If anyone is inclined to dispute this, we have no other practice, nor do the churches of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">In the following instructions I have no praise to offer, because your gatherings do more harm than good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">First of all, I hear that when you come together as a church, there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And indeed, there must be differences among you to show which of you are approved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now then, when you come together, it is not the Lord’s Supper you eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For as you eat, each of you goes ahead without sharing his meal. While one remains hungry, another gets drunk.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Don’t you have your own homes in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What can I say to you? Shall I praise you for this? No, I will not!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you: The Lord Jesus, on the night He was betrayed, took bread,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, “This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">In the same way, after supper He took the cup, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of Me.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until He comes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Each one must examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">That is why many among you are weak and sick, and a number of you have fallen asleep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Now if we judged ourselves properly, we would not come under judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">But when we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">So, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you come together it will not result in judgment. And when I come, I will give instructions about the remaining matters.</p>
