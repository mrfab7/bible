<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Eliphaz the Themanite answered, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Can man be compared with God, even though he were of perfect knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">What doth it profit God if thou be just? or what dost thou give him if thy way be unspotted?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Shall he reprove thee for fear, and come with thee into judgment:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And not for thy manifold wickedness, and thy infinite iniquities?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For thou hast taken away the pledge of thy brethren without cause, and stripped the naked of their clothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thou hast not given water to the weary, thou hast withdrawn bread from the hungry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">In the strength of thy arm thou didst possess the land, and being the most mighty thou holdest it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless thou hast broken in pieces.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore art thou surrounded with snares, and sudden fear troubleth thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And didst thou think that thou shouldst not see darkness, and that thou shouldst not be covered with the violence of overflowing waters?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Dost not thou think that God is higher than heaven, and is elevated above the height of the stars?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And thou sayst: What doth God know? and he judgeth as it were through a mist.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The clouds are his covert, and he doth not consider our things, and he walketh about the poles of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Dost thou desire to keep the path of ages, which wicked men have trodden?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Who were taken away before their time, and a flood hath overthrown their foundation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Who said to God: Depart from us: and looked upon the Almighty as if he could do nothing:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Whereas he had filled their houses with good things: whose way of thinking be far from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The just shall see, and shall rejoice, and the innocent shall laugh them to scorn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Is not their exaltation cut down, and hath not fire devoured the remnants of them?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Submit thyself then to him, and be at peace: and thereby thou shalt have the best fruits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Receive the law of his mouth, and lay up his words in thy heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If thou wilt return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, and shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He shall give for earth flint, and for flint torrents of gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And the Almighty shall be against thy enemies, and silver shall be heaped together for thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Then shalt thou abound in delights in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Thou shalt pray to him, and he will hear thee, and thou shalt pay vows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Thou shalt decree a thing, and it I shall come to thee, and light shall shine in thy ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For he that hath been humbled, shall be in glory: and he that shall bow down his eyes, he shall be saved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The innocent shall be saved, and he shall be saved by the cleanness of his hands.</p>
