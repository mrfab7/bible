<chapter book="Romans" number="3" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">What, then, is the advantage of being a Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Much in every way. First of all, they have been entrusted with the very words of God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">What if some did not have faith? Will their lack of faith nullify God’s faithfulness?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Certainly not! Let God be true and every man a liar. As it is written: “So that You may be proved right when You speak and victorious when You judge.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">But if our unrighteousness highlights the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unjust to inflict His wrath on us? I am speaking in human terms.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Certainly not! In that case, how could God judge the world?</verse>
  <verse number="7">However, if my falsehood accentuates God’s truthfulness, to the increase of His glory, why am I still condemned as a sinner?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Why not say, as some slanderously claim that we say, “Let us do evil that good may result”? Their condemnation is deserved!</verse>
  <verse number="9">What then? Are we any better? Not at all. For we have already made the charge that Jews and Greeks alike are all under sin.</verse>
  <verse number="10">As it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one.</verse>
  <verse number="11">There is no one who understands, no one who seeks God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">“Their throats are open graves; their tongues practice deceit.” “The venom of vipers is on their lips.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">“Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">“Their feet are swift to shed blood;</verse>
  <verse number="16">ruin and misery lie in their wake,</verse>
  <verse number="17">and the way of peace they have not known.”</verse>
  <verse number="18">“There is no fear of God before their eyes.”</verse>
  <verse number="19">Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Therefore no one will be justified in His sight by works of the law. For the law merely brings awareness of sin.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed, as attested by the Law and the Prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And this righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no distinction,</verse>
  <verse number="23">for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</verse>
  <verse number="24">and are justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="25">God presented Him as an atoning sacrifice in His blood through faith, in order to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance He had passed over the sins committed beforehand.</verse>
  <verse number="26">He did this to demonstrate His righteousness at the present time, so as to be just and to justify the one who has faith in Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. On what principle? On that of works? No, but on that of faith.</verse>
  <verse number="28">For we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the law.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Is God the God of Jews only? Is He not the God of Gentiles too? Yes, of Gentiles too,</verse>
  <verse number="30">since there is only one God, who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Certainly not! Instead, we uphold the law.</verse>
