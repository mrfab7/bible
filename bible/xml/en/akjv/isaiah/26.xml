<chapter book="Isaiah" number="26" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Open you the gates, that the righteous nation which keeps the truth may enter in.</verse>
  <verse number="3">You will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on you: because he trusts in you.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Trust you in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength:</verse>
  <verse number="5">For he brings down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he lays it low; he lays it low, even to the ground; he brings it even to the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The way of the just is uprightness: you, most upright, do weigh the path of the just.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Yes, in the way of your judgments, O LORD, have we waited for you; the desire of our soul is to your name, and to the remembrance of you.</verse>
  <verse number="9">With my soul have I desired you in the night; yes, with my spirit within me will I seek you early: for when your judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Let favor be showed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="11">LORD, when your hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they shall see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yes, the fire of your enemies shall devour them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">LORD, you will ordain peace for us: for you also have worked all our works in us.</verse>
  <verse number="13">O LORD our God, other lords beside you have had dominion over us: but by you only will we make mention of your name.</verse>
  <verse number="14">They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore have you visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.</verse>
  <verse number="15">You have increased the nation, O LORD, you have increased the nation: you are glorified: you had removed it far to all the ends of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="16">LORD, in trouble have they visited you, they poured out a prayer when your chastening was on them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Like as a woman with child, that draws near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and cries out in her pangs; so have we been in your sight, O LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="18">We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not worked any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Your dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, you that dwell in dust: for your dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Come, my people, enter you into your chambers, and shut your doors about you: hide yourself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be over.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For, behold, the LORD comes out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.</verse>
