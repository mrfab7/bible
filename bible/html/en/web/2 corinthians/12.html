<p class="verse" data-verse="1">It is doubtless not profitable for me to boast. For I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I know a man in Christ, fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I don’t know, or whether out of the body, I don’t know; God knows), such a one caught up into the third heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I know such a man (whether in the body, or outside of the body, I don’t know; God knows),</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">how he was caught up into Paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For if I would desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak the truth. But I refrain, so that no man may think more of me than that which he sees in me, or hears from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">By reason of the exceeding greatness of the revelations, that I should not be exalted excessively, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, that I should not be exalted excessively.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Concerning this thing, I begged the Lord three times that it might depart from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He has said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Most gladly therefore I will rather glory in my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest on me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore I take pleasure in weaknesses, in injuries, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ’s sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I have become foolish in boasting. You compelled me, for I ought to have been commended by you, for in nothing was I inferior to the very best apostles, though I am nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and mighty works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For what is there in which you were made inferior to the rest of the assemblies, unless it is that I myself was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Behold, this is the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I seek not your possessions, but you. For the children ought not to save up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more abundantly, am I loved the less?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But be it so, I did not myself burden you. But, being crafty, I caught you with deception.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Did I take advantage of you by anyone of them whom I have sent to you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I exhorted Titus, and I sent the brother with him. Did Titus take any advantage of you? Didn’t we walk in the same spirit? Didn’t we walk in the same steps?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Again, do you think that we are excusing ourselves to you? In the sight of God we speak in Christ. But all things, beloved, are for your edifying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For I am afraid that by any means, when I come, I might find you not the way I want to, and that I might be found by you as you don’t desire; that by any means there would be strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, slander, whisperings, proud thoughts, riots;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">that again when I come my God would humble me before you, and I would mourn for many of those who have sinned before now, and not repented of the uncleanness and sexual immorality and lustfulness which they committed.</p>
