<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Command the children of Israel, that they bring to you pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Outside of the veil of the Testimony, in the Tent of Meeting, shall Aaron keep it in order from evening to morning before Yahweh continually: it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He shall keep in order the lamps on the pure gold lampstand before Yahweh continually.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">“You shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it: two tenth parts of an ephah shall be in one cake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">You shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure gold table before Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">You shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by fire to Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before Yahweh continually. It is on the behalf of the children of Israel an everlasting covenant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">It shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it in a holy place: for it is most holy to him of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire by a perpetual statute.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed; and they brought him to Moses. His mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They put him in custody, until the will of Yahweh should be declared to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">“Bring out of the camp him who cursed; and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He who blasphemes the name of Yahweh, he shall surely be put to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him: the foreigner as well as the native-born, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">“‘He who strikes any man mortally shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He who strikes an animal mortally shall make it good, life for life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If anyone injures his neighbor; as he has done, so shall it be done to him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; as he has injured someone, so shall it be done to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He who kills an animal shall make it good; and he who kills a man shall be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">You shall have one kind of law, for the foreigner as well as the native-born: for I am Yahweh your God.’”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they brought out him who had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones. The children of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses.</p>
