  <verse number="1">And Jesus answering spoke to them again in parables, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">The kingdom of the heavens has become like a king who made a wedding feast for his son,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and sent his bondmen to call the persons invited to the wedding feast, and they would not come.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Again he sent other bondmen, saying, Say to the persons invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fatted beasts are killed, and all things ready; come to the wedding feast.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But they made light of it, and went, one to his own land, and another to his commerce.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the rest, laying hold of his bondmen, ill-treated and slew [them].</verse>
  <verse number="7">And [when] the king [heard of it he] was wroth, and having sent his forces, destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then he says to his bondmen, The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy;</verse>
  <verse number="9">go therefore into the thoroughfares of the highways, and as many as ye shall find invite to the wedding feast.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And those bondmen went out into the highways, and brought together all as many as they found, both evil and good; and the wedding feast was furnished with guests.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the king, having gone in to see the guests, beheld there a man not clothed with a wedding garment.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he says to him, [My] friend, how camest thou in here not having on a wedding garment? But he was speechless.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then said the king to the servants, Bind him feet and hands, and take him away, and cast him out into the outer darkness: there shall be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For many are called ones, but few chosen ones.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then went the Pharisees and held a council how they might ensnare him in speaking.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they send out to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that thou art true and teachest the way of God in truth, and carest not for any one, for thou regardest not men’s person;</verse>
  <verse number="17">tell us therefore what thou thinkest: Is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</verse>
  <verse number="18">But Jesus, knowing their wickedness, said, Why tempt ye me, hypocrites?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Shew me the money of the tribute. And they presented to him a denarius.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he says to them, Whose [is] this image and superscription?</verse>
  <verse number="21">They say to him, Caesar’s. Then he says to them, Pay then what is Caesar’s to Caesar, and what is God’s to God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And when they heard [him], they wondered, and left him, and went away.</verse>
  <verse number="23">On that day came to him Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and they demanded of him,</verse>
  <verse number="24">saying, Teacher, Moses said, If any one die, not having children, his brother shall marry his wife and shall raise up seed to his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Now there were with us seven brethren; and the first having married died, and not having seed, left his wife to his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="26">In like manner also the second and the third, unto the seven.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And last of all the woman also died.</verse>
  <verse number="28">In the resurrection therefore of which of the seven shall she be wife, for all had her?</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Jesus answering said to them, Ye err, not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as angels of God in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="31">But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read what was spoken to you by God, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="32">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not God of [the] dead, but of [the] living.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And when the crowds heard [it] they were astonished at his doctrine.</verse>
  <verse number="34">But the Pharisees, having heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, were gathered together.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And one of them, a lawyer, demanded, tempting him, and saying,</verse>
  <verse number="36">Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?</verse>
  <verse number="37">And he said to him, Thou shalt love [the] Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="38">This is [the] great and first commandment.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And [the] second is like it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</verse>
  <verse number="40">On these two commandments the whole law and the prophets hang.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And the Pharisees being gathered together, Jesus demanded of them,</verse>
  <verse number="42">saying, What think ye concerning the Christ? whose son is he? They say to him, David’s.</verse>
  <verse number="43">He says to them, How then does David in Spirit call him Lord, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="44">The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand until I put thine enemies under thy feet?</verse>
  <verse number="45">If therefore David call him Lord, how is he his son?</verse>
  <verse number="46">And no one was able to answer him a word, nor did any one dare from that day to question him any more.</verse>
