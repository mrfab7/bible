  <verse number="1">And Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars here for me, and prepare as many calves, and the same number of rams.”</verse>
  <verse number="2">And when he had acted according to the words of Balaam, they placed a calf and a ram together on each altar.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Balaam said to Balak: “Stand for a little while next to your holocaust, until I go, to see if perhaps the Lord will meet with me. And whatever he will command, I shall speak to you.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">And after he had quickly departed, God met with him. And Balaam, speaking to him, said: “I have set up seven altars, and I have placed a calf and a ram on each.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then the Lord placed the word in his mouth, and he said: “Return to Balak, and you shall say this.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">Returning, he found Balak standing next to his holocaust, with all the leaders of the Moabites.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And taking up his parable, he said: “Balak, king of the Moabites, has led me from Aram, from the mountains of the east. ‘Come forth,’ he said, ‘and curse Jacob. Hurry and condemn Israel.’</verse>
  <verse number="8">How shall I curse him, whom God has not cursed? For what reason would I condemn him, whom the Lord does not condemn?</verse>
  <verse number="9">I will look upon him from the tops of the stones, and I will consider him from the hills. This people shall dwell alone, and they shall not be counted among the nations.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Who can number the dust that is Jacob, and who can know the number of the stock of Israel? May my soul die a just death, and may my end be like theirs.”</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Balak said to Balaam: “What is this that you are doing? I called for you, in order to curse my enemies, and to the contrary, you bless them.”</verse>
  <verse number="12">He answered him, “How can I say anything other than what the Lord orders?”</verse>
  <verse number="13">Therefore, Balak said: “Come with me to another place, from where you may see a portion of Israel, though you cannot see them all. Curse them from there.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">And when he had led him to a lofty place, on the top of mount Pisgah, Balaam built seven altars, and placing upon each a calf and a ram,</verse>
  <verse number="15">he said to Balak, “Stand here next to your holocaust, while I continue on to meet him.”</verse>
  <verse number="16">And when the Lord had met him, and had put the word in his mouth, he said, “Return to Balak, and you shall say this to him.”</verse>
  <verse number="17">Returning, he found him standing next to his holocaust, and the leaders of the Moabites were with him. And Balak said to him, “What has the Lord spoken?”</verse>
  <verse number="18">But, taking up his parable, he said: “Stand, Balak, and pay attention. Listen, you son of Zippor.</verse>
  <verse number="19">God is not like a man, so that he would lie, nor is he like a son of man, so that he would be changed. Therefore, having spoken, will he not act? Has he ever spoken, and not fulfilled?</verse>
  <verse number="20">I was led here to bless, and I have no strength to hinder the blessing.</verse>
  <verse number="21">There is no idol in Jacob; neither is there a false image to be seen in Israel. The Lord his God is with him, and the resound of royal victory is in him.</verse>
  <verse number="22">God has led him away from Egypt; his strength is like that of the rhinoceros.</verse>
  <verse number="23">There is no soothsaying in Jacob, nor any divination in Israel. In their times, it shall be told to Jacob and to Israel what God has wrought.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Behold, the people will rise up like a lioness, and lie down like a lion. But they will not lie down until they devour the prey and drink the blood of the slain.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">And Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse him, nor bless him.”</verse>
  <verse number="26">And he said, “Have I not told you that whatever God would command of me, I would do?”</verse>
  <verse number="27">And Balak said to him: “Come and I will lead you to another place. If perhaps it may please God, then you may curse them from there.”</verse>
  <verse number="28">And when he had led him on to the top of mount Peor, which looks out toward the wilderness,</verse>
  <verse number="29">Balaam said to him, “Build seven altars here for me, and prepare as many calves, and the same number of rams.”</verse>
  <verse number="30">Balak did as Balaam had said, and he placed on each altar a calf and a ram.</verse>
