<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Let brotherly love continue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; [and] them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Marriage [is] honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">[Let your] conversation [be] without covetousness; [and be] content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">So that we may boldly say, The Lord [is] my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of [their] conversation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For [it is] a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of [our] lips giving thanks to his name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that [is] unprofitable for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But I beseech [you] the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom [be] glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Know ye that [our] brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Grace [be] with you all. Amen.</p>
