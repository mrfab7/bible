<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now this, dearly beloved, the second epistle I write to you; in which I awaken your pure mind by putting in remembrance:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">To remember the words spoken before by the holy prophets, and the command of us the sent of the Lord and Saviour:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Knowing this first, that in the last of the days shall mockers come for deceiving, going according to their own eager desires,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And saying, Where is the solemn promise of his presence? for from the time the fathers were set to sleep, so continue all things from the beginning of creation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For being willing this is unknown to them, that the heavens were a long while ago, and the earth having stood out of water and by water, by the word of God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">By which then the world, overflowed with water, perished:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And now the heavens and the earth, by the same word are stored up, being kept for fire to the day of judgment and of the perdition of irreligious men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And let not this one thing be unknown to you, dearly beloved, that one day with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The Lord puts not off the solemn promise, as some deem slowness; but is longsuffering to us, not willing any to perish, but all should have room for repentance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in which the heavens shall pass away with a loud noise, and the elements, suffering from excessive heat, shall be dissolved, and the earth and the works in it shall be burned down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Therefore all these being dissolved, of what race ought ye to be in holy turning round and devotion,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Expecting and seeking earnestly the presence of the day of God, during which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements going to be burned are melted away?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But we expect new heavens and a new earth, according to promise, in which dwells justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Wherefore, dearly beloved, expecting these, be earnest, spotless and blameless, to be found by him in peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the longsuffering of our Lord deem ye salvation; as also our dearly beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given him, wrote to you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">As also in all the epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things difficult to understand, which the unlearned and unstable pervert, as also the rest of the writings, to their own perdition.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">You therefore, dearly beloved, knowing beforehand, watch, lest, led away by the error of the lawless, ye fall from your own stability.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And grow ye in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him the glory now and to the day of eternity. Amen.</p>
