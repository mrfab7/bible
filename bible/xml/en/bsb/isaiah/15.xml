  <verse number="1">This is the burden against Moab: Ar in Moab is ruined, destroyed in a night! Kir in Moab is devastated, destroyed in a night!</verse>
  <verse number="2">Dibon goes up to its temple to weep at its high places. Moab wails over Nebo, as well as over Medeba. Every head is shaved, every beard is cut off.</verse>
  <verse number="3">In its streets they wear sackcloth; on the rooftops and in the public squares they all wail, falling down weeping.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Heshbon and Elealeh cry out; their voices are heard as far as Jahaz. Therefore the soldiers of Moab cry out; their souls tremble within.</verse>
  <verse number="5">My heart cries out over Moab; her fugitives flee as far as Zoar, as far as Eglath-shelishiyah. With weeping they ascend the slope of Luhith; they lament their destruction on the road to Horonaim.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The waters of Nimrim are dried up, and the grass is withered; the vegetation is gone, and the greenery is no more.</verse>
  <verse number="7">So they carry their wealth and belongings over the Brook of the Willows.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For their outcry echoes to the border of Moab. Their wailing reaches Eglaim; it is heard in Beer-elim.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The waters of Dimon are full of blood, but I will bring more upon Dimon—a lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon the remnant of the land.</verse>
