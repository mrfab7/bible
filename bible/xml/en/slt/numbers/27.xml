  <verse number="1">And there will come near the daughters of Zelophehad son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, for the families of Manesseh, son of Joseph: and these the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And they will stand before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the chiefs, and all the assembly at the door of the tent of appointment, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="3">Our father died in the desert, and he was not in the midst of the assembly of them being gathered together against Jehovah, in the assembly of Korah; for he died in his sin, and there were no sons to him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Wherefore shall the name of our father be taken away from the midst of his family because there is not to him a son? Thou shalt give to us a possession in the midst of the brethren of our father.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Moses will bring near their judgment before Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The daughters of Zelophehad spake rightly: giving, thou shalt give to them the possession of an inheritance in the midst of the brethren of their father, and cause the inheritance of their father to pass over to them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And to the sons of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, A man when he shall die, and no son to him, and cause ye his inheritance to pass to his daughter.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And if no daughter to him, give his inheritance to his brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And if no brethren to him, give ye his inheritance to the brethren of his father.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And if no brethren to his father, give his inheritance to his remainder being near to him from his family; and he shall possess it, and it shall be to the sons of Israel for a law of judgment, as Jehovah commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Jehovah will say to Moses, Come up to this mountain of the regions beyond, and see the land which I gave to the sons of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And thou sawest it, and wert gathered to thy people, thou also, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.</verse>
  <verse number="14">As ye rebelled against my mouth in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the assembly to consecrate me at the waters before their eyes, these the Waters of Strife, of Kadish of the desert of Zin.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Moses will speak to Jehovah, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="16">Will Jehovah, the God of the spirits to all flesh, appoint a man over the assembly,</verse>
  <verse number="17">Who will go out before them, and who will come in before them, and who shall bring them out, and who shall bring them in; and the assembly of Jehovah shall not be as sheep to whom not a shepherd to them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Jehovah will say to Moses, Take to thee Joshua, son of Nun, a man in whom the spirit in him, and place thy hand upon him;</verse>
  <verse number="19">And make him to stand before Eleazar the priest, and before all the assembly: and command him before their eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And give from thy majesty upon him, so that all the assembly of the sons of Israel shall hear him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And before Eleazar the priest, he shall stand, and he asked for him in the judgment of the Lights before Jehovah: at his mouth they shall go out, and at his mouth they shall come in, he and all the sons of Israel with him, and all the assembly.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Moses will do as Jehovah commanded him; and he will take Joshua and will make him stand before Eleazar the priest, and before all the assembly.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he will place his hands upon him and command him as Jehovah spake by the hand of Moses.</verse>
