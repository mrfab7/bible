<chapter book="1 Samuel" number="15" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Samuel also said to Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint you to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore listen you to the voice of the words of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thus said the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for you showed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until you come to Shur, that is over against Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatted calves, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then came the word of the LORD to Samuel, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="11">It repents me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried to the LORD all night.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said to him, Blessed be you of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Samuel said, What means then this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice to the LORD your God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell you what the LORD has said to me this night. And he said to him, Say on.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Samuel said, When you were little in your own sight, were you not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed you king over Israel?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the LORD sent you on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Why then did you not obey the voice of the LORD, but did fly on the spoil, and did evil in the sight of the LORD?</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Saul said to Samuel, Yes, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Samuel said, Has the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and your words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Now therefore, I pray you, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you: for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold on the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Samuel said to him, The LORD has rent the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours, that is better than you.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Then he said, I have sinned: yet honor me now, I pray you, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="31">So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Then said Samuel, Bring you here to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came to him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And Samuel said, As the sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.</verse>
