<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Lords, render ye to servants Justice and equality; knowing that ye also have a Lord in the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">In prayer persevere, watching in it in gratitude.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Praying together also for us, that God would open to us a door of the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, by which also I was bound;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">That I might manifest, as is fitting for me to speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">In wisdom walk toward them without, purchasing the time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Your word always in grace, Seasoned with salt, to know how it is fitting for you to answer one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All things concerning me shall Tychicus make known to you, a dearly beloved brother, and a faithful servant and fellowservant in the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Whom I sent to you for this same, that he might know the things concerning you, and comfort your hearts;</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Jesus, called Justus, they being of the circumcision. These only fellow workers in the kingdom of God, which were a consolation to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Epaphras, who of you, greets you, a servant of Christ, always contending for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfected and completed in all the will of God.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Greet the brethren in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church in his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And when the epistle shall be read among you, make that also it be read to the church in Laodicea; and that ye also read that from Laodicea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And say to Archippus, Look out for the service which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fill it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The greeting of Paul by my hand. Remember my bonds. Grace with you. Amen.</p>
