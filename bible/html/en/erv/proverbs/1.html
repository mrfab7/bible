<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">To know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">To receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness and judgment and equity;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; and that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">To understand a proverb, and a figure; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, and whole, as those that go down into the pit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thou shalt cast thy lot among us; we will all have one purse:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For in vain is the net spread, in the eyes of any bird:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And these lay wait for their own blood, they lurk privily for their own lives.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; it taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Wisdom crieth aloud in the street; she uttereth her voice in the broad places;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">She crieth in the chief place of concourse; at the entering in of the gates, in the city, she uttereth her words:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and scorners delight them in scorning, and fools hate knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I also will laugh in the day of your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">When your fear cometh as a storm, and your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come upon you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me diligently, but they shall not find me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">They would none of my counsel; they despised all my reproof:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, and shall be quiet without fear of evil.</p>
