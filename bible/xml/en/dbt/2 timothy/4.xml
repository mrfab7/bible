  <verse number="1">I testify before God and Christ Jesus, who is about to judge living and dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom,</verse>
  <verse number="2">proclaim the word; be urgent in season [and] out of season, convict, rebuke, encourage, with all longsuffering and doctrine.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the time shall be when they will not bear sound teaching; but according to their own lusts will heap up to themselves teachers, having an itching ear;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and they will turn away their ear from the truth, and will have turned aside to fables.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But thou, be sober in all things, bear evils, do [the] work of an evangelist, fill up the full measure of thy ministry.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For I am already being poured out, and the time of my release is come.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I have combated the good combat, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Henceforth the crown of righteousness is laid up for me, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will render to me in that day; but not only to me, but also to all who love his appearing.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Use diligence to come to me quickly;</verse>
  <verse number="10">for Demas has forsaken me, having loved the present age, and is gone to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Luke alone is with me. Take Mark, and bring [him] with thyself, for he is serviceable to me for ministry.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The cloak which I left behind [me] in Troas at Carpus’s, bring when thou comest, and the books, especially the parchments.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Alexander the smith did many evil things against me. The Lord will render to him according to his works.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Against whom be thou also on thy guard, for he has greatly withstood our words.</verse>
  <verse number="16">At my first defence no man stood with me, but all deserted me. May it not be imputed to them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But the Lord stood with [me], and gave me power, that through me the proclamation might be fully made, and all [those of] the nations should hear; and I was delivered out of the lion’s mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The Lord shall deliver me from every wicked work, and shall preserve [me] for his heavenly kingdom; to whom [be] glory for the ages of ages. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the house of Onesiphorus.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Erastus remained in Corinth, but Trophimus I left behind in Miletus sick.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Use diligence to come before winter. Eubulus salutes thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and the brethren all.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit. Grace [be] with you.</verse>
