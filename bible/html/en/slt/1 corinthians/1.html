<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, called, sent of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Sosthenes the brother,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">To the church of God being in Corinth, to the consecrated in Christ Jesus, to the Called holy ones, with all calling upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both theirs and ours:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I return thanks to my God always for you, for the grace of God given you in Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">That in every thing we were enriched in him, in all the word, and all knowledge;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">As the testimony of Jesus Christ was made firm in you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">So that ye are not wanting in any grace; awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Who also shall make you firm even to the end, blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">God faithful, by whom we were called to the communion of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same, and there be no divisions in you; and ye be set in order in the same mind and in the same knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For it was manifested to me concerning you, my brethren, by them of Chloe, that there are contentions with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And this I say, that each of you says, I truly am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Has Christ been divided? Paul was not crucified for you? or in Paulâ€™s name were ye immersed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I thank God that I immersed none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Lest any should say that in my name I have immersed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And I immersed also the house of Stephanas: besides, I know not if I immersed any other.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For Christ sent me not to immerse, but to announce good news: not in wisdom of word, lest the cross of Christ be made void.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For truly the word of the cross to them perishing is foolishness; but to us saved it is the power of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For it has been written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and put away the understanding of the intelligent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Where the wise? where the scribe? where the seekers together of this life has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For since in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, God was contented by the foolishness of proclaiming to save them believing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And since the Jews ask a sign, and the Greeks seek wisdom:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And we proclaim Christ crucified, to the Jews truly a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And to these the called, to both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and wisdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For the foolish thing of God is wiser than men; and the weak thing of God is stronger than men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For ye see your calling, brethren, that not many wise according to the flesh, not many powerful, not, many well born:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">But the foolish things of the world, has God chosen that he might shame the wise; and the weak things of the world has God chosen that he might shame things strong;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And the ignoble things of the world, and the despised things, has God chosen, and things not being, that the things being he might leave unemployed:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">That no flesh might boast before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And ye are of him in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, and also justice, and consecration, and holiness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">That, as it has been written, Let him boasting, boast in the Lord.</p>
