  <verse number="1">Awake, awake, put on your strength, Zion; put on your beautiful garments, Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Shake yourself from the dust! Arise, sit up, Jerusalem! Release yourself from the bonds of your neck, captive daughter of Zion!</verse>
  <verse number="3">For thus says Yahweh, “You were sold for nothing; and you shall be redeemed without money.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">For thus says the Lord Yahweh, “My people went down at the first into Egypt to live there: and the Assyrian has oppressed them without cause.</verse>
  <verse number="5">“Now therefore, what do I do here,” says Yahweh, “seeing that my people are taken away for nothing? Those who rule over them mock,” says Yahweh, “and my name continually all the day is blasphemed.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Therefore my people shall know my name. Therefore they shall know in that day that I am he who speaks; behold, it is I.”</verse>
  <verse number="7">How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of good, who publishes salvation, who says to Zion, “Your God reigns!”</verse>
  <verse number="8">The voice of your watchmen! they lift up the voice, together do they sing; for they shall see eye to eye, when Yahweh returns to Zion.</verse>

  <verse number="12">For you shall not go out in haste, neither shall you go by flight: for Yahweh will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rear guard.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Behold, my servant shall deal wisely, he shall be exalted and lifted up, and shall be very high.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Like as many were astonished at you (his appearance was marred more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men),</verse>
  <verse number="15">so shall he sprinkle many nations; kings shall shut their mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they understand.</verse>
