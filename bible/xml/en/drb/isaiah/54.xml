  <verse number="8">In a moment of indignation have I hid my face a little while from thee, but with everlasting kindness have I had mercy on thee, said the Lord thy Redeemer.</verse>
  <verse number="9">This thing is to me as in the days of Noe, to whom I swore, that I would no more bring in the waters of Noe upon the earth: so have I sworn not to be angry with thee, and not to rebuke thee.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For the mountains shall be moved, and the hills shall tremble; but my mercy shall not depart from thee, and the covenant of my peace shall not be moved: said the Lord that hath mercy on thee.</verse>
  <verse number="11">O poor little one, tossed with tempest, without all comfort, behold I will lay thy stones in order, and will lay thy foundations with sapphires,</verse>
  <verse number="12">And I will make thy bulwarks of jasper: and thy gates of graven stones, and all thy borders of desirable stones.</verse>
  <verse number="13">All thy children shall be taught of the Lord: and great shall be the peace of thy children.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And thou shalt be founded in justice: depart far from oppression, for thou shalt not fear; and from terror, for it shall not come near thee.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Behold, an inhabitant shall come, who was not with me, he that was a stranger to thee before, shall be joined to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and bringeth forth an instrument for his work, and I have created the killer to destroy.</verse>
  <verse number="17">No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper: and every tongue that resisteth thee in judgment, thou shalt condemn. This is the inheritance of the servants of the Lord, and their justice with me, saith the Lord.</verse>
