<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The Baldad the Suhite answered, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How long wilt thou speak these things, and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Doth God pervert judgment, or doth the Almighty overthrow that which is just?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Although thy children have sinned against him, and he hath left them in the hand of their iniquity:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Yet if thou wilt arise early to God, and wilt beseech the Almighty:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If thou wilt walk clean and upright, he will presently awake onto thee, and will make the dwelling of thy justice peaceable:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Insomuch, that if thy former things were small, thy latter things would be multiplied exceedingly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For inquire of the former generation, and search diligently into the memory of the fathers:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">(For we are but of yesterday, and are ignorant that our days upon earth are but a shadow:)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And they shall teach thee: they shall speak to thee, and utter words out of their hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Can the rush be green without moisture? or a sedge-bush grow without water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When it is yet in flower, and is not plucked up with the hand, it withereth before all herbs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Even so are the ways of all that forget God, and the hope of the hypocrite shall perish:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">His folly shall not please him, and his trust shall be like the spiderâ€™s web.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He shall lean upon his house, and it shall not stand: he shall prop it up, and it shall not rise:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He seemeth to have moisture before the sun cometh, and at his rising his blossom shall shoot forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">His roots shall be thick upon a heap of stones, and among the stones he shall abide.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If one swallow him up out of his place, he shall deny him, and shall say: I know thee not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For this is the joy of his way, that others may spring again out of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">God will not cast away the simple, nor reach out his hand to the evildoer:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Until thy mouth be filled with laughter, and thy lips with rejoicing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">They that hate thee, shall be clothed with confusion: and the dwelling of the wicked shall not stand.</p>
