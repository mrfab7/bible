  <verse number="1">Thus said Jehovah, Where this writing of cutting off of your mother which I sent her away? or which of my creditors whom I sold you to him? Behold, in your iniquities ye sold yourselves, and in your transgressions your mother was sent away.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Wherefore, I came, and no man? I called and none answered. Being short, was my hand shortened from redeeming? and if not power in me to deliver behold, in my rebuke I will dry up the sea; I will set the rivers a desert: their fish shall stink from no water, and they shall die with thirst.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I will put darkness upon the heavens, and I will put sackcloth their covering.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The Lord Jehovah gave to me the tongue of the expert to know to help the weary with a word: he will rouse up in the morning by morning, he will rouse up to me the ear to hear as the expert.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The Lord Jehovah opened to me the ear and I opposed not, and I drew not back.</verse>
  <verse number="6">My back I gave to those smiting, and my cheeks to those tearing out the hair: and my face I hid not from shame and spittle.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the Lord Jehovah will help to me: for this I was not ashamed; for this I set my face as the flint, and I shall know that I shall not be ashamed.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He drawing near justifying me: who shall contend with me? we will stand together: who the lord of my judgment? he shall draw near to me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Behold, the Lord Jehovah will help for me; who is he that shall condemn me? behold, they all shall decay as a garment; the moth shall eat them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Who among you fearing Jehovah, hearing to the voice of his servant? who goes in darkness and no light to him? he shall trust in the name of Jehovah and rest upon his God.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Behold, all ye kindling a fire, girding yourselves with fiery darts: go ye in the light of your fire, and in the fiery darts ye kindled. From my hand was this to you; ye shall lie down for sorrow.</verse>
