  <verse number="1">When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider well who is before thee;</verse>
  <verse number="2">and put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Be not desirous of his dainties; for they are deceitful food.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Weary not thyself to become rich; cease from thine own intelligence:</verse>
  <verse number="5">wilt thou set thine eyes upon it, it is gone; for indeed it maketh itself wings and it flieth away as an eagle towards the heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Eat thou not the food of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainties.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For as he thinketh in his soul, so is he. Eat and drink! will he say unto thee; but his heart is not with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thy morsel which thou hast eaten must thou vomit up, and thou wilt have wasted thy sweet words.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Speak not in the ears of a foolish [man], for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Remove not the ancient landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:</verse>
  <verse number="11">for their redeemer is mighty; he will plead their cause against thee.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Apply thy heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Withhold not correction from the child; for [if] thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die:</verse>
  <verse number="14">thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from Sheol.</verse>
  <verse number="15">My son, if thy heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine;</verse>
  <verse number="16">and my reins shall exult, when thy lips speak right things.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Let not thy heart envy sinners, but [be thou] in the fear of Jehovah all the day;</verse>
  <verse number="18">for surely there is a result, and thine expectation shall not be cut off.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Thou, my son, hear and be wise, and direct thy heart in the way.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Be not among winebibbers, among riotous eaters of flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty; and drowsiness clotheth with rags.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Buy the truth, and sell it not; wisdom, and instruction, and intelligence.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The father of a righteous [man] shall greatly rejoice, and he that begetteth a wise [son] shall have joy of him:</verse>
  <verse number="25">let thy father and thy mother have joy, and let her that bore thee rejoice.</verse>
  <verse number="26">My son, give me thy heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.</verse>
  <verse number="28">She also lieth in wait as a robber, and increaseth the treacherous among men.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Who hath woe? Who hath sorrow? Who contentions? Who complaining? Who wounds without cause? Who redness of eyes?</verse>
  <verse number="30">—They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to try mixed wine.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Look not upon the wine when it is red, when it sparkleth in the cup, and goeth down smoothly:</verse>
  <verse number="32">at the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thy heart shall speak froward things;</verse>
  <verse number="34">and thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, and as he that lieth down upon the top of a mast:</verse>
  <verse number="35">—‘’They have smitten me, [and] I am not sore; they have beaten me, [and] I knew it not. When shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.’’</verse>
