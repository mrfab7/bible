  <verse number="1">The words of the preacher, the son of David, king of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="3">What profit hath a man of all his labor, which he taketh under the sun?</verse>
  <verse number="4">One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The sun also riseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The wind goeth towards the south, and turneth about to the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to its circuits.</verse>
  <verse number="7">All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; to the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.</verse>
  <verse number="8">All things are full of labor; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Is there any thing of which it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.</verse>
  <verse number="11">There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I the preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this grievous labor hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised with it.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="15">That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I communed with my own heart, saying, Lo, I have come to great estate, and have gained more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: and my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</verse>
