<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="13" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">This third time do I come unto you; on the mouth of two witnesses or three shall every saying be established;</verse>
  <verse number="2">I have said before, and I say it before, as being present, the second time, and being absent, now, do I write to those having sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again, I will not spare,</verse>
  <verse number="3">since a proof ye seek of the Christ speaking in me, who to you is not infirm, but is powerful in you,</verse>
  <verse number="4">for even if he was crucified from infirmity, yet he doth live from the power of God; for we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him from the power of God toward you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Your own selves try ye, if ye are in the faith; your own selves prove ye; do ye not know your own selves, that Jesus Christ is in you, if ye be not in some respect disapproved of?</verse>
  <verse number="6">and I hope that ye shall know that we—we are not disapproved of;</verse>
  <verse number="7">and I pray before God that ye do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that ye may do that which is right, and we may be as disapproved;</verse>
  <verse number="8">for we are not able to do anything against the truth, but for the truth;</verse>
  <verse number="9">for we rejoice when we may be infirm, and ye may be powerful; and this also we pray for—your perfection!</verse>
  <verse number="10">because of this, these things—being absent—I write, that being present, I may not treat any sharply, according to the authority that the Lord did give me for building up, and not for casting down.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Henceforth, brethren, rejoice; be made perfect, be comforted, be of the same mind, be at peace, and the God of the love and peace shall be with you;</verse>
  <verse number="12">salute one another in an holy kiss;</verse>
  <verse number="13">salute you do all the saints;</verse>
  <verse number="14">the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, is with you all! Amen.</verse>
