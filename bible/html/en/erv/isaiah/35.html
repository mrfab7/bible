<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing; the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon: they shall see the glory of the LORD, the excellency of our God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, with the recompence of God; he will come and save you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the glowing sand shall become a pool, and the thirsty ground springs of water: in the habitation of jackals, where they lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, yea fools, shall not err therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">No lion shall be there, nor shall any ravenous beast go up thereon, they shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</p>
