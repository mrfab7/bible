<chapter book="Galatians" number="1" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Paul, apostle, not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God [the] Father who raised him from among [the] dead,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and all the brethren with me, to the assemblies of Galatia.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Grace to you, and peace, from God [the] Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
  <verse number="4">who gave himself for our sins, so that he should deliver us out of the present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father;</verse>
  <verse number="5">to whom [be] glory to the ages of ages. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I wonder that ye thus quickly change, from him that called you in Christ’s grace, to a different gospel,</verse>
  <verse number="7">which is not another [one]; but there are some that trouble you, and desire to pervert the glad tidings of the Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But if even we or an angel out of heaven announce as glad tidings to you [anything] besides what we have announced as glad tidings to you, let him be accursed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">As we have said before, now also again I say, If any one announce to you as glad tidings [anything] besides what ye have received, let him be accursed.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For do I now seek to satisfy men or God? or do I seek to please men? If I were yet pleasing men, I were not Christ’s bondman.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But I let you know, brethren, [as to] the glad tidings which were announced by me, that they are not according to man.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For neither did I receive them from man, neither was I taught [them], but by revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For ye have heard [what was] my conversation formerly in Judaism, that I excessively persecuted the assembly of God, and ravaged it;</verse>
  <verse number="14">and advanced in Judaism beyond many [my] contemporaries in my nation, being exceedingly zealous of the doctrines of my fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But when God, who set me apart [even] from my mother’s womb, and called [me] by his grace,</verse>
  <verse number="16">was pleased to reveal his Son in me, that I may announce him as glad tidings among the nations, immediately I took not counsel with flesh and blood,</verse>
  <verse number="17">nor went I up to Jerusalem to those [who were] apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to make acquaintance with Peter, and I remained with him fifteen days;</verse>
  <verse number="19">but I saw none other of the apostles, but James the brother of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Now what I write to you, behold, before God, I do not lie.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But I was unknown personally to the assemblies of Judaea which [are] in Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="23">only they were hearing that he who persecuted us formerly now announces the glad tidings of the faith which formerly he ravaged:</verse>
  <verse number="24">and they glorified God in me.</verse>
