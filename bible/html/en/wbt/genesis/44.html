<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, and his corn money: and he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they, and their asses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And when they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off, Joseph said to his steward, Arise, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say to them, Why have ye rewarded evil for good?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Is not this the cup in which my lord drinketh, and by which indeed he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he overtook them, and he spoke to them these same words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And they said to him, Why saith my lord these words? Far be it from us that thy servants should do according to this thing:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Behold, the money which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again to thee from the land of Canaan: how then should we steal from thy lord’s house silver or gold?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">With whom soever of thy servants it shall be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord’s bond-men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he said, Now also let it be according to your words: he with whom it shall be found, shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Then they rent their clothes, and loaded every man his ass, and returned to the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house, (for he was yet there:) and they fell before him on the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Joseph said to them, What deed is this that ye have done? knew ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold we are my lord’s servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he said, Far be it from me that I should do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, go in peace to your father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then Judah came near to him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thy anger burn against thy servant; for thou art even as Pharaoh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And we said to my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one: and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And thou saidst to thy servants, Bring him down to me, that I may set my eyes upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And we said to my lord, The lad cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, his father would die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And thou saidst to thy servants, Except your youngest brother shall come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And it came to pass, when we came to thy servant, my father, we told him the words of my lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And our father said, Go again; buy us a little food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother shall be with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man’s face, except our youngest brother shall be with us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And thy servant my father, said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two sons:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And if ye take this also from me, and mischief shall befall him, ye will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Now therefore, when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad is not with us; (seeing that his life is bound up in the lad’s life)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants will bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father, with sorrow to the grave.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For thy servant became surety for the lad to my father, saying, If I bring him not to thee, then I will bear the blame to my father for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad, a bond-man to my lord; and let the lad return with his brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For how shall I return to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest perhaps I see the evil that shall come on my father.</p>
