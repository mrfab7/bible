<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Should this stream of words go unanswered and such a speaker be vindicated?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Should your babbling put others to silence? Will you scoff without rebuke?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">You have said, ‘My doctrine is sound, and I am pure in Your sight.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But if only God would speak and open His lips against you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom has two sides. Know then that God exacts from you less than your iniquity deserves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Can you fathom the deep things of God or discover the limits of the Almighty?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They are higher than the heavens—what can you do? They are deeper than Sheol—what can you know?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If He comes along to imprison you, or convenes a court, who can stop Him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Surely He knows the deceit of men. If He sees iniquity, does He not take note?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But a witless man can no more become wise than the colt of a wild donkey can be born a man!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">As for you, if you direct your heart and lift up your hands to Him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">if you put away the iniquity in your hand, and allow no injustice to dwell in your tents,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">then indeed you will lift up your face without blemish; you will stand firm and unafraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For you will forget your misery, recalling it only as waters gone by.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Your life will be brighter than noonday; its darkness will be like the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">You will be secure, because there is hope, and you will look around and lie down in safety.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">You will lie down without fear, and many will court your favor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But the eyes of the wicked will fail, and escape will elude them; they will hope for their last breath.”</p>
