  <verse number="1">Behold, the day of the LORD comes, and your spoil shall be divided in the middle of you.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the city.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations, as when he fought in the day of battle.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And his feet shall stand in that day on the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall split in the middle thereof toward the east and toward the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward the south.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And you shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal: yes, you shall flee, like as you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark:</verse>
  <verse number="7">But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening time it shall be light.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall it be.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one.</verse>
  <verse number="10">All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin’s gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel to the king’s winepresses.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And this shall be the plague with which the LORD will smite all the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh shall consume away while they stand on their feet, and their eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every one on the hand of his neighbor, and his hand shall rise up against the hand of his neighbor.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in these tents, as this plague.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And it shall be, that whoever will not come up of all the families of the earth to Jerusalem to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, even on them shall be no rain.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have no rain; there shall be the plague, with which the LORD will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.</verse>
  <verse number="19">This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.</verse>
  <verse number="20">In that day shall there be on the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD’s house shall be like the bowls before the altar.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Yes, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness to the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of hosts.</verse>
