  <verse number="1">Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the Passover, drew near.</verse>
  <verse number="2">The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put him to death, for they feared the people.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Satan entered into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered with the twelve.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He went away, and talked with the chief priests and captains about how he might deliver him to them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">They were glad, and agreed to give him money.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He consented, and sought an opportunity to deliver him to them in the absence of the multitude.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The day of unleavened bread came, on which the Passover must be sacrificed.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat.”</verse>
  <verse number="9">They said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare?”</verse>
  <verse number="10">He said to them, “Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Tell the master of the house, ‘The Teacher says to you, “Where is the guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?”’</verse>
  <verse number="12">He will show you a large, furnished upper room. Make preparations there.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">They went, found things as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
  <verse number="14">When the hour had come, he sat down with the twelve apostles.</verse>
  <verse number="15">He said to them, “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer,</verse>
  <verse number="16">for I tell you, I will no longer by any means eat of it until it is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.”</verse>
  <verse number="17">He received a cup, and when he had given thanks, he said, “Take this, and share it among yourselves,</verse>
  <verse number="18">for I tell you, I will not drink at all again from the fruit of the vine, until the Kingdom of God comes.”</verse>
  <verse number="19">He took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and gave to them, saying, “This is my body which is given for you. Do this in memory of me.”</verse>
  <verse number="20">Likewise, he took the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But behold, the hand of him who betrays me is with me on the table.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The Son of Man indeed goes, as it has been determined, but woe to that man through whom he is betrayed!”</verse>
  <verse number="23">They began to question among themselves, which of them it was who would do this thing.</verse>
  <verse number="24">There arose also a contention among them, which of them was considered to be greatest.</verse>
  <verse number="25">He said to them, “The kings of the nations lord it over them, and those who have authority over them are called ‘benefactors.’</verse>
  <verse number="26">But not so with you. But one who is the greater among you, let him become as the younger, and one who is governing, as one who serves.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For who is greater, one who sits at the table, or one who serves? Isn’t it he who sits at the table? But I am in the midst of you as one who serves.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But you are those who have continued with me in my trials.</verse>
  <verse number="29">I confer on you a kingdom, even as my Father conferred on me,</verse>
  <verse number="30">that you may eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. You will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”</verse>
  <verse number="31">The Lord said, “Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you, that he might sift you as wheat,</verse>
  <verse number="32">but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn’t fail. You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers.”</verse>
  <verse number="33">He said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!”</verse>
  <verse number="34">He said, “I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow today until you deny that you know me three times.”</verse>
  <verse number="35">He said to them, “When I sent you out without purse, and wallet, and shoes, did you lack anything?” They said, “Nothing.”</verse>
  <verse number="36">Then he said to them, “But now, whoever has a purse, let him take it, and likewise a wallet. Whoever has none, let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled in me: ‘He was counted with transgressors.’ For that which concerns me has an end.”</verse>
  <verse number="38">They said, “Lord, behold, here are two swords.” He said to them, “That is enough.”</verse>
  <verse number="39">He came out, and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives. His disciples also followed him.</verse>
  <verse number="40">When he was at the place, he said to them, “Pray that you don’t enter into temptation.”</verse>
  <verse number="41">He was withdrawn from them about a stone’s throw, and he knelt down and prayed,</verse>
  <verse number="42">saying, “Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done.”</verse>
  <verse number="43">An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Being in agony he prayed more earnestly. His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="45">When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples, and found them sleeping because of grief,</verse>
  <verse number="46">and said to them, “Why do you sleep? Rise and pray that you may not enter into temptation.”</verse>
  <verse number="47">While he was still speaking, behold, a multitude, and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He came near to Jesus to kiss him.</verse>
  <verse number="48">But Jesus said to him, “Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?”</verse>
  <verse number="49">When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said to him, “Lord, shall we strike with the sword?”</verse>
  <verse number="50">A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</verse>
  <verse number="51">But Jesus answered, “Let me at least do this”—and he touched his ear, and healed him.</verse>
  <verse number="52">Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and elders, who had come against him, “Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?</verse>
  <verse number="53">When I was with you in the temple daily, you didn’t stretch out your hands against me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.”</verse>
  <verse number="54">They seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter followed from a distance.</verse>
  <verse number="55">When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard, and had sat down together, Peter sat among them.</verse>
  <verse number="56">A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light, and looking intently at him, said, “This man also was with him.”</verse>
  <verse number="57">He denied Jesus, saying, “Woman, I don’t know him.”</verse>
  <verse number="58">After a little while someone else saw him, and said, “You also are one of them!” But Peter answered, “Man, I am not!”</verse>
  <verse number="59">After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying, “Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!”</verse>
  <verse number="60">But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking about!” Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.</verse>
  <verse number="61">The Lord turned, and looked at Peter. Then Peter remembered the Lord’s word, how he said to him, “Before the rooster crows you will deny me three times.”</verse>
  <verse number="62">He went out, and wept bitterly.</verse>
  <verse number="63">The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him.</verse>
  <verse number="64">Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?”</verse>
  <verse number="65">They spoke many other things against him, insulting him.</verse>
  <verse number="66">As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away into their council, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="67">“If you are the Christ, tell us.” But he said to them, “If I tell you, you won’t believe,</verse>
  <verse number="68">and if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go.</verse>
  <verse number="69">From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.”</verse>
  <verse number="70">They all said, “Are you then the Son of God?” He said to them, “You say it, because I am.”</verse>
  <verse number="71">They said, “Why do we need any more witness? For we ourselves have heard from his own mouth!”</verse>
