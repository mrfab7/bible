  <verse number="1">In that time Herod the tetrarch heard the report of Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; be was aroused from the dead; and for this, powers are energetic in him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For Herod, having seized John, bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife:</verse>
  <verse number="4">For John said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have her:</verse>
  <verse number="5">And wishing to kill him, he was afraid of the crowd, because they held John as a prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The festivities of Herod’s birthday being celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and pleased Herod.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Wherefore, with an oath, he agreed to give her whatever she should ask.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And having been urged on by her mother, Give me, she says, here upon a board, the head of John the Baptist.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the king was grieved: but for his oath, and those reclining together at the table, he ordered to be given.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And having sent, he beheaded John in the prison.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And his head was brought upon a board, and given to the girl, and she brought to her mother.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And his disciples having come near, took away the body, and interred it; and having come, they announced to Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Jesus having heard, withdrew from thence into a desert place apart: and the crowds, having heard, followed him on foot from the cities.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Jesus having come, saw a great crowd: and he felt compassion for them, and he cured their sick.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And being evening, his disciples came to him, saying, It is a desert place, and the time has passed already; loose the crowds, that, having gone into towns, they might purchase food for themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But Jesus said to them, They have no need to depart; give ye them to eat.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And they say to him, We have not here but five loaves, and two fishes.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he said, Bring them here to me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And having encouraged the crowds to recline upon the grass, and having taken the five loaves, and two fishes, and having looked up to heaven, he praised; and having broken, gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And they all ate, and were satisfied; and they took up the remaining of fragments, twelve baskets full.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they eating were five thousand men, besides women and children.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And quickly Jesus constrained his disciples to go into the ship, and to go before him to the other side, till he should loose the crowds.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And having loosed the crowds, he went up into a mount apart to pray: and being evening, he was there alone.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the ship was already in the midst of the sea, overcharged by waves: for the wind was contrary.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went out to them, walking upon the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the disciples seeing him walking upon the sea, were troubled, saying, It is an apparition; and they cried out for fear.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And quickly Jesus spake to them, saying, Take courage; I am; be not afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Peter having answered him, said, Lord, if thou art, encourage me to come upon the waters.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he said, Come. And Peter having gone down from the ship, walked upon the waters, to go to Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And seeing the wind strong, he was afraid: and beginning to sink, he cried out, Lord, save me.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And quickly Jesus, having stretched out the hand, laid hold of him, and says to him, O thou of little faith, for what didst thou doubt?</verse>
  <verse number="32">And having gone into the ship, the wind ceased.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And they in the ship, having come, worshipped him, saying, Thou art truly the Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And having passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the men of the place, having known him, sent into the whole country round about, and brought to him all those having evils:</verse>
  <verse number="36">And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were saved from danger.</verse>
