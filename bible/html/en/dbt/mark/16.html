<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the sabbath being [now] past, Mary of Magdala, and Mary the [mother] of James, and Salome, bought aromatic spices that they might come and embalm him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And very early on the first [day] of the week they come to the sepulchre, the sun having risen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they said to one another, Who shall roll us away the stone out of the door of the sepulchre?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And when they looked, they see that the stone has been rolled [away], for it was very great.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right, clothed in a white robe, and they were amazed and alarmed;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">but he says to them, Be not alarmed. Ye seek Jesus, the Nazarene, the crucified one. He is risen, he is not here; behold the place where they had put him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But go, tell his disciples and Peter, he goes before you into Galilee; there shall ye see him, as he said to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And they went out, and fled from the sepulchre. And trembling and excessive amazement possessed them, and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Now when he had risen very early, the first [day] of the week, he appeared first to Mary of Magdala, out of whom he had cast seven demons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">She went and brought word to those that had been with him, [who were] grieving and weeping.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And when these heard that he was alive and had been seen of her, they disbelieved [it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And after these things he was manifested in another form to two of them as they walked, going into the country;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and they went and brought word to the rest; neither did they believe them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Afterwards as they lay at table he was manifested to the eleven, and reproached [them with] their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who had seen him risen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he said to them, Go into all the world, and preach the glad tidings to all the creation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He that believes and is baptised shall be saved, and he that disbelieves shall be condemned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And these signs shall follow those that have believed: in my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">they shall take up serpents; and if they should drink any deadly thing it shall not injure them; they shall lay hands upon the infirm, and they shall be well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The Lord therefore, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat at the right hand of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And they, going forth, preached everywhere, the Lord working with [them], and confirming the word by the signs following upon [it].</p>
