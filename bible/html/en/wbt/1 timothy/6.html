<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Timothy" data-chapter="6" data-translation="Webster Bible Translation" data-translation-id="wbt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and his doctrine may not be blasphemed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If any man teacheth otherwise, and consenteth not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the doctrine which is according to godliness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, from which cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing gain to be godliness: from such withdraw thyself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But godliness with contentment is great gain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And having food and raiment, with these let us be content.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But they that will be rich, fall into temptation, and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some have coveted, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But thou, O man of God, flee from these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, to which thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">I give thee charge in the sight of God, who maketh alive all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate testified a good confession;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Which in his times he will show who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honor and power everlasting. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Which some professing, have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.</p>
