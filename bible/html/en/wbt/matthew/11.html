<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And it came to pass when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their cities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his disciples,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And said to him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Jesus answered and said to them, Go and show John again those things which ye hear and see:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And blessed is he to whom I shall not be the cause of his falling into sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And as they departed, Jesus began to say to the multitudes concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? a reed shaken with the wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kingsâ€™ houses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But what went ye out to see? A prophet? yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For this is he concerning whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Verily, I say to you, among them that are born of women, there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of heaven, is greater than he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And from the days of John the Baptist, until now, the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And if ye will receive it, this is Elijah who was to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like to children sitting in the markets, and calling to their fellows,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced; We have mourned to you, and ye have not lamented.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a demon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold, a man gluttonous, and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified by her children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Then he began to upbraid the cities in which most of his mighty works had been done, because they repented not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Woe to thee, Chorazin; woe to thee, Bethsaida: for if the mighty works which have been done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be brought down to hell: for if the mighty works which have been done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But I say to you, that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom, in the day of judgment, than for thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">All things are delivered to me by my Father; and no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Come to me, all ye that labor, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me: for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest to your souls.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</p>
