<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then there come to Jesus from Jerusalem Pharisees and scribes, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For God said, Honour thy father and thy mother: and, He that speaketh evil of father or mother, let him die the death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, That wherewith thou mightest have been profited by me is given to God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">he shall not honour his father. And ye have made void the word of God because of your tradition.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">This people honoureth me with their lips; But their heart is far from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But in vain do they worship me, Teaching as their doctrines the precepts of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he called to him the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man; but that which proceedeth out of the mouth, this defileth the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Then came the disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard this saying?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father planted not, shall be rooted up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Let them alone: they are blind guides. And if the blind guide the blind, both shall fall into a pit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Peter answered and said unto him, Declare unto us the parable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he said, Are ye also even yet without understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Perceive ye not, that whatsoever goeth into the mouth passeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But the things which proceed out of the mouth come forth out of the heart; and they defile the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, railings:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">these are the things which defile the man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Jesus went out thence, and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And behold, a Canaanitish woman came out from those borders, and cried, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But he answered and said, I was not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But she came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">But she said, Yea, Lord: for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it done unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was healed from that hour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Jesus departed thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and he went up into the mountain, and sat there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And there came unto him great multitudes, having with them the lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and they cast them down at his feet; and he healed them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb speaking, the maimed whole, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing: and they glorified the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And Jesus called unto him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days and have nothing to eat: and I would not send them away fasting, lest haply they faint in the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And the disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so many loaves in a desert place, as to fill so great a multitude?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">and he took the seven loaves and the fishes; and he gave thanks and brake, and gave to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up that which remained over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And he sent away the multitudes, and entered into the boat, and came into the borders of Magadan.</p>
