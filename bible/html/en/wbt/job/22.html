<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Can a man be profitable to God, as he that is wise may be profitable to himself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Is not thy wickedness great? and thy iniquities infinite?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for naught, and stripped the naked of their clothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withheld bread from the hungry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honorable man dwelt in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore snares are around thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Is not God in the hight of heaven? and behold the hight of the stars, how high they are!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Who were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflowed with a flood!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Who said to God, depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent deride them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: by this good shall come to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thy heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If thou shalt return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defense and thou shalt have plenty of silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Thou shalt make thy prayer to him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established to thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is exaltation; and he shall save the humble person.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thy hands.</p>
