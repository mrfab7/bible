<chapter book="1 Samuel" number="3" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And the boy Samuel ministered to Jehovah before Eli. And the word of Jehovah was rare in those days; a vision was not frequent.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And it came to pass at that time, when Eli lay in his place (now his eyes began to grow dim, he could not see),</verse>
  <verse number="3">and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel lay in the temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was,</verse>
  <verse number="4">that Jehovah called to Samuel. And he said, Here am I.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I did not call: lie down again. And he went and lay down.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Jehovah called again, Samuel! And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And he said, I did not call, my son: lie down again.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now Samuel did not yet know Jehovah, neither had the word of Jehovah yet been revealed to him.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Jehovah called again the third time, Samuel! And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me. And Eli perceived that Jehovah was calling the boy.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down; and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, Jehovah, for thy servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Jehovah came, and stood, and called as at the other times, Samuel, Samuel! And Samuel said, Speak, for thy servant heareth.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Jehovah said to Samuel, Behold, I do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</verse>
  <verse number="12">In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house; I will begin and make an end.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For I have declared to him that I will judge his house for ever, for the iniquity which he hath known: because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be expiated with sacrifice or oblation for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of Jehovah. And Samuel feared to declare the vision to Eli.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here am I.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he said, What is the word that he has spoken to thee? I pray thee, keep it not back from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou keep back anything from me of all the word that he spoke to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Samuel told him all the words, and kept nothing back from him. And he said, It is Jehovah: let him do what is good in his sight.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Samuel grew, and Jehovah was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And all Israel, from Dan even to Beer-sheba, knew that Samuel was established a prophet of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Jehovah appeared again at Shiloh; for Jehovah revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of Jehovah.</verse>
