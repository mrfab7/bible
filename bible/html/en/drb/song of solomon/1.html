<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth: for thy breasts are better than wine,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Smelling sweet of the best ointments. Thy name is as oil poured out: therefore young maidens have loved thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Draw me: we will run after thee to the odour of thy ointments. The king hath brought me into his storerooms: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, remembering thy breasts more than wine: the righteous love thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I am black but beautiful, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Cedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Do not consider me that I am brown, because the sun hath altered my colour: the sons of my mother have fought against me, they have made me the keeper in the vineyards: my vineyard I have not kept.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Shew me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou liest in the midday, lest I begin to wander after the flocks of thy companions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">If thou know not thyself, O fairest among women, go forth, and follow after the steps of the flocks, and feed thy kids beside the tents of the shepherds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">To my company of horsemen, in Pharao’s chariots, have I likened thee, O my love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thy cheeks are beautiful as the turtledove’s, thy neck as jewels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">We will make thee chains of gold, inlaid with silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">While the king was at his repose, my spikenard sent forth the odour thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A bundle of myrrh is my beloved to me, he shall abide between my breasts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">A cluster of cypress my love is to me, in the vineyards of Engaddi.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold thou art fair, O my love, behold thou art fair, thy eyes are as those of doves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Behold thou art fair, my beloved, and comely. Our bed is flourishing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The beams of our houses are of cedar, our rafters of cypress trees.</p>
