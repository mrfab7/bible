<p class="verse" data-verse="1">This is the record of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Abraham was the father of Isaac, Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Judah was the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Ram was the father of Amminadab, Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Salmon was the father of Boaz by Rahab, Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, Obed the father of Jesse,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and Jesse the father of David the king. Next: David was the father of Solomon by Uriah’s wife,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Solomon the father of Rehoboam, Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asa.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Uzziah was the father of Jotham, Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh, Manasseh the father of Amon, Amon the father of Josiah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and Josiah the father of Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">After the exile to Babylon: Jeconiah was the father of Shealtiel, Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Azor was the father of Zadok, Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Eliud was the father of Eleazar, Eleazar the father of Matthan, Matthan the father of Jacob,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">and Jacob the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">In all, then, there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the exile to Babylon, and fourteen from the exile to the Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged in marriage to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and was unwilling to disgrace her publicly, he resolved to divorce her quietly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But after he had pondered these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to embrace Mary as your wife, for the One conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">She will give birth to a Son, and you are to give Him the name Jesus, because He will save His people from their sins.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">“Behold, the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call Him Immanuel” (which means, “God with us”).</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and embraced Mary as his wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a Son. And he gave Him the name Jesus.</p>
