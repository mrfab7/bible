<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="12" translation="King James Bible" translationID="kjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now concerning spiritual [gifts], brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and [that] no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="9">To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="10">To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another [divers] kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:</verse>
  <verse number="11">But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also [is] Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether [we be] Jews or Gentiles, whether [we be] bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For the body is not one member, but many.</verse>
  <verse number="15">If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</verse>
  <verse number="16">And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</verse>
  <verse number="17">If the whole body [were] an eye, where [were] the hearing? If the whole [were] hearing, where [were] the smelling?</verse>
  <verse number="18">But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And if they were all one member, where [were] the body?</verse>
  <verse number="20">But now [are they] many members, yet but one body.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:</verse>
  <verse number="23">And those [members] of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely [parts] have more abundant comeliness.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For our comely [parts] have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that [part] which lacked:</verse>
  <verse number="25">That there should be no schism in the body; but [that] the members should have the same care one for another.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.</verse>
  <verse number="29">[Are] all apostles? [are] all prophets? [are] all teachers? [are] all workers of miracles?</verse>
  <verse number="30">Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?</verse>
  <verse number="31">But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.</verse>
