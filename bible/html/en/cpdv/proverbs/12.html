<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="12" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge. But whoever hates correction is unwise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Whoever is good shall draw grace from the Lord. But whoever trusts in his own thoughts acts impiously.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Man will not be made strong from impiety. And the root of the just shall not be moved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A diligent woman is a crown to her husband. And she who acts with confusion as to which things are worthy is decay to his bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The thoughts of the just are judgments. And the counsels of the impious are dishonest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The words of the impious lie in wait for blood. The mouth of the just shall free them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Turn from the impious, and they will not be. But the house of the just shall stand firm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">A man will be known by his doctrine. But whoever is vain and heartless will suffer contempt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Better is a pauper who has what he needs, than someone glorious and in need of bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The just one knows the lives of his beasts. But the inner most parts of the impious are cruel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Whoever works his land shall be satisfied with bread. But whoever continually pursues leisure is most foolish. Whoever is soothed by lingering over wine leaves behind contempt in his strongholds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The desire of the impious is the fortification of what is most wicked. But the root of the just shall prosper.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For the sins of the lips draw ruin to the evil. But the just shall escape from distress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">By the fruit of his own mouth, each one shall be filled with good things, and according to the works of his own hands, it will be distributed to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The way of the foolish is right in his own eyes. But whoever is wise listens to counsels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The senseless immediately reveals his anger. But whoever ignores injuries is clever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He is a sign of justice, who speaks what he knows. But whoever deceives is a dishonest witness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He who makes promises is also jabbed, as if with a sword, in conscience. But the tongue of the wise is reasonable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The lips of truth shall be steadfast forever. But a hasty witness readies a lying tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Deceit is in the heart of those who devise evils. But gladness follows those who take up counsels of peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Whatever may befall the just, it will not discourage him. But the impious will be filled with disasters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord. But whoever acts faithfully pleases him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">A resourceful man conceals knowledge. And the heart of the unwise provokes foolishness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The hand of the strong will rule. But anyone who is neglectful will pay tribute.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Grief in the heart of a man humbles him. And with a good word he shall be made glad.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He who ignores a loss for the sake of a friend is just. But the way of the impious will deceive them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The dishonest will not discover gain. But the substance of a man will be like precious gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">In the path of justice, there is life. But the devious way leads to death.</p>
