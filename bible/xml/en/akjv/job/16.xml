  <verse number="1">Then Job answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are you all.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldens you that you answer?</verse>
  <verse number="4">I also could speak as you do: if your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake my head at you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should assuage your grief.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Though I speak, my grief is not assuaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?</verse>
  <verse number="7">But now he has made me weary: you have made desolate all my company.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And you have filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me bears witness to my face.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He tears me in his wrath, who hates me: he gnashes on me with his teeth; my enemy sharpens his eyes on me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They have gaped on me with their mouth; they have smitten me on the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">God has delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I was at ease, but he has broken me asunder: he has also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.</verse>
  <verse number="13">His archers compass me round about, he splits my reins asunder, and does not spare; he pours out my gall on the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He breaks me with breach on breach, he runs on me like a giant.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="16">My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;</verse>
  <verse number="17">Not for any injustice in my hands: also my prayer is pure.</verse>
  <verse number="18">O earth, cover not you my blood, and let my cry have no place.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My friends scorn me: but my eye pours out tears to God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleads for his neighbor!</verse>
  <verse number="22">When a few years are come, then I shall go the way from where I shall not return.</verse>
