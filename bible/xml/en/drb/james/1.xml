  <verse number="1">James the servant of God, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</verse>
  <verse number="2">My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall into divers temptations;</verse>
  <verse number="3">Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And patience hath a perfect work; that you may be perfect and entire, failing in nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men abundantly, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="8">A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation:</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the rich, in his being low; because as the flower of the grass shall he pass away.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the sun rose with a burning heat, and parched the grass, and the flower thereof fell off, and the beauty of the shape thereof perished: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been proved, he shall receive a crown of life, which God hath promised to them that love him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God. For God is not a tempter of evils, and he tempteth no man.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. But sin, when it is completed, begetteth death.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Every best gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change, nor shadow of alteration.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth, that we might be some beginning of his creatures.</verse>
  <verse number="19">You know, my dearest brethren. And let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak, and slow to anger.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Wherefore casting away all uncleanness, and abundance of naughtiness, with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For if a man be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he shall be compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For he beheld himself, and went his way, and presently forgot what manner of man he was.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty, and hath continued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; this man shall be blessed in his deed.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And if any man think himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his own heart, this man’s religion is vain.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation: and to keep one’s self unspotted from this world.</verse>
