  <verse number="1">So then, what more is the Jew, or what is the usefulness of circumcision?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Much in every way: First of all, certainly, because the eloquence of God was entrusted to them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But what if some of them have not believed? Shall their unbelief nullify the faith of God? Let it not be so!</verse>
  <verse number="4">For God is truthful, but every man is deceitful; just as it was written: “Therefore, you are justified in your words, and you will prevail when you give judgment.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">But if even our injustice points to the justice of God, what shall we say? Could God be unfair for inflicting wrath?</verse>
  <verse number="6">(I am speaking in human terms.) Let it not be so! Otherwise, how would God judge this world?</verse>
  <verse number="7">For if the truth of God has abounded, through my falseness, unto his glory, why should I still be judged as such a sinner?</verse>
  <verse number="8">And should we not do evil, so that good may result? For so we have been slandered, and so some have claimed we said; their condemnation is just.</verse>
  <verse number="9">What is next? Should we try to excel ahead of them? By no means! For we have accused all Jews and Greeks to be under sin,</verse>
  <verse number="10">just as it was written: “There is no one who is just.</verse>
  <verse number="11">There is no one who understands. There is no one who seeks God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">All have gone astray; together they have become useless. There is no one who does good; there is not even one.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Their throat is an open sepulcher. With their tongues, they have been acting deceitfully. The venom of asps is under their lips.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Their feet are swift to shed blood.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Grief and unhappiness are in their ways.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the way of peace they have not known.</verse>
  <verse number="18">There is no fear of God before their eyes.”</verse>
  <verse number="19">But we know that whatever the law speaks, it speaks to those who are in the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the entire world may be subject to God.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For in his presence no flesh shall be justified by the works of the law. For knowledge of sin is through the law.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But now, without the law, the justice of God, to which the law and the prophets have testified, has been made manifest.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the justice of God, though the faith of Jesus Christ, is in all those and over all those who believe in him. For there is no distinction.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For all have sinned and all are in need of the glory of God.</verse>
  <verse number="24">We have been justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="25">whom God has offered as a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to reveal his justice for the remission of the former offenses,</verse>
  <verse number="26">and by the forbearance of God, to reveal his justice in this time, so that he himself might be both the Just One and the Justifier of anyone who is of the faith of Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="27">So then, where is your self-exaltation? It is excluded. Through what law? That of works? No, but rather through the law of faith.</verse>
  <verse number="28">For we judge a man to be justified by faith, without the works of the law.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Is God of the Jews only and not also of the Gentiles? On the contrary, of the Gentiles also.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For One is the God who justifies circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Are we then destroying the law through faith? Let it not be so! Instead, we are making the law stand.</verse>
