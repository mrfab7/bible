<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="23" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When thou shalt sit to eat with a prince, consider diligently what is set before thy face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And put a knife to thy throat, if it be so that thou have thy soul in thy own power.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Be not desirous of his meats, in which is the bread of deceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Labour not to be rich: but set bounds to thy prudence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Lift not up thy eyes to riches which thou canst not have: because they shall make themselves wings like those of an eagle, and shall fly towards heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Eat not with an envious man, and desire not his meats:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Because like a soothsayer, and diviner, he thinketh that which he knoweth not. Eat and drink, will he say to thee: and his mind is not with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The meats which thou hadst eaten, thou shalt vomit up: and shalt loose thy beautiful words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Speak not in the ears of fools: because they will despise the instruction of thy speech.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Touch not the bounds of little ones: and enter not into the field of the fatherless:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For their near kinsman is strong: and he will judge their cause against thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let thy heart apply itself to instruction: and thy ears to words of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Withhold not correction from a child: for if thou strike him with the rod, he shall not die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and deliver his soul from hell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">My son, if thy mind be wise, my heart shall rejoice with thee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips shall speak what is right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Let not thy heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the Lord all the day long:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Because thou shalt have hope in the latter end, and thy expectation shall not be taken away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Hear thou, my son, and be wise: and guide thy mind in the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Be not in the feasts of great drinkers, nor in their revellings, who contribute flesh to eat:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Because they that give themselves to drinking, and that club together shall be consumed; and drowsiness shall be clothed with rags.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Hearken to thy father, that beget thee: and despise not thy mother when she is old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Buy truth, and do not sell wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The father of the just rejoiceth greatly: he that hath begotten a wise son, shall have joy in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Let thy father, and thy mother be joyful, and let her rejoice that bore thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">My son, give me thy heart: and let thy eyes keep my ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For a harlot is a deep ditch: and a strange woman is a narrow pit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">She lieth in wait in the way as a robber, and him whom she shall see unwary, she will kill.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Who hath woe? whose father hath woe? who hath contentions? who falls into pits? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Surely they that pass their time in wine, and study to drink of their cups.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Look not upon the wine when it is yellow, when the colour thereof shineth in the glass: it goeth in pleasantly,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">But in the end, it will bite like a snake, and will spread abroad poison like a basilisk.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Thy eyes shall behold strange women, and thy heart shall utter perverse things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And thou shalt be as one sleeping in the midst of the sea, and as a pilot fast asleep, when the stern is lost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And thou shalt say: They have beaten me, but I was not sensible of pain: they drew me, and I felt not: when shall I awake, and find wine again?</p>
