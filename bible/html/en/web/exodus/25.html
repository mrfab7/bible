<p class="verse" data-verse="21">You shall put the mercy seat on top of the ark, and in the ark you shall put the testimony that I will give you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">There I will meet with you, and I will tell you from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are on the ark of the testimony, all that I command you for the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">“You shall make a table of acacia wood. Two cubits shall be its length, and a cubit its breadth, and one and a half cubits its height.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="31">“You shall make a lampstand of pure gold. Of hammered work shall the lampstand be made, even its base, its shaft, its cups, its buds, and its flowers, shall be of one piece with it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">There shall be six branches going out of its sides: three branches of the lampstand out of its one side, and three branches of the lampstand out of its other side;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">three cups made like almond blossoms in one branch, a bud and a flower; and three cups made like almond blossoms in the other branch, a bud and a flower, so for the six branches going out of the lampstand;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">and in the lampstand four cups made like almond blossoms, its buds and its flowers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">and a bud under two branches of one piece with it, and a bud under two branches of one piece with it, and a bud under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of the lampstand.</p>
