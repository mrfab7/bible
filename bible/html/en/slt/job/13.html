<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Behold all mine eye saw, and mine ear heard, and it will understand for it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">According to your knowledge I knew also: I fall not more than you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But I will speak to the Almighty; I shall delight to plead before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And on the contrary, ye devise falsehood; physicians all of you for nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who will give silence? Ye shall be silent, and it shall be to you for wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Hear now my proof, and attend to the pleadings of my lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Will ye speak wickedness for God? and will ye speak deceit to him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Will ye accept his face? will ye contend for God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Is it good that he shall search you out? or as he mocking against a man; will ye mock against him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Reproving, he will reprove you if in secret ye lift up faces.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Shall not his majesty make you afraid? and his terror fall upon you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Your remembrances being likened to ashes, your backs to backs of clay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Be silent from me and I will speak what shall pass upon me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For what shall I lift up my flesh in my teeth, and shall I put my soul in my hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If he shall slay me shall I not hope? only I will prove my ways to his face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Also he is to me for salvation for a profane one shall not come before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Hearing, hear ye my words, and my declaration in your ears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Behold now I set in order judgment; I knew that I shall be justified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Who is he will contend with me? for now shall I be silent and expire;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Only two things thou wilt not do with me: then I shall not hide from thy face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Remove thy hand far from me, and thy terror shall not make me afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And call and I will answer, and I shall speak, and turn thou to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">How many iniquities and sins to me? make known to me my transgression and my sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Why wilt thou hide thy face, and reckon me for an enemy to thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Wilt thou terrify the scattered leaf? and wilt thou pursue the dry straw?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For thou wilt write bitter things against me; and thou wilt give me to inherit the iniquities of my youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And thou wilt set my feet in the stocks, and thou wilt watch all my paths; thou wilt dig round the roots of my feet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And he as rottenness will fall away; as a garment the moth ate it.</p>
