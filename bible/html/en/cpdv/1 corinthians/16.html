<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="16" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now concerning the collections which are made for the saints: just as I have arranged for the churches of Galatia, so should it also be done with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">On the first day of the week, the Sabbath, let each one of you take from himself, setting aside what will be well-pleasing to him, so that when I arrive, the collections will not have to be made then.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And when I am present, whomever you shall approve through letters, these I shall send to bear your gifts to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And if it is fitting for me to go too, they shall go with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Now I will visit you after I have passed through Macedonia. For I will pass through Macedonia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And perhaps I will stay with you, and even spend the winter, so that you may lead me on my way, whenever I depart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For I am not willing to see you now only in passing, since I hope that I may remain with you for some length of time, if the Lord permits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But I must remain at Ephesus, even until Pentecost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For a door, great and unavoidable, has opened to me, as well as many adversaries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Now if Timothy arrives, see to it that he may be among you without fear. For he is doing the work of the Lord, just as I also do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Therefore, let no one despise him. Instead, lead him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me. For I am awaiting him with the brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But concerning our brother, Apollo, I am letting you know that I pleaded with him greatly to go to you with the brothers, and clearly it was not his will to go at this time. But he will arrive when there is a space of time for him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Be vigilant. Stand with faith. Act manfully and be strengthened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Let all that is yours be immersed in charity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And I beg you, brothers: You know the house of Stephanus, and of Fortunatus, and of Achaicus, that they are the first-fruits of Achaia, and that they have dedicated themselves to the ministry of the saints.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">So you should be subject also to persons such as this, as well as to all who are cooperating and working with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Now I rejoice in the presence of Stephanus and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because what was lacking in you, they have supplied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore, recognize persons such as this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you greatly in the Lord, with the church of their household, where I also am a guest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">This is a greeting from my own hand, Paul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">If anyone does not love our Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema! Maran Atha.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">My charity is with all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
