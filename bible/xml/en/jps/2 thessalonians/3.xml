<chapter book="2 Thessalonians" number="3" translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" translationID="jps" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Finally, brethren, pray for us, asking that the Lord’s Message may be spread rapidly and its glory be displayed, as it was displayed among you;</verse>
  <verse number="2">and that we may be delivered from wrong-headed and wicked men; for it is not everybody who has faith.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But the Lord is faithful, and He will make you stedfast and will guard you from the Evil one.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And we have confidence in the Lord in regard to you that you are doing, and will do, what we command.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And may the Lord guide your hearts into the love of God and into the patience of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But, by the authority of the Lord, we command you, brethren, to stand aloof from every brother whose life is disorderly and not in accordance with the teaching which all received from us.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For you yourselves know that it is your duty to follow our example. There was no disorder in our lives among you,</verse>
  <verse number="8">nor did we eat any one’s bread without paying for it, but we laboured and toiled, working hard night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you.</verse>
  <verse number="9">This was not because we had not a claim upon you, but it arose from a desire to set you an example—for you to imitate us.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For even when we were with you, we laid down this rule for you: “If a man does not choose to work, neither shall he eat.”</verse>
  <verse number="11">For we hear that there are some of you who live disorderly lives and are mere idle busybodies.</verse>
  <verse number="12">To persons of that sort our injunction—and our command by the authority of the Lord Jesus Christ—is that they are to work quietly and eat their own honestly-earned bread.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But you, brethren, must not grow weary in the path of duty;</verse>
  <verse number="14">and if any one refuses to obey these our written instructions, mark that man and hold no communication with him—so that he may be made to feel ashamed.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And yet do not regard him as an enemy, but caution him as a brother.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every sense. The Lord be with you all.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I Paul add the greeting with my own hand, which is the credential in every letter of mine.</verse>
  <verse number="18">This is my handwriting. May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.</verse>
