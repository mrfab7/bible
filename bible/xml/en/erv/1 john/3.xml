<chapter book="1 John" number="3" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God: and such we are. For this cause the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Beloved, now are we children of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be. We know that, if he shall be manifested, we shall be like him; for we shall see him even as he is.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And every one that hath this hope set on him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Every one that doeth sin doeth also lawlessness: and sin is lawlessness.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And ye know that he was manifested to take away sins; and in him is no sin.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither knoweth him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">My little children, let no man lead you astray: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous:</verse>
  <verse number="8">he that doeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Whosoever is begotten of God doeth no sin, because his seed abideth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is begotten of God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For this is the message which ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another:</verse>
  <verse number="12">not as Cain was of the evil one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Marvel not, brethren, if the world hateth you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not abideth in death.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Hereby know we love, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But whoso hath the world’s goods, and beholdeth his brother in need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how doth the love of God abide in him?</verse>
  <verse number="18">My little children, let us not love in word, neither with the tongue; but in deed and truth.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Hereby shall we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our heart before him,</verse>
  <verse number="20">whereinsoever our heart condemn us; because God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have boldness toward God;</verse>
  <verse number="22">and whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do the things that are pleasing in his sight.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, even as he gave us commandment.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And he that keepeth his commandments abideth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he gave us.</verse>
