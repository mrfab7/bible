<div class="chapter" data-book="Philippians" data-chapter="1" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul and Timothy, the servants of Jesus Christ; to all the saints in Christ Jesus, who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Grace be unto you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I give thanks to my God in every remembrance of you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Always in all my prayers making supplication for you all, with joy;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For your communication in the gospel of Christ from the first day until now.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Being confident of this very thing, that he, who hath begun a good work in you, will perfect it unto the day of Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">As it is meet for me to think this for you all, for that I have you in my heart; and that in my bands, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And this I pray, that your charity may more and more abound in knowledge, and in all understanding:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">That you may approve the better things, that you may be sincere and without offence unto the day of Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Filled with the fruit of justice, through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now, brethren, I desire you should know, that the things which have happened to me, have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">So that my bands are made manifest in Christ, in all the court, and in all other places;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And many of the brethren in the Lord, growing confident by my bands, are much more bold to speak the word of God without fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Some indeed, even out of envy and contention; but some also for good will preach Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Some out of charity, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And some out of contention preach Christ not sincerely: supposing that they raise affliction to my bands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But what then? So that by all means, whether by occasion, or by truth, Christ be preached: in this also I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For I know that this shall fall out to me unto salvation, through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">According to my expectation and hope; that in nothing I shall be confounded, but with all confidence, as always, so now also shall Christ be magnified in my body, wither it be by life, or by death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For to me, to live is Christ; and to die is gain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And if to live in the flesh, that is to me the fruit of labour, and what I shall choose I know not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But I am straitened between two: having a desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ, a thing by far the better.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But to abide still in the flesh, is needful for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, and continue with you all, for your furtherance and joy of faith:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">That your rejoicing may abound in Christ Jesus for me, by my coming to you again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Only let your conversation be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you, or, being absent, may hear of you, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind labouring together for the faith of the gospel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And in nothing be ye terrified by the adversaries: which to them is a cause of perdition, but to you of salvation, and this from God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For unto you it is given for Christ, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Having the same conflict as that which you have seen in me, and now have heard of me.</p>
