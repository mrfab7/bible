  <verse number="1">And David will say, This house itself of Jehovah God, and this the altar for burnt-offering to Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And David will say to assemble the strangers which are in the land of Israel; and he will set up hewers of stone to hew out hewn stones to build the house of God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And iron for abundance for nails for the doors of the gates, and for the junctions, David prepared; and brass for abundance no weight;</verse>
  <verse number="4">And cedar woods to no number: for the Zidonians and the Tyrians brought cedar woods for multitude to David.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And David will say, Solomon my son a youth and tender, and the house to be built for Jehovah to be great for going up for a name and for glory to all the lands: I will now prepare for it. And David will prepare for abundance before his death.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he will call for Solomon his son, and he will command him to build a house to Jehovah God of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And David will say to Solomon his son, I, it was with my heart to build a house to the name of Jehovah my God.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the word of Jehovah will be upon me, saying, Thou didst pour out blood for abundance, and didst make great wars: thou shalt not build a house for my name, for thou didst pour out many bloods in the earth before me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Behold, a son being born to thee, he shall be a man of rest; and I caused rest to him from all his enemies from round about: for Solomon shall be his name, and I will give peace and quiet upon Israel in his days.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He shall build a house to my name; and he shall be to me for son, and I to him for father; and I prepared the throne of his kingdom over Israel even to forever.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Now, my son, Jehovah will be with thee; and prosper thou and build the house of Jehovah thy God as he spake concerning thee.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Surely Jehovah will give to thee wisdom and understanding, and he will command thee concerning Israel, and to watch the law of Jehovah thy God.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then thou shalt prosper if thou shalt watch to do the laws and the judgments which Jehovah commanded Moses concerning Israel: be strong and be active; thou shalt not fear and thou shalt not be terrified.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And behold in my affliction I prepared for the house of Jehovah, gold, a hundred thousand talents, and silver, a thousand thousand talents; and for brass and for iron, no weight; for it was for abundance: and woods and stones I prepared, and upon them thou wilt add.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And with thee for abundance, they doing the work, hewers and workmen of stone and wood, and all the wise for all the work.</verse>
  <verse number="16">To gold, to silver, and to brass, and to iron, no number. Arise and do, and Jehovah will be with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And David will command to all the chiefs of Israel for help to Solomon his son:</verse>
  <verse number="18">Is not Jehovah your God with you? and he caused rest to you from round about? for he gave into my hand the inhabitants of the land; and the land was subdued before Jehovah, and before his people.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Now ye shall give your heart and your soul to seek to Jehovah your God; and arise ye and build the holy place of Jehovah God to bring the ark of the covenant of Jehovah and the holy vessels of God, to the house being built to the name of Jehovah.</verse>
