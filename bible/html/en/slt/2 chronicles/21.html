<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And to him brethren, sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and Shephatiah: all these sons of Jehoshaphat king of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And their father will give to them many gifts to silver and to gold, and to precious things, with fortified cities in Judah: and he gave the kingdom to Jehoram, for he was the first-born.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The son of thirty and two years was Jehoram in his reigning, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he will go in the way of the kings of Israel as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was to him for wife: and he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And Jehovah would not destroy the house of David, for sake of the covenant which he cut out to David, and as he said to give to him a light and to his sons all the days.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Edom will revolt from under the hand of Judah, even to this day. Then Libnah will revolt in that time from under his hand, for he forsook Jehovah the God of his fathers.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Behold, Jehovah smote a great stroke upon thy people, and upon thy sons, and upon thy wives, and upon all thy possessions:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And thou in great sicknesses in disease of thy bowels, till thy bowels shall come forth from the sickness days upon days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Jehovah will rouse up against Jehoram the spirit of the rovers and the Arabians which were upon the hand of the Cushitea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And they will come up into Judah and rend it, and carry away captive all the possessions being found at the kingâ€™s house, and also his sons and his wives; and there was not left to him a son except Jehoahaz the young of his sons.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And it will be to days from days, and according to the time of the going forth of the end to the days the second time, his bowels will go forth with his sickness: and he will die with evil sicknesses. And his people made not to him a burning as the burning of his fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The son of thirty and two was he in his reigning, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem; and he will go without desire: and they will bury him in the city of David, and not in the graves of the kings.</p>
