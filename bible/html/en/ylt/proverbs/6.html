<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="6" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son! if thou hast been surety for thy friend, Hast stricken for a stranger thy hand,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hast been snared with sayings of thy mouth, Hast been captured with sayings of thy mouth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Do this now, my son, and be delivered, For thou hast come into the hand of thy friend. Go, trample on thyself, and strengthen thy friend,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Give not sleep to thine eyes, And slumber to thine eyelids,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Be delivered as a roe from the hand, And as a bird from the hand of a fowler.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Go unto the ant, O slothful one, See her ways and be wise;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Which hath not captain, overseer, and ruler,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">She doth prepare in summer her bread, She hath gathered in harvest her food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Till when, O slothful one, dost thou lie? When dost thou arise from thy sleep?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A little sleep, a little slumber, A little clasping of the hands to rest,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And thy poverty hath come as a traveller, And thy want as an armed man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A man of worthlessness, a man of iniquity, Walking with perverseness of mouth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, Directing with his fingers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Frowardness is in his heart, devising evil at all times, Contentions he sendeth forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Therefore suddenly cometh his calamity, Instantly he is broken—and no healing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">These six hath Jehovah hated, Yea, seven are abominations to His soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Eyes high—tongues false—And hands shedding innocent blood—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">A heart devising thoughts of vanity—Feet hasting to run to evil—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A false witness who doth breathe out lies—And one sending forth contentions between brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Keep, my son, the command of thy father, And leave not the law of thy mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Bind them on thy heart continually, Tie them on thy neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">In thy going up and down, it leadeth thee, In thy lying down, it watcheth over thee, And thou hast awaked—it talketh with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For a lamp is the command, And the law a light, And a way of life are reproofs of instruction,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">To preserve thee from an evil woman, From the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Desire not her beauty in thy heart, And let her not take thee with her eyelids.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For a harlot consumeth unto a cake of bread, And an adulteress the precious soul hunteth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Doth a man take fire into his bosom, And are his garments not burnt?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Doth a man walk on the hot coals, And are his feet not scorched?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">So is he who hath gone in unto the wife of his neighbour, None who doth touch her is innocent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">They do not despise the thief, When he stealeth to fill his soul when he is hungry,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And being found he repayeth sevenfold, All the substance of his house he giveth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He who committeth adultery with a woman lacketh heart, He is destroying his soul who doth it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">A stroke and shame he doth find, And his reproach is not wiped away,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For jealousy is the fury of a man, And he doth not spare in a day of vengeance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">He accepteth not the appearance of any atonement, Yea, he doth not consent, Though thou dost multiply bribes!</p>
