<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If the clouds are full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree falleth towards the south, or towards the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor the structure of the parts of conception in her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thy hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun:</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the sight of thy eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.</p>
