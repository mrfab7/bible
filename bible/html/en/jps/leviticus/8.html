<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and the bullock of the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and assemble thou all the congregation at the door of the tent of meeting.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the congregation was assembled at the door of the tent of meeting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Moses said unto the congregation: ‘This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded to be done.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he put upon him the tunic, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the skilfully woven band of the ephod, and bound it unto him therewith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he placed the breastplate upon him; and in the breastplate he put the Urim and the Thummim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he set the mitre upon his head; and upon the mitre, in front, did he set the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that was therein, and sanctified them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the laver and its base, to sanctify them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and clothed them with tunics, and girded them with girdles, and bound head-tires upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And the bullock of the sin-offering was brought; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin-offering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And when it was slain, Moses took the blood, and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured out the remaining blood at the base of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement for it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses made it smoke upon the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But the bullock, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung, were burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the ram of the burnt-offering was presented; and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And when it was killed, Moses dashed the blood against the altar round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And when the ram was cut into its pieces, Moses made the head, and the pieces, and the suet smoke.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And when the inwards and the legs were washed with water, Moses made the whole ram smoke upon the altar; it was a burnt-offering for a sweet savour; it was an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the other ram was presented, the ram of consecration, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And when it was slain, Moses took of the blood thereof, and put it upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Aaron’s sons were brought, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot; and Moses dashed the blood against the altar round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And he took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right thigh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and upon the right thigh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And he put the whole upon the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and waved them for a wave-offering before the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And Moses took them from off their hands, and made them smoke on the altar upon the burnt-offering; they were a consecration-offering for a sweet savour; it was an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave-offering before the LORD; it was Moses’ portion of the ram of consecration; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons’ garments with him, and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons: ‘Boil the flesh at the door of the tent of meeting; and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying: Aaron and his sons shall eat it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And ye shall not go out from the door of the tent of meeting seven days, until the days of your consecration be fulfilled; for He shall consecrate you seven days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">As hath been done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to make atonement for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And at the door of the tent of meeting shall ye abide day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not; for so I am commanded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And Aaron and his sons did all the things which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.</p>
