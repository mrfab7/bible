<chapter book="Job" number="41" translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" translationID="jps" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fish-hook? Or press down his tongue with a cord?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Canst thou put a ring into his nose? Or bore his jaw through with a hook?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Will he make many supplications unto thee? Or will he speak soft words unto thee?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Will he make a covenant with thee, That thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Will the bands of fishermen make a banquet of him? Will they part him among the merchants?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? Or his head with fish-spears?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Lay thy hand upon him; Think upon the battle, thou wilt do so no more.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Behold, the hope of him is in vain; Shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?</verse>
  <verse number="10">None is so fierce that dare stir him up; Who then is able to stand before Me?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Who hath given Me anything beforehand, that I should repay him? Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is Mine.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Would I keep silence concerning his boastings, Or his proud talk, or his fair array of words?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who can uncover the face of his garment? Who shall come within his double bridle?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror.</verse>
  <verse number="15">His scales are his pride, Shut up together as with a close seal.</verse>
  <verse number="16">One is so near to another, That no air can come between them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They are joined one to another; They stick together, that they cannot be sundered.</verse>
  <verse number="18">His sneezings flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Out of his mouth go burning torches, And sparks of fire leap forth.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, As out of a seething pot and burning rushes.</verse>
  <verse number="21">His breath kindleth coals, And a flame goeth out of his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="22">In his neck abideth strength, And dismay danceth before him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The flakes of his flesh are joined together; They are firm upon him; they cannot be moved.</verse>
  <verse number="24">His heart is as firm as a stone; Yea, firm as the nether millstone.</verse>
  <verse number="25">When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid; By reason of despair they are beside themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="26">If one lay at him with the sword, it will not hold; Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.</verse>
  <verse number="27">He esteemeth iron as straw, And brass as rotten wood.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The arrow cannot make him flee; Slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Clubs are accounted as stubble; He laugheth at the rattling of the javelin.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Sharpest potsherds are under him; He spreadeth a threshing-sledge upon the mire.</verse>
  <verse number="31">He maketh the deep to boil like a pot; He maketh the sea like a seething mixture.</verse>
  <verse number="32">He maketh a path to shine after him; One would think the deep to be hoary.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Upon earth there is not his like Who is made to be fearless.</verse>
  <verse number="34">He looketh at all high things; He is king over all the proud beasts.</verse>
