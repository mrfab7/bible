  <verse number="1">Now tax collectors and sinners were drawing near to him, so that they might listen to him.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying, “This one accepts sinners and eats with them.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he told this parable to them, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="4">“What man among you, who has one hundred sheep, and if he will have lost one of them, would not leave the ninety-nine in the desert and go after the one whom he had lost, until he finds it?</verse>
  <verse number="5">And when he has found it, he places it on his shoulders, rejoicing.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And returning home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them: ‘Congratulate me! For I have found my sheep, which had been lost.’</verse>
  <verse number="7">I say to you, that there will be so much more joy in heaven over one sinner repenting, than over the ninety-nine just, who do not need to repent.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Or what woman, having ten drachmas, if she will have lost one drachma, would not light a candle, and sweep the house, and diligently search until she finds it?</verse>
  <verse number="9">And when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying: ‘Rejoice with me! For I have found the drachma, which I had lost.’</verse>
  <verse number="10">So I say to you, there will be joy before the Angels of God over even one sinner who is repentant.”</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he said: “A certain man had two sons.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the younger of them said to the father, ‘Father, give me the portion of your estate which would go to me.’ And he divided the estate between them.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And after not many days, the younger son, gathering it all together, set out on a long journey to a distant region. And there, he dissipated his substance, living in luxury.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And after he had consumed it all, a great famine occurred in that region, and he began to be in need.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he went and attached himself to one of the citizens of that region. And he sent him to his farm, in order to feed the swine.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he wanted to fill his belly with the scraps that the swine ate. But no one would give it to him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And returning to his senses, he said: ‘How many hired hands in my father’s house have abundant bread, while I perish here in famine!</verse>
  <verse number="18">I shall rise up and go to my father, and I will say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">I am not worthy to be called your son. Make me one of your hired hands.’</verse>
  <verse number="20">And rising up, he went to his father. But while he was still at a distance, his father saw him, and he was moved with compassion, and running to him, he fell upon his neck and kissed him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the son said to him: ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. Now I am not worthy to be called your son.’</verse>
  <verse number="22">But the father said to his servants: ‘Quickly! Bring out the best robe, and clothe him with it. And put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And bring the fatted calf here, and kill it. And let us eat and hold a feast.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For this son of mine was dead, and has revived; he was lost, and is found.’ And they began to feast.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But his elder son was in the field. And when he returned and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And he called one of the servants, and he questioned him as to what these things meant.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he said to him: ‘Your brother has returned, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him safely.’</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then he became indignant, and he was unwilling to enter. Therefore, his father, going out, began to plead with him.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And in response, he said to his father: ‘Behold, I have been serving you for so many years. And I have never transgressed your commandment. And yet, you have never given me even a young goat, so that I might feast with my friends.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Yet after this son of yours returned, who has devoured his substance with loose women, you have killed the fatted calf for him.’</verse>
  <verse number="31">But he said to him: ‘Son, you are with me always, and all that I have is yours.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But it was necessary to feast and to rejoice. For this brother of yours was dead, and has revived; he was lost, and is found.’ ”</verse>
