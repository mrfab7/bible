<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son! to my wisdom give attention, To mine understanding incline thine ear,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">To observe thoughtfulness, And knowledge do thy lips keep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And smoother than oil is her mouth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And her latter end is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a sword with mouths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Her feet are going down to death, Sheol do her steps take hold of.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The path of life—lest thou ponder, Moved have her paths—thou knowest not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And now, ye sons, hearken to me, And turn not from sayings of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Keep far from off her thy way, And come not near unto the opening of her house,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Lest thou give to others thy honour, And thy years to the fierce,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Lest strangers be filled with thy power, And thy labours in the house of a stranger,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And thou hast howled in thy latter end, In the consumption of thy flesh and thy food,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And hast said, ‘How have I hated instruction, And reproof hath my heart despised,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And I have not hearkened to the voice of my directors, And to my teachers have not inclined mine ear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">As a little thing I have been all evil, In the midst of an assembly and a company.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Drink waters out of thine own cistern, Even flowing ones out of thine own well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let thy fountains be scattered abroad, In broad places rivulets of waters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Let them be to thee for thyself, And not to strangers with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Let thy fountain be blessed, And rejoice because of the wife of thy youth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A hind of loves, and a roe of grace! Let her loves satisfy thee at all times, In her love magnify thyself continually.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And why dost thou magnify thyself, My son, with a stranger? And embrace the bosom of a strange woman?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For over-against the eyes of Jehovah are the ways of each, And all his paths He is pondering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">His own iniquities do capture the wicked, And with the ropes of his sin he is holden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He dieth without instruction, And in the abundance of his folly magnifieth himself!</p>
