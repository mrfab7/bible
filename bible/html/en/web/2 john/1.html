<div class="chapter" data-book="2 John" data-chapter="1" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The elder, to the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in truth; and not I only, but also all those who know the truth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">for the truth’s sake, which remains in us, and it will be with us forever:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I rejoice greatly that I have found some of your children walking in truth, even as we have been commanded by the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Now I beg you, dear lady, not as though I wrote to you a new commandment, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">This is love, that we should walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, even as you heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who don’t confess that Jesus Christ came in the flesh. This is the deceiver and the Antichrist.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Watch yourselves, that we don’t lose the things which we have accomplished, but that we receive a full reward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Whoever transgresses and doesn’t remain in the teaching of Christ, doesn’t have God. He who remains in the teaching, the same has both the Father and the Son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If anyone comes to you, and doesn’t bring this teaching, don’t receive him into your house, and don’t welcome him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">for he who welcomes him participates in his evil works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Having many things to write to you, I don’t want to do so with paper and ink, but I hope to come to you, and to speak face to face, that our joy may be made full.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The children of your chosen sister greet you. Amen.</p>
