  <verse number="1">Then said he to the disciples, It is impossible but that offenses will come: but woe to him, through whom they come!</verse>
  <verse number="2">It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Take heed to yourselves: If your brother trespass against you, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And if he trespass against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to you, saying, I repent; you shall forgive him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the Lord said, If you had faith as a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this sycamine tree, Be you plucked up by the root, and be you planted in the sea; and it should obey you.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say to him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?</verse>
  <verse number="8">And will not rather say to him, Make ready with which I may sup, and gird yourself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward you shall eat and drink?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.</verse>
  <verse number="10">So likewise you, when you shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the middle of Samaria and Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:</verse>
  <verse number="13">And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And when he saw them, he said to them, Go show yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,</verse>
  <verse number="16">And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?</verse>
  <verse number="18">There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And he said to him, Arise, go your way: your faith has made you whole.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God comes not with observation:</verse>
  <verse number="21">Neither shall they say, See here! or, see there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he said to the disciples, The days will come, when you shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and you shall not see it.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For as the lightning, that lightens out of the one part under heaven, shines to the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.</verse>
  <verse number="27">They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;</verse>
  <verse number="29">But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.</verse>
  <verse number="31">In that day, he which shall be on the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Remember Lot’s wife.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Whoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.</verse>
  <verse number="34">I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And they answered and said to him, Where, Lord? And he said to them, Wherever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together.</verse>
