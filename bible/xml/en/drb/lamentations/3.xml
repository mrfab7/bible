  <verse number="1">Aleph. I am the man that see my poverty by the rod of his indignation.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Aleph. He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, and not into light.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Aleph. Only against me he hath turned, and turned again his hand all the day.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Beth. My skin and my flesh he hath made old, he hath broken my bones.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Beth. He hath built round about me, and he hath compassed me with gall and labour.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Beth. He hath set me in dark places as those that are dead for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Ghimel. He hath built against me round about, that I may not get out: he hath made my fetters heavy.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Ghimel. Yea, and when I cry, and entreat, he hath shut out my prayer.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Ghimel. He hath shut up my ways with square stones, he hath turned my paths upside down.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Daleth. He is become to me as a bear lying in wait: as a lion in secret places.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Daleth. He hath turned aside my paths, and hath broken me in pieces, he hath made me desolate.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Daleth. He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for his arrows.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He. He hath shot into my reins the daughters of his quiver.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He. I am made a derision to all my people, their song all the day long.</verse>
  <verse number="15">He. He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath inebriated me with wormwood.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Vau. And he hath broken my teeth one by one, he hath fed me with ashes.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Vau. And my soul is removed far off from peace, I have forgotten good things.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Vau. And I said: My end and my hope is perished from the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Zain. Remember my poverty, and transgression, the wormwood, and the gall.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Zain. I will be mindful and remember, and my soul shall languish within me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Zain. These things I shall think over in my heart, therefore will I hope.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Heth. The mercies of the Lord that we are not consumed: because his commiserations have not failed.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Heth. They are new every morning, great is thy faithfulness.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Heth. The Lord is my portion, said my soul: therefore will I wait for him.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Teth. The Lord is good to them that hope in him, to the soul that seeketh him.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Teth. It is good to wait with silence for the salvation of God.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Teth. It is good for a man, when he hath borne the yoke from his youth.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Jod. He shall sit solitary, and hold his peace: because he hath taken it up upon himself.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Jod. He shall put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Jod. He shall give his cheek to him that striketh him, he shall be filled with reproaches.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Caph. For the Lord will not cast off for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Caph. For if he hath cast off, he will also have mercy, according to the multitude of his mercies.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Caph. For he hath not willingly afflicted, nor cast off the children of men.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Lamed. To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the land,</verse>
  <verse number="35">Lamed. To turn aside the judgment of a man before the face of the most High,</verse>
  <verse number="36">Lamed. To destroy a man wrongfully in his judgment, the Lord hath not approved.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Mem. Who is he that hath commanded a thing to be done, when the Lord commandeth it not?</verse>
  <verse number="38">Mem. Shall not both evil and good proceed out of the mouth of the Highest?</verse>
  <verse number="39">Mem. Why hath a living man murmured, man suffering for his sins?</verse>
  <verse number="40">Nun. Let us search our ways, and seek, and return to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Nun. Let us lift up our hearts with our hands to the Lord in the heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="42">Nun. We have done wickedly, and provoked thee to wrath: therefore thou art inexorable.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Samech. Thou hast covered in thy wrath, and hast struck us: thou hast killed and hast not spared.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Samech. Thou hast set a cloud before thee, that our prayer may not pass through.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Samech. Thou hast made me as an outcast, and refuse in the midst of the people.</verse>
  <verse number="46">Phe. All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.</verse>
  <verse number="47">Phe. Prophecy is become to us a fear, and a snare, and destruction.</verse>
  <verse number="48">Phe. My eye hath run down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</verse>
  <verse number="49">Ain. My eye is afflicted, and hath not been quiet, because there was no rest:</verse>
  <verse number="50">Ain. Till the Lord regarded and looked down from the heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="51">Ain. My eye hath wasted my soul because of all the daughters of my city.</verse>
  <verse number="52">Sade. My enemies have chased me and caught me like a bird, without cause.</verse>
  <verse number="53">Sade. My life is fallen into the pit, and they have laid a stone over me.</verse>
  <verse number="54">Sade. Waters have flowed over my head: I said: I am cut off.</verse>
  <verse number="55">Coph. I have called upon thy name, O Lord, from the lowest pit.</verse>
  <verse number="56">Coph. Thou hast heard my voice: turn not away thy ear from my sighs, and cries.</verse>
  <verse number="57">Coph. Thou drewest near in the day, when I called upon thee, thou saidst: Fear not.</verse>
  <verse number="58">Res. Thou hast judged, O Lord, the cause of my soul, thou the Redeemer of my life.</verse>
  <verse number="59">Res. Thou hast seen, O Lord, their iniquity against me: judge thou my judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="60">Res. Thou hast seen all their fury, and all their thoughts against me.</verse>
  <verse number="61">Sin. Thou hast heard their reproach, O Lord, all their imaginations against me.</verse>
  <verse number="62">Sin. The lips of them that rise up against me: and their devices against me all the day.</verse>
  <verse number="63">Sin. Behold their sitting down, and their rising up, I am their song.</verse>
  <verse number="64">Thau. Thou shalt render them a recompense, O Lord, according to the works of their hands.</verse>
  <verse number="65">Thau. Thou shalt give them a buckler of heart, thy labour.</verse>
  <verse number="66">Thau. Thou shalt persecute them in anger, and shalt destroy them from under the heavens, O Lord.</verse>
