<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Remember, O Lord, what is come upon us: consider and behold our reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Our inheritance is turned to aliens: our houses to strangers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">We are become orphans without a father: our mothers are as widows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">We have drunk our water for money: we have bought our wood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">We were dragged by the necks, we were weary and no rest was given us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">We have given our hand to Egypt, and to the Assyrians, that we might be satisfied with bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Our fathers have sinned, and are not: and we have borne their iniquities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Servants have ruled over us: there was none to redeem us out of their hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">We fetched our bread at the peril of our lives, because of the sword in the desert.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Our skin was burnt as an oven, by reason of the violence of the famine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They oppressed the women in Sion, and the virgins in the cities of Juda.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The princes were hanged up by their hand: they did not respect the persons of the ancient.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They abused the young men indecently: and the children fell under the wood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The ancients have ceased from the gates: the young men from the choir of the singers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The joy of our heart is ceased, our dancing is turned into mourning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The crown is fallen from our head woe to us, because we have sinned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Therefore is our heart sorrowful, therefore are our eyes become dim,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For mount Sion, because it is destroyed, foxes have walked upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But thou, O Lord, shalt remain for ever, thy throne from generation to generation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Why wilt thou forget us for ever? why wilt thou forsake us for a long time?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Convert us, O Lord, to thee, and we shall be converted: renew our days, as from the beginning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But thou hast utterly rejected us, thou art exceedingly angry against us.</p>
