<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Elihu addeth and saith:—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Honour me a little, and I shew thee, That yet for God are words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I lift up my knowledge from afar, And to my Maker I ascribe righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For, truly, my words are not false, The perfect in knowledge is with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Lo, God is mighty, and despiseth not, Mighty in power and heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He reviveth not the wicked, And the judgment of the poor appointeth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He withdraweth not from the righteous His eyes, And from kings on the throne, And causeth them to sit for ever, and they are high,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And if prisoners in fetters They are captured with cords of affliction,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then He declareth to them their work, And their transgressions, Because they have become mighty,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And He uncovereth their ear for instruction, And saith that they turn back from iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If they do hear and serve, They complete their days in good, And their years in pleasantness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And if they do not hearken, By the dart they pass away, And expire without knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the profane in heart set the face, They cry not when He hath bound them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Their soul dieth in youth, And their life among the defiled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He draweth out the afflicted in his affliction, And uncovereth in oppression their ear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And also He moved thee from a strait place, To a broad place—no straitness under it, And the sitting beyond of thy table Hath been full of fatness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the judgment of the wicked thou hast fulfilled, Judgment and justice are upheld—because of fury,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Lest He move thee with a stroke, And the abundance of an atonement turn thee not aside.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Doth He value thy riches? He hath gold, and all the forces of power.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Desire not the night, For the going up of peoples in their stead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Take heed—do not turn unto iniquity, For on this thou hast fixed Rather than on affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Lo, God doth sit on high by His power, Who is like Him—a teacher?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Who hath appointed unto Him his way? And who said, ‘Thou hast done iniquity?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Remember that thou magnify His work That men have beheld.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">All men have looked on it, Man looketh attentively from afar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Lo, God is high, And we know not the number of His years, Yea, there is no searching.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">When He doth diminish droppings of the waters, They refine rain according to its vapour,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Which clouds do drop, They distil on man abundantly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Yea, doth any understand The spreadings out of a cloud? The noises of His tabernacle?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Lo, He hath spread over it His light, And the roots of the sea He hath covered,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For by them He doth judge peoples, He giveth food in abundance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">By two palms He hath covered the light, And layeth a charge over it in meeting,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">He sheweth by it to his friend substance, Anger against perversity.</p>
