<p class="verse" data-verse="1">As to the rest, pray, brethren, for us, that the word of the Lord may run, and be honoured, as also with you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And that we may be delivered from unfit and evil men: for not faith of all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But the Lord is faithful, who supports you, and will watch from the evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And we have had confidence in the Lord for you, that what we announce to you, and ye do and will do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And we proclaim to you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, for you to shrink from every brother walking disorderly, and not according to the doctrine which he received of us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For ye yourselves know that ye ought to imitate us: for we were not disorderly among you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Neither ate we the bread of any as a gift; but in fatigue and toil working night and day also, not to overload any of you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Not that we have not power, but that we give ourselves a type to you to imitate us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For also when we were with you, this we proclaimed to you, that if any will not work, neither should he eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For we hear some walking disorderly among you, working nothing, but occupied unprofitably.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And to such we proclaim and beseech by our Lord Jesus Christ, that, with freedom from care working, they should eat their own bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And ye, brethren, lose not courage doing good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And if any listen not to our word by the epistle, mark him, and mix not together with him, that he may change.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And deem not as an enemy, but remind as a brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the Lord of peace himself give to you peace for all in every manner. The Lord with you all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The greeting of Paul with my hand, which is the sign in every epistle: so I write.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with you all. Amen.</p>
