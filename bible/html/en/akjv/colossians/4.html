<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">With praying also for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer every man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All my state shall Tychicus declare to you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Whom I have sent to you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known to you all things which are done here.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salutes you, and Marcus, sisterâ€™s son to Barnabas, (touching whom you received commandments: if he come to you, receive him;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellow workers to the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For I bear him record, that he has a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Salute the brothers which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And when this letter is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that you likewise read the letter from Laodicea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>
