<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say: ‘Wherein hast Thou loved us?’ Was not Esau Jacob’s brother? Saith the LORD; Yet I loved Jacob;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But Esau I hated, And made his mountains a desolation, And gave his heritage to the jackals of the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Whereas Edom saith: ‘We are beaten down, But we will return and build the waste places’; Thus saith the LORD of hosts: They shall build, but I will throw down; And they shall be called The border of wickedness, And The people whom the LORD execrateth for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And your eyes shall see, And ye shall say: ‘The LORD is great beyond the border of Israel.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">A son honoureth his father, And a servant his master; If then I be a father, Where is My honour? And if I be a master, Where is My fear? Saith the LORD of hosts Unto you, O priests, that despise My name. And ye say: ‘Wherein have we despised Thy name?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Ye offer polluted bread upon Mine altar. And ye say: ‘Wherein have we polluted thee?’ In that ye say: ‘The table of the LORD is contemptible.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And when ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it no evil! And when ye offer the lame and sick, is it no evil! Present it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee? Or will he accept thy person? Saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And now, I pray you, entreat the favour of God That He may be gracious unto us!—This hath been of your doing.—Will He accept any of your persons? Saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Oh that there were even one among you that would shut the doors, That ye might not kindle fire on Mine altar in vain! I have no pleasure in you, Saith the LORD of hosts, Neither will I accept an offering at your hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same My name is great among the nations; And in every place offerings are presented unto My name, Even pure oblations; For My name is great among the nations, Saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But ye profane it, In that ye say: ‘The table of the LORD is polluted, And the fruit thereof, even the food thereof, is contemptible.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Ye say also: ‘Behold, what a weariness is it!’ And ye have snuffed at it, Saith the LORD of hosts; And ye have brought that which was taken by violence, And the lame, and the sick; Thus ye bring the offering; Should I accept this of your hand? Saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But cursed be he that dealeth craftily, Whereas he hath in his flock a male, And voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a blemished thing; For I am a great King, Saith the LORD of hosts, And My name is feared among the nations.</p>
