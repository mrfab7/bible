<chapter book="Job" number="7" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Is there not a warfare to man upon earth? and are not his days like the days of an hireling?</verse>
  <verse number="2">As a servant that earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling that looketh for his wages:</verse>
  <verse number="3">So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise? but the night is long; and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</verse>
  <verse number="5">My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin closeth up and breaketh out afresh.</verse>
  <verse number="6">My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Oh remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The eye of him that seeth me shall behold me no more: thine eyes shall be upon me, but I shall not be.</verse>
  <verse number="9">As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away, so he that goeth down to Sheol shall come up no more.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, that thou settest a watch over me?</verse>
  <verse number="13">When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:</verse>
  <verse number="15">So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than these my bones.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I loathe my life; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="17">What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him, and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him,</verse>
  <verse number="18">And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?</verse>
  <verse number="19">How long wilt thou not look away from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</verse>
  <verse number="20">If I have sinned, what do I unto thee, O thou watcher of men? why hast thou set me as a mark for thee, so that I am a burden to myself?</verse>
  <verse number="21">And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I lie down in the dust; and thou shall seek me diligently, but I shall not be.</verse>
