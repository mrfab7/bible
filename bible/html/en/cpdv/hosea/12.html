<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Ephraim feeds on wind and follows burning heat; all day long he multiplies lies and desolation. And he has entered into a pact with the Assyrians, and he has carried oil into Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Therefore, the judgment of the Lord is with Judah and a visitation is upon Jacob. He will repay him according to his ways and according to his inventions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">In the womb, he supplanted his brother; for in his good fortune, he had been guided by an angel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he prevailed over an angel, for he had been strengthened. He wept and petitioned him. He found him in Bethel, and there he has spoken to us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the Lord God of hosts, the Lord is his memorial.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And so, you should convert to your God. Keep mercy and judgment, and have hope in your God always.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Canaan, in his hand is a deceitful balance, he has chosen false accusations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Ephraim has said, “Nevertheless, I have become rich; I have found an idol for myself. All of my labors will not reveal to me the iniquity that I have committed.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And I, the Lord your God from the land of Egypt, nevertheless will cause you to dwell in tabernacles, just as during the days of the feast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I have spoken through the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and I have used parables through the hands of the prophets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If Gilead is an idol, then they have been sacrificing cattle in Gilgal to no purpose. For even their altars are like clutter on the soil of the field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Jacob fled into the region of Syria, and Israel served like a wife, and was served by a wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Yet by a prophet the Lord led Israel out of Egypt, and he was served by a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Ephraim has provoked me to wrath with his bitterness, and his blood will overcome him, and his Lord will requite him for his shamefulness.</p>
