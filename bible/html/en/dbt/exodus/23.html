<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Thou shalt not accept a false report; extend not thy hand to the wicked, to be an unrighteous witness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thou shalt not follow the multitude for evil; neither shalt thou answer in a cause, to go after the multitude to pervert [judgment].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Neither shalt thou favour a poor man in his cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">—If thou meet thine enemy’s ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt certainly bring it back to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If thou see the ass of him that hateth thee lying under its burden, beware of leaving [it] to him: thou shalt certainly loosen [it] with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of thy poor in his cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thou shalt keep far from the cause of falsehood; and the innocent and righteous slay not; for I will not justify the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And thou shalt take no bribe; for the bribe blindeth those whose eyes are open, and perverteth the words of the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the stranger thou shalt not oppress; for ye know the spirit of the stranger, for ye have been strangers in the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And six years thou shalt sow thy land, and gather in its produce;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">but in the seventh thou shalt let it rest and lie [fallow], that the poor of thy people may eat [of it]; and what they leave, the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard, and with thine olive-tree.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">—Six days thou shalt do thy work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest; that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid, and the stranger may be refreshed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And ye shall be on your guard as to everything that I have said unto you; and shall make no mention of the name of other gods—it shall not be heard in thy mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thrice in the year thou shalt celebrate a feast to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread, (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I have commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt; and none shall appear in my presence empty;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">and the feast of harvest, the first-fruits of thy labours which thou hast sown in the field, and the feast of in-gathering, at the end of the year, when thou gatherest in thy labours out of the field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Three times in the year all thy males shall appear in the presence of the Lord Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night until the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The first of the first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Behold, I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way, and to bring thee to the place that I have prepared.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Be careful in his presence, and hearken unto his voice: do not provoke him, for he will not forgive your transgressions; for my name is in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But if thou shalt diligently hearken unto his voice, and do all that I shall say, then I will be an enemy to thine enemies, and an adversary to thine adversaries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For mine Angel shall go before thee, and bring thee in unto the Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Canaanites, the Hivites and the Jebusites; and I will cut them off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their deeds; but thou shalt utterly destroy them, and utterly shatter their statues.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And ye shall serve Jehovah your God; and he shall bless thy bread and thy water; and I will take sickness away from thy midst.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">There shall nothing cast their young, nor be barren, in thy land; the number of thy days will I fulfil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">I will send my fear before thee, and confound every people to which thou comest, and will make all thine enemies turn their back to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">I will not drive them out from before thee in one year: lest the land become desolate, and the beast of the field multiply against thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">By little and little I will drive them out from before thee, until thou art fruitful, and possess the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And I will set thy bounds from the Red Sea even unto the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness unto the river; for I will give the inhabitants of the land into your hand, that thou mayest dispossess them from before thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me; for if thou serve their gods, it is sure to be a snare unto thee.</p>
