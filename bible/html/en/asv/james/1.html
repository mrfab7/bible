<p class="verse" data-verse="1">James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are of the Dispersion, greeting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Count it all joy, my brethren, when ye fall into manifold temptations;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">knowing that the proving of your faith worketh patience.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And let patience have its perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, lacking in nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But if any of you lacketh wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But let him ask in faith, nothing doubting: for he that doubteth is like the surge of the sea driven by the wind and tossed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">a doubleminded man, unstable in all his ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But let the brother of low degree glory in his high estate:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the sun ariseth with the scorching wind, and withereth the grass; and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his goings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been approved, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to them that love him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempteth no man:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">but each man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own lust, and enticed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Then the lust, when it hath conceived, beareth sin: and the sin, when it is fullgrown, bringeth forth death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Be not deceived, my beloved brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom can be no variation, neither shadow that is cast by turning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Ye know this, my beloved brethren. But let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Wherefore putting away all filthiness and overflowing of wickedness, receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deluding your own selves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For if any one is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a mirror:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">for he beholdeth himself, and goeth away, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But he that looketh into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and so continueth, being not a hearer that forgetteth but a doer that worketh, this man shall be blessed in his doing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">If any man thinketh himself to be religious, while he bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his heart, this manâ€™s religion is vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.</p>
