<chapter book="Titus" number="1" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Paul, a servant of God and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, in accord with the faith of God’s elect and in acknowledgment of the truth which is accompanied by piety,</verse>
  <verse number="2">in the hope of the eternal life that God, who does not lie, promised before the ages of time,</verse>
  <verse number="3">which, at the proper time, he has manifested by his Word, in the preaching that has been entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior;</verse>
  <verse number="4">to Titus, beloved son according to the common faith. Grace and peace, from God the Father and from Christ Jesus our Savior.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For this reason, I left you behind in Crete: so that those things which are lacking, you would correct, and so that you would ordain, throughout the communities, priests, (just as I also ordained you)</verse>
  <verse number="6">if such a man is without offense, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of self-indulgence, nor of insubordination.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And a bishop, as a steward of God, must be without offense: not arrogant, not short-tempered, not a drunkard, not violent, not desiring tainted profit,</verse>
  <verse number="8">but instead: hospitable, kind, sober, just, holy, chaste,</verse>
  <verse number="9">embracing faithful speech which is in agreement with doctrine, so that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine and to argue against those who contradict.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For there are, indeed, many who are disobedient, who speak empty words, and who deceive, especially those who are of the circumcision.</verse>
  <verse number="11">These must be reproved, for they subvert entire houses, teaching things which should not be taught, for the favor of shameful gain.</verse>
  <verse number="12">A certain one of these, a prophet of their own kind, said: “The Cretans are ever liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">This testimony is true. Because of this, rebuke them sharply, so that they may be sound in the faith,</verse>
  <verse number="14">not paying attention to Jewish fables, nor to the rules of men who have turned themselves away from the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">All things are clean to those who are clean. But to those who are defiled, and to unbelievers, nothing is clean; for both their mind and their conscience have been polluted.</verse>
  <verse number="16">They claim that they know God. But, by their own works, they deny him, since they are abominable, and unbelieving, and reprobate, toward every good work.</verse>
