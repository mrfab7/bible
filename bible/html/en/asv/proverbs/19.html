<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="19" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity Than he that is perverse in his lips and is a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Also, that the soul be without knowledge is not good; And he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The foolishness of man subverteth his way; And his heart fretteth against Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Wealth addeth many friends; But the poor is separated from his friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A false witness shall not be unpunished; And he that uttereth lies shall not escape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Many will entreat the favor of the liberal man; And every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All the brethren of the poor do hate him: How much more do his friends go far from him! He pursueth them with words, but they are gone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: He that keepeth understanding shall find good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A false witness shall not be unpunished; And he that uttereth lies shall perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Delicate living is not seemly for a fool; Much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The discretion of a man maketh him slow to anger; And it is his glory to pass over a transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion; But his favor is as dew upon the grass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A foolish son is the calamity of his father; And the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">House and riches are an inheritance from fathers; But a prudent wife is from Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; And the idle soul shall suffer hunger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his soul; But he that is careless of his ways shall die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto Jehovah, And his good deed will he pay him again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Chasten thy son, seeing there is hope; And set not thy heart on his destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A man of great wrath shall bear the penalty; For if thou deliver him, thou must do it yet again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Hear counsel, and receive instruction, That thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">There are many devices in a man’s heart; But the counsel of Jehovah, that shall stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">That which maketh a man to be desired is his kindness; And a poor man is better than a liar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The fear of Jehovah tendeth to life; And he that hath it shall abide satisfied; He shall not be visited with evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish, And will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Smite a scoffer, and the simple will learn prudence; And reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He that doeth violence to his father, and chaseth away his mother, Is a son that causeth shame and bringeth reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Cease, my son, to hear instruction Only to err from the words of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A worthless witness mocketh at justice; And the mouth of the wicked swalloweth iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Judgments are prepared for scoffers, And stripes for the back of fools.</p>
