<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And thou shalt lay them in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And it shall come to pass, that the man’s rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, by which they murmur against you.</p>
