<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Are there not mockers with me? and does not my eye continue in their provocation?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Lay down now, put me in a surety with you; who is he that will strike hands with me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For you have hid their heart from understanding: therefore shall you not exalt them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He that speaks flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He has made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Upright men shall be astonished at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that has clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But as for you all, do you return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I wait, the grave is my house: I have made my bed in the darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I have said to corruption, You are my father: to the worm, You are my mother, and my sister.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.</p>
