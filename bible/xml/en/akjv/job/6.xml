<chapter book="Job" number="6" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But Job answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Oh that my grief were thoroughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!</verse>
  <verse number="3">For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinks up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Does the wild ass bray when he has grass? or lows the ox over his fodder?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Can that which is unsavory be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</verse>
  <verse number="7">The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</verse>
  <verse number="9">Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then should I yet have comfort; yes, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</verse>
  <verse number="11">What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is my end, that I should prolong my life?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?</verse>
  <verse number="14">To him that is afflicted pity should be showed from his friend; but he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
  <verse number="15">My brothers have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;</verse>
  <verse number="16">Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:</verse>
  <verse number="17">What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For now you are nothing; you see my casting down, and are afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Did I say, Bring to me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Or, Deliver me from the enemy’s hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</verse>
  <verse number="25">How forcible are right words! but what does your arguing reprove?</verse>
  <verse number="26">Do you imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?</verse>
  <verse number="27">Yes, you overwhelm the fatherless, and you dig a pit for your friend.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Now therefore be content, look on me; for it is evident to you if I lie.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yes, return again, my righteousness is in it.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?</verse>
