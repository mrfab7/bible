<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Listen diligently to my speech. Let this be your consolation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Allow me, and I also will speak; After I have spoken, mock on.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">As for me, is my complaint to man? Why shouldn’t I be impatient?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Look at me, and be astonished. Lay your hand on your mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When I remember, I am troubled. Horror takes hold of my flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">“Why do the wicked live, become old, yes, and grow mighty in power?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Their child is established with them in their sight, their offspring before their eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Their bulls breed without fail. Their cows calve, and don’t miscarry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They send forth their little ones like a flock. Their children dance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They sing to the tambourine and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the pipe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They spend their days in prosperity. In an instant they go down to Sheol.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">They tell God, ‘Depart from us, for we don’t want to know about your ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? What profit should we have, if we pray to him?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Behold, their prosperity is not in their hand. The counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">“How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out, that their calamity comes on them, that God distributes sorrows in his anger?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">How often is it that they are as stubble before the wind, as chaff that the storm carries away?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">You say, ‘God lays up his iniquity for his children.’ Let him recompense it to himself, that he may know it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Let his own eyes see his destruction. Let him drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For what does he care for his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">“Shall any teach God knowledge, since he judges those who are high?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">One dies in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">His pails are full of milk. The marrow of his bones is moistened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Another dies in bitterness of soul, and never tastes of good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">They lie down alike in the dust. The worm covers them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">“Behold, I know your thoughts, the devices with which you would wrong me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For you say, ‘Where is the house of the prince? Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Haven’t you asked wayfaring men? Don’t you know their evidences,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">that the evil man is reserved to the day of calamity, That they are led forth to the day of wrath?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Who shall declare his way to his face? Who shall repay him what he has done?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Yet he will be borne to the grave. Men shall keep watch over the tomb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The clods of the valley shall be sweet to him. All men shall draw after him, as there were innumerable before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">So how can you comfort me with nonsense, because in your answers there remains only falsehood?”</p>
