  <verse number="1">When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John</verse>
  <verse number="2">(although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples),</verse>
  <verse number="3">he left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he must needs pass through Samaria.</verse>
  <verse number="5">So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph:</verse>
  <verse number="6">and Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
  <verse number="7">There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)</verse>
  <verse number="10">Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that living water?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</verse>
  <verse number="14">but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband:</verse>
  <verse number="18">for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers.</verse>
  <verse number="24">God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And upon this came his disciples; and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?</verse>
  <verse number="28">So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the people,</verse>
  <verse number="29">Come, see a man, who told me all things that ever I did: can this be the Christ?</verse>
  <verse number="30">They went out of the city, and were coming to him.</verse>
  <verse number="31">In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not.</verse>
  <verse number="33">The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him aught to eat?</verse>
  <verse number="34">Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest.</verse>
  <verse number="36">He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; that he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For herein is the saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</verse>
  <verse number="38">I sent you to reap that whereon ye have not labored: others have labored, and ye are entered into their labor.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that ever I did.</verse>
  <verse number="40">So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And many more believed because of his word;</verse>
  <verse number="42">and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="44">For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.</verse>
  <verse number="45">So when he came into Galilee, the Galilæans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</verse>
  <verse number="46">He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</verse>
  <verse number="47">When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judæa into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.</verse>
  <verse number="48">Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe.</verse>
  <verse number="49">The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</verse>
  <verse number="50">Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way.</verse>
  <verse number="51">And as he was now going down, his servants met him, saying, that his son lived.</verse>
  <verse number="52">So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</verse>
  <verse number="53">So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</verse>
  <verse number="54">This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judæa into Galilee.</verse>
