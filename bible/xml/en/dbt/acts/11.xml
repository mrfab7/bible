  <verse number="1">And the apostles and the brethren who were in Judaea heard that the nations also had received the word of God;</verse>
  <verse number="2">and when Peter went up to Jerusalem, they of the circumcision contended with him,</verse>
  <verse number="3">saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised and hast eaten with them.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But Peter began and set forth [the matter] to them in order, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="5">I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in an ecstasy I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending like a great sheet, let down by four corners out of heaven, and it came even to me:</verse>
  <verse number="6">on which having fixed mine eyes, I considered, and saw the quadrupeds of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the fowls of the heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And I heard also a voice saying to me, Rise up, Peter, slay and eat.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And I said, In no wise, Lord, for common or unclean has never entered into my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And a voice answered the second time out of heaven, What God has cleansed, do not thou make common.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And this took place thrice, and again all was drawn up into heaven;</verse>
  <verse number="11">and lo, immediately three men were at the house in which I was, sent to me from Caesarea.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the Spirit said to me to go with them, nothing doubting. And there went with me these six brethren also, and we entered into the house of the man,</verse>
  <verse number="13">and he related to us how he had seen the angel in his house, standing and saying [to him], Send [men] to Joppa and fetch Simon, who is surnamed Peter,</verse>
  <verse number="14">who shall speak words to thee whereby thou shalt be saved, thou and all thy house.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them even as upon us also at the beginning.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John baptised with water, but ye shall be baptised with [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="17">If then God has given them the same gift as also to us when we had believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who indeed was I to be able to forbid God?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And when they heard these things they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then indeed God has to the nations also granted repentance to life.</verse>
  <verse number="19">They then who had been scattered abroad through the tribulation that took place on the occasion of Stephen, passed through [the country] to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one but to Jews alone.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But there were certain of them, Cyprians and Cyrenians, who entering into Antioch spoke to the Greeks also, announcing the glad tidings of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And [the] Lord’s hand was with them, and a great number believed and turned to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the report concerning them reached the ears of the assembly which was in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to go through as far as Antioch:</verse>
  <verse number="23">who, having arrived and seeing the grace of God, rejoiced, and exhorted all with purpose of heart to abide with the Lord;</verse>
  <verse number="24">for he was a good man and full of [the] Holy Spirit and of faith; and a large crowd [of people] were added to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he went away to Tarsus to seek out Saul.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And having found [him], he brought him to Antioch. And so it was with them that for a whole year they were gathered together in the assembly and taught a large crowd: and the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Now in these days prophets went down from Jerusalem to Antioch;</verse>
  <verse number="28">and one from among them, by name Agabus, rose up and signified by the Spirit that there was going to be a great famine over all the inhabited earth, which also came to pass under Claudius.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And they determined, according as any one of the disciples was well off, each of them to send to the brethren who dwelt in Judaea, to minister [to them];</verse>
  <verse number="30">which also they did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</verse>
