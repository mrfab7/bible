  <verse number="1">And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, your father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, your son Joseph comes to you: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Jacob said to Joseph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,</verse>
  <verse number="4">And said to me, Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a multitude of people; and will give this land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And now your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And your issue, which you beget after them, shall be yours, and shall be called after the name of their brothers in their inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come to Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, Who are these?</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray you, to me, and I will bless them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near to him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see your face: and, see, God has showed me also your seed.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand, and brought them near to him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long to this day,</verse>
  <verse number="16">The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the middle of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put your right hand on his head.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he blessed them that day, saying, In you shall Israel bless, saying, God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.</verse>
