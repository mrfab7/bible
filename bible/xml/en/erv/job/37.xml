  <verse number="1">At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of its place.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hearken ye unto the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">After it a voice roareth; he thundereth with the voice of his majesty: and he stayeth them not when his voice is heard.</verse>
  <verse number="5">God thundereth marvelously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For he saith to the snow, Fall thou on the earth; likewise to the shower of rain, and to the showers of his mighty rain.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men whom he hath made may know it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then the beasts go into coverts, and remain in their dens.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Out of the chamber of the south cometh the storm: and cold out of the north.</verse>
  <verse number="10">By the breath of God ice is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture; he spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning:</verse>
  <verse number="12">And it is turned round about by his guidance, that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the habitable world.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Whether it be for correction, or for his land, or for mercy, that he cause it to come.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Dost thou know how God layeth his charge upon them, and causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine?</verse>
  <verse number="16">Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?</verse>
  <verse number="17">How thy garments are warm, when the earth is still by reason of the south wind?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Canst thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong as a molten mirror?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Shall it be told him that I would speak? or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?</verse>
  <verse number="21">And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Out of the north cometh golden splendour: God hath upon him terrible majesty.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Touching the Almighty, we can not find him out; he is excellent in power: and in judgment and plenteous justice he will not afflict.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Men do therefore fear him: he regardeth not any that are wise of heart.</verse>
