<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="3" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, as unto babes in Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I fed you with milk, not with meat; for ye were not yet able to bear it: nay, not even now are ye able;</verse>
  <verse number="3">for ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you jealousy and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk after the manner of men?</verse>
  <verse number="4">For when one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not men?</verse>
  <verse number="5">What then is Apollos? and what is Paul? Ministers through whom ye believed; and each as the Lord gave to him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</verse>
  <verse number="7">So then neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For we are God’s fellow-workers: ye are God’s husbandry, God’s building.</verse>
  <verse number="10">According to the grace of God which was given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder I laid a foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let each man take heed how he buildeth thereon.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But if any man buildeth on the foundation gold, silver, costly stones, wood, hay, stubble;</verse>
  <verse number="13">each man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it is revealed in fire; and the fire itself shall prove each man’s work of what sort it is.</verse>
  <verse number="14">If any man’s work shall abide which he built thereon, he shall receive a reward.</verse>
  <verse number="15">If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through fire.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Know ye not that ye are a temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</verse>
  <verse number="17">If any man destroyeth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Let no man deceive himself. If any man thinketh that he is wise among you in this world, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He that taketh the wise in their craftiness:</verse>
  <verse number="20">and again, The Lord knoweth the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Wherefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;</verse>
  <verse number="22">whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</verse>
  <verse number="23">and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.</verse>
