  <verse number="1">But speak thou the things which befit the sound doctrine:</verse>
  <verse number="2">that aged men be temperate, grave, sober-minded, sound in faith, in love, in patience:</verse>
  <verse number="3">that aged women likewise be reverent in demeanor, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;</verse>
  <verse number="4">that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,</verse>
  <verse number="5">to be sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed:</verse>
  <verse number="6">the younger men likewise exhort to be sober-minded:</verse>
  <verse number="7">in all things showing thyself an ensample of good works; in thy doctrine showing uncorruptness, gravity,</verse>
  <verse number="8">sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of us.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing to them in all things; not gainsaying;</verse>
  <verse number="10">not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the grace of God hath appeared, bringing salvation to all men,</verse>
  <verse number="12">instructing us, to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly and righteously and godly in this present world;</verse>
  <verse number="13">looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="14">who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a people for his own possession, zealous of good works.</verse>
  <verse number="15">These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</verse>
