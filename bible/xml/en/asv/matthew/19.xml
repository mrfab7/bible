  <verse number="1">And it came to pass when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of Judæa beyond the Jordan;</verse>
  <verse number="2">and great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And there came unto him Pharisees, trying him, and saying, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he answered and said, Have ye not read, that he who made them from the beginning made them male and female,</verse>
  <verse number="5">and said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and the two shall become one flesh?</verse>
  <verse number="6">So that they are no more two, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They say unto him, Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorcement, and to put her away?</verse>
  <verse number="8">He saith unto them, Moses for your hardness of heart suffered you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it hath not been so.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery : and he that marrieth her when she is put away committeth adultery.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The disciples say unto him, If the case of the man is so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But he said unto them, Not all men can receive this saying, but they to whom it is given.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For there are eunuchs, that were so born from their mother’s womb: and there are eunuchs, that were made eunuchs by men: and there are eunuchs, that made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should lay his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But Jesus said, Suffer the little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for to such belongeth the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And behold, one came to him and said, Teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he said unto him, Why askest thou me concerning that which is good? One there is who is good: but if thou wouldest enter into life, keep the commandments.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He saith unto him, Which? And Jesus said, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,</verse>
  <verse number="19">Honor thy father and thy mother; and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The young man saith unto him, All these things have I observed: what lack I yet?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Jesus said unto him, If thou wouldest be perfect, go, sell that which thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But when the young man heard the saying, he went away sorrowful; for he was one that had great possessions.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Jesus said unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, It is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through a needle’s eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And when the disciples heard it, they were astonished exceedingly, saying, Who then can be saved?</verse>
  <verse number="26">And Jesus looking upon them said to them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Then answered Peter and said unto him, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee; what then shall we have?</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, that ye who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And every one that hath left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for my name’s sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life.</verse>
  <verse number="30">But many shall be last that are first; and first that are last.</verse>
