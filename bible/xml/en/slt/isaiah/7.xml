<chapter book="Isaiah" number="7" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And it will be in the days of Ahaz son of Jotham son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin, king of Aram came up, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, to Jerusalem, to war against her, and he was not able to fight against her.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And it will be announced to the house of David, saying, Aram rested upon Ephraim; and his heart will move to and fro and the heart of his people, as the woods of the forest moved from the face of the wind.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Jehovah will say to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou and Shear-Jashub thy son, at the extremity of the channel of the highest pool of the highway, of the fuller’s field;</verse>
  <verse number="4">And say to him, Watch and rest; thou shalt not fear, and thy heart shall not be tender from the two tails of these smoking fire-brands, upon the heat of anger of Rezin and Aram, and the son of Remaliah.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Because Aram, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, will counsel evil against thee, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="6">We will go up against Judah and terrify her and subdue her for us, and we will make a king in the midst of her, the son of Tabeal:</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thus said the Lord Jehovah, It shall not stand, and it shall not be.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For the head of Aram, Damascus, and the head of Damascus, Rezin, and in yet sixty and five years Ephraim shall be broken from a people.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the head of Ephraim, Shomeron, and the head of Shomeron, the son of Remaliah. If ye will not believe, because ye will not believe.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Jehovah will add to speak to Ahaz, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="11">Ask for thee a sign from Jehovah thy God; make deep the asking, or make high upwards.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Ahaz will say, I will not ask and I will not tempt Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he will say, Hear ye now, house of David; is it small for you to weary men, but will ye weary God also.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For this, Jehovah he will give to you a sign Behold, the virgin conceiving, and she will bare a son, and call his name Immanuel.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Curdled milk and honey he shall eat, for his knowing to reject in evil, and to choose in good.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For before the boy shall know to reject in evil and to choose in good the land which thou abhorrest shall be forsaken from the face of its two kings.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Jehovah shall bring upon thee and upon thy people, and upon thy father’s house, days which came not, from the day Ephraim turned away from Judah; the king of Assur.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And it was in that day Jehovah shall hiss for the fly which is in the extremity of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee which is in the land of Assur.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And they shall come and rest all of them in the valleys, and in the clefts of the rocks, and in all the thorn hedges, and in all pastures.</verse>
  <verse number="20">In that day shall Jehovah shave with a hired razor by those beyond the river, by the king of Assur, the head and the hair of the feet: and it also shall scrape off the beard.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And it was in, that day a man shall preserve alive a heifer of the herd, and two sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And it was from the abundance of making milk he shall eat curdled milk; for curdled milk and honey shall eat all they being left in the midst of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And it was in that day every place shall be where shall be there a thousand vines for a thousand of silver, for sharp points and thorns shall it be.</verse>
  <verse number="24">With arrows and with bows shall he come there: for sharp points and thorns shall be all the land.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And all the mountains which shall be dressed with the hoe, the fear of sharp points and thorns shall not come there: and it was for the sending forth of the ox and for the treading of sheep.</verse>
