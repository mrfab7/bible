<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="32" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and you are very old; why I was afraid, and dared not show you my opinion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty gives them understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore I said, Listen to me; I also will show my opinion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst you searched out what to say.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Yes, I attended to you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Lest you should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusts him down, not man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Now he has not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">When I had waited, (for they spoke not, but stood still, and answered no more;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I said, I will answer also my part, I also will show my opinion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constrains me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Behold, my belly is as wine which has no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Let me not, I pray you, accept any manâ€™s person, neither let me give flattering titles to man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.</p>
