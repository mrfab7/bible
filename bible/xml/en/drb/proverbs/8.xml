<chapter book="Proverbs" number="8" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Doth not wisdom cry aloud, and prudence put forth her voice ?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Standing in the top of the highest places by the way, in the midst of the paths.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Beside the gates of the city, in the very doors she speaketh, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="4">O ye men, to you I call, and my voice is to the sons of men.</verse>
  <verse number="5">O little ones, understand subtilty, and ye unwise, take notice.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Hear, for I will speak of great things: and my lips shall be opened to preach right things.</verse>
  <verse number="7">My mouth shall meditate truth, and my lips shall hate wickedness.</verse>
  <verse number="8">All my words are just, there is nothing wicked nor perverse in them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">They are right to them that understand, and just to them that find knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Receive my instruction, and not money: choose knowledge rather than gold.</verse>
  <verse number="11">11For wisdom is better than all the most precious things: and whatsoever may be desired cannot be compared to</verse>
  <verse number="12">I wisdom dwell in counsel, and am present in learned thoughts.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The fear of the Lord hateth evil: I hate arrogance, and pride, and every wicked way, and a mouth with a double tongue.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Counsel and equity is mine, prudence is mine, strength is mine.</verse>
  <verse number="15">By me kings reign, and lawgivers decree just things,</verse>
  <verse number="16">By me princes rule, and the mighty decree justice.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I love them that love me: and they that in the morning early watch for me, shall find me.</verse>
  <verse number="18">With me are riches and glory, glorious riches and justice.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For my fruit is better than gold and the precious stone, and my blossoms than choice silver.</verse>
  <verse number="20">I walk in the way of justice, in the midst of the paths of judgment,</verse>
  <verse number="21">That I may enrich them that love me, and may fill their treasures.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his ways, before he made any thing from the beginning.</verse>
  <verse number="23">I was set up from eternity, and of old before the earth was made.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The depths were not as yet, and I was already conceived. neither had the fountains of waters as yet sprung out:</verse>
  <verse number="25">The mountains with their huge bulk had not as yet been established: before the hills I was brought forth:</verse>
  <verse number="26">He had not yet made the earth, nor the rivers, nor the poles of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="27">When he prepared the heavens, I was present: when with a certain law and compass he enclosed the depths:</verse>
  <verse number="28">When he established the sky above, and poised the fountains of waters:</verse>
  <verse number="29">When he compassed the sea with its bounds, and set a law to the waters that they should not pass their limits: when be balanced the foundations of the earth;</verse>
  <verse number="30">I was with him forming all things: and was delighted every day, playing before him at all times;</verse>
  <verse number="31">Playing in the world: and my delights were to be with the children of men.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Now therefore, ye children, hear me: Blessed are they that keep my ways.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Hear instruction and be wise, and refuse it not.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Blessed is the man that heareth me, and that watcheth daily at my gates, and waiteth at the posts of my doors.</verse>
  <verse number="35">He that shall find me, shall find life, and shall have salvation from the Lord:</verse>
  <verse number="36">But he that shall sin against me, shall hurt his own soul. All that hate me love death.</verse>
