  <verse number="1">How beautiful art thou, my love, how beautiful art thou! thy eyes are doves’ eyes, besides what is hid within. Thy hair is as flocks of goats, which Come up from mount Galaad.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thy teeth as flocks of sheep, that are shorn which come up from the washing, all with twins, and there is none barren among them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thy lips are as a scarlet lace: and thy speech sweet. Thy cheeks are as a piece of a pomegranate, besides that which lieth hid within.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thy neck, is as the tower of David, which is built with bulwarks: a thousand bucklers hang upon it, all the armour of valiant men.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thy two breasts like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Till the day break, and the shadows retire, I will go to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thou art all fair, O my love, and there is not a spot in thee.</verse>

  <verse number="12">My sister, my spouse, is a garden enclosed, a garden enclosed, a fountain sealed up.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Thy plants are a paradise of pomegranates with the fruits of the orchard. Cypress with spikenard.</verse>

  <verse number="16">Arise, O north wind, and come, O south wind, blow through my garden, and let the aromatical spices thereof flow.</verse>
