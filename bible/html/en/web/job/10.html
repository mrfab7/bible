<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“My soul is weary of my life. I will give free course to my complaint. I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I will tell God, ‘Do not condemn me. Show me why you contend with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is it good to you that you should oppress, that you should despise the work of your hands, and smile on the counsel of the wicked?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Do you have eyes of flesh? Or do you see as man sees?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Are your days as the days of mortals, or your years as man’s years,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">that you inquire after my iniquity, and search after my sin?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Although you know that I am not wicked, there is no one who can deliver out of your hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">“‘Your hands have framed me and fashioned me altogether, yet you destroy me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Remember, I beg you, that you have fashioned me as clay. Will you bring me into dust again?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Haven’t you poured me out like milk, and curdled me like cheese?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">You have clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">You have granted me life and loving kindness. Your visitation has preserved my spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Yet you hid these things in your heart. I know that this is with you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">if I sin, then you mark me. You will not acquit me from my iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If I am wicked, woe to me. If I am righteous, I still shall not lift up my head, being filled with disgrace, and conscious of my affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If my head is held high, you hunt me like a lion. Again you show yourself powerful to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">You renew your witnesses against me, and increase your indignation on me. Changes and warfare are with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">“‘Why, then, have you brought me forth out of the womb? I wish I had given up the spirit, and no eye had seen me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I should have been as though I had not been. I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Aren’t my days few? Cease then. Leave me alone, that I may find a little comfort,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">before I go where I shall not return from, to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">the land dark as midnight, of the shadow of death, without any order, where the light is as midnight.’”</p>
