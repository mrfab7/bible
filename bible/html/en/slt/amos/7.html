<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Thus the Lord Jehovah caused me to see; and behold, he will form locusts in the beginning of the coming up of the latter grass; and behold, the latter grass after the moorings of the king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it was if he finished to devour the green herb of the land, and saying, O Lord Jehovah, forgive now: who shall raise up Jacob? for he is small.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Jehovah lamented for this: It shall not be, said Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thus the Lord Jehovah caused me to see: and behold, the Lord Jehovah called to contend with fire, and it will devour the great deep, and devoured the portion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And saying, O Lord Jehovah, cease now: who shall cause Jacob to rise? for he is small.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thus he caused me to see: and behold, Jehovah stood upon a wall of lead, and lead in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Jehovah will say to me, What seest thou, Amos? And saying, Lead. And Jehovah will say to me: Behold me setting lead in the midst of my people Israel: I will no more add to pass by to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the heights of Isaak were made desolate, and the holy places of Israel shall be laid waste; and I rose up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Amaziah priest of the house of God, will send to Jeroboam, kind of Israel, saying, Amos conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land will not be able to endure all his words.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And now hear the word of Jehovah: Thou sayest thou shalt not prophesy against Israel, and thou shalt not drop against the house of Isaak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For this, thus said Jehovah: Thy wife shall commit fornication in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line, and thou shalt die upon a polluted land: and Israel being taken captive shall be carried into captivity from his land.</p>
