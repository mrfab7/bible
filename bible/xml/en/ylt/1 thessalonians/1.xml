<chapter book="1 Thessalonians" number="1" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the assembly of Thessalonians in God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ!</verse>
  <verse number="2">We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers,</verse>
  <verse number="3">unceasingly remembering of you the work of the faith, and the labour of the love, and the endurance of the hope, of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the presence of our God and Father,</verse>
  <verse number="4">having known, brethren beloved, by God, your election,</verse>
  <verse number="5">because our good news did not come to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance, even as ye have known of what sort we became among you because of you,</verse>
  <verse number="6">and ye—ye did become imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much tribulation, with joy of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
  <verse number="7">so that ye became patterns to all those believing in Macedonia and Achaia,</verse>
  <verse number="8">for from you hath sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith toward God did go forth, so that we have no need to say anything,</verse>
  <verse number="9">for they themselves concerning us do declare what entrance we had unto you, and how ye did turn unto God from the idols, to serve a living and true God,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and to wait for His Son from the heavens, whom He did raise out of the dead—Jesus, who is rescuing us from the anger that is coming.</verse>
