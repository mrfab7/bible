<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And thou shalt make an altar for the burning of incense: of acacia-wood shalt thou make it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">a cubit the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof—square shall it be; and two cubits its height; of itself shall be its horns.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and the horns thereof; and thou shalt make upon it a border of gold round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And two rings of gold shalt thou make for it under its border; by its two corners shalt thou make [them], on the two sides thereof; and they shall be for receptacles for the staves, with which to carry it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And thou shalt make the staves of acacia-wood, and overlay them with gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And thou shalt put it in front of the veil which is before the ark of the testimony in front of the mercy-seat which is over the testimony, where I will meet with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And Aaron shall burn thereon fragrant incense: every morning, when he dresseth the lamps, he shall burn the incense.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And when Aaron lighteth the lamps between the two evenings, he shall burn the incense—a continual incense before Jehovah throughout your generations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Ye shall offer up no strange incense thereon, nor burnt-offering, nor oblation; neither shall ye pour drink-offering thereon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Aaron shall make atonement for its horns once in the year: with the blood of the sin-offering of atonement shall he make atonement for it, once in the year, throughout your generations: it is most holy to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When thou shalt take the sum of the children of Israel according to those of them that are numbered, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul to Jehovah on their being numbered, that there be no plague among them on their being numbered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">This shall they give—every one that passeth among them that are numbered—half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary,—twenty gerahs the shekel; a half shekel shall be the heave-offering for Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Every one that passeth among those that are numbered, from twenty years old and above, shall give the heave-offering of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when ye give the heave-offering of Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And thou shalt take the atonement-money of the children of Israel, and devote it to the service of the tent of meeting; and it shall be a memorial to the children of Israel before Jehovah, to make atonement for your souls.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Thou shalt also make a laver of copper, and its stand of copper, for washing; and thou shalt put it between the tent of meeting and the altar, and shalt put water in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet out of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">When they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, that they may not die; or when they come near to the altar to serve, to burn an offering by fire to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they may not die; and it shall be an everlasting statute for them, for him and for his seed throughout their generations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And thou, take best spices—of liquid myrrh five hundred [shekels], and of sweet cinnamon the half—two hundred and fifty, and of sweet myrtle two hundred and fifty,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary, and of olive oil a hin;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">and make of it an oil of holy ointment, a perfume of perfumery after the work of the perfumer: it shall be the holy anointing oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And thou shalt anoint the tent of meeting with it, and the ark of the testimony,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">and the table and all its utensils, and the lamp-stand and its utensils, and the altar of incense,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">and the altar of burnt-offering and all its utensils, and the laver and its stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And thou shalt hallow them, that they may be most holy: whatever toucheth them shall be holy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And Aaron and his sons thou shalt anoint, and shalt hallow them, that they may serve me as priests.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And thou shalt speak to the children of Israel, saying, A holy anointing oil shall this be unto me throughout your generations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Upon man’s flesh shall it not be poured, neither shall ye make [any] like it, after the preparation of it: it is holy—holy shall it be unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Whoever compoundeth [any] like it, or whoever putteth [any] of it upon any strange thing, shall be cut off from his peoples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And Jehovah said to Moses, Take fragrant drugs—stacte, and onycha, and galbanum—fragrant drugs and pure frankincense; in like proportions shall it be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And thou shalt make it into incense, a perfume, after the work of the perfumer, salted, pure, holy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And thou shalt beat [some] of it to powder, and put [some] of it before the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with thee: it shall be unto you most holy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And the incense that thou shalt make, ye shall not make for yourselves according to the proportions of it; it shall be unto thee holy to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">Whoever maketh like unto it, to smell it, shall be cut off from his peoples.</p>
