  <verse number="2">Pass ye over to Chalane, and see, and go from thence into Emath the great: and go down into Geth of the Philistines, and to all the best kingdoms of these: if their border be larger than your border.</verse>
  <verse number="3">You that are separated unto the evil day: and that approach to the throne of iniquity;</verse>
  <verse number="4">You that sleep upon beds of ivory, and are wanton on your couches: that eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the herd;</verse>
  <verse number="5">You that sing to the sound of the psaltery: they have thought themselves to have instruments of music like David;</verse>
  <verse number="6">That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the best ointments: and they are not concerned for the affliction of Joseph.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Wherefore now they shall go captive at the head of them that go into captivity: and the faction of the luxurious ones shall be taken away.</verse>

  <verse number="11">For behold the Lord hath commanded, and he will strike the greater house with breaches, and the lesser house with clefts.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Can horses run upon the rocks, or can any one plough with buffles? for you have turned judgment into bitterness, and the fruit of justice into wormwood.</verse>
