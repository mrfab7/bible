<chapter book="Colossians" number="3" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">If then you were raised together with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated on the right hand of God.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Set your mind on the things that are above, not on the things that are on the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">When Christ, our life, is revealed, then you will also be revealed with him in glory.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Put to death therefore your members which are on the earth: sexual immorality, uncleanness, depraved passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry;</verse>
  <verse number="6">for which things’ sake the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience.</verse>
  <verse number="7">You also once walked in those, when you lived in them;</verse>
  <verse number="8">but now you also put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and shameful speaking out of your mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Don’t lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old man with his doings,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and have put on the new man, who is being renewed in knowledge after the image of his Creator,</verse>
  <verse number="11">where there can’t be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, bondservant, freeman; but Christ is all, and in all.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Put on therefore, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, a heart of compassion, kindness, lowliness, humility, and perseverance;</verse>
  <verse number="13">bearing with one another, and forgiving each other, if any man has a complaint against any; even as Christ forgave you, so you also do.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Above all these things, walk in love, which is the bond of perfection.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body; and be thankful.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Whatever you do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father, through him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Wives, be in subjection to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Husbands, love your wives, and don’t be bitter against them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Children, obey your parents in all things, for this pleases the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Fathers, don’t provoke your children, so that they won’t be discouraged.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Servants, obey in all things those who are your masters according to the flesh, not just when they are looking, as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord, and not for men,</verse>
  <verse number="24">knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for you serve the Lord Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that he has done, and there is no partiality.</verse>
