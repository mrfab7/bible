  <verse number="1">Then the High Priest asked him, “Are these statements true?”</verse>
  <verse number="2">The reply of Stephen was, “Sirs—brethren and fathers—listen to me. God Most Glorious appeared to our forefather Abraham when he was living in Mesopotamia, before he settled in Haran,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and said to him, “’Leave your country and your relatives, and go into whatever land I point out to you.’</verse>
  <verse number="4">“Thereupon he left Chaldaea and settled in Haran till after the death of his father, when God caused him to remove into this country where you now live.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But he gave him no inheritance in it, no, not a single square yard of ground. And yet He promised to bestow the land as a permanent possession on him and his posterity after him—and promised this at a time when Abraham was childless.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And God declared that Abraham’s posterity should for four hundred years make their home in a country not their own, and be reduced to slavery and be oppressed.</verse>
  <verse number="7">“’And the nation, whichever it is, that enslaves them, I will judge,’ said God; ‘and afterwards they shall come out, and they shall worship Me in this place.’</verse>
  <verse number="8">“Then He gave him the Covenant of circumcision, and under this Covenant he became the father of Isaac—whom he circumcised on the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve Patriarchs.</verse>
  <verse number="9">“The Patriarchs were jealous of Joseph and sold him into slavery in Egypt. But God was with him</verse>
  <verse number="10">and delivered him from all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him governor over Egypt and all the royal household.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But there came a famine throughout the whole of Egypt and Canaan—and great distress—so that our forefathers could find no food.</verse>
  <verse number="12">When, however, Jacob heard that there was wheat to be had, he sent our forefathers into Egypt; that was the first time.</verse>
  <verse number="13">On their second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Pharaoh was informed of Joseph’s parentage.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then Joseph sent and invited his father Jacob and all his family, numbering seventy-five persons, to come to him,</verse>
  <verse number="15">and Jacob went down into Egypt. There he died, and so did our forefathers,</verse>
  <verse number="16">and they were taken to Shechem and were laid in the tomb which Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a sum of money paid in silver.</verse>
  <verse number="17">“But as the time drew near for the fulfilment of the promise which God had made to Abraham, the people became many times more numerous in Egypt,</verse>
  <verse number="18">until there arose a foreign king over Egypt who knew nothing of Joseph.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He adopted a crafty policy towards our race, and oppressed our forefathers, making them cast out their infants so that they might not be permitted to live.</verse>
  <verse number="20">At this time Moses was born—a wonderfully beautiful child; and for three months he was cared for in his father’s house.</verse>
  <verse number="21">At length he was cast out, but Pharaoh’s daughter adopted him, and brought him up as her own son.</verse>
  <verse number="22">So Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, and possessed great influence through his eloquence and his achievements.</verse>
  <verse number="23">“And when he was just forty years old, it occurred to him to visit his brethren the descendants of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Seeing one of them wrongfully treated he took his part, and secured justice for the ill-treated man by striking down the Egyptian.</verse>
  <verse number="25">He supposed his brethren to be aware that by him God was sending them deliverance; this, however, they did not understand.</verse>
  <verse number="26">The next day, also, he came and found two of them fighting, and he endeavoured to make peace between them. “’Sirs,’ he said, ‘you are brothers. Why are you wronging one another?’</verse>
  <verse number="27">“But the man who was doing the wrong resented his interference, and asked, “’Who appointed you magistrate and judge over us?</verse>
  <verse number="28">Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’</verse>
  <verse number="29">“Alarmed at this question, Moses fled from the country and went to live in the land of Midian. There he became the father of two sons.</verse>
  <verse number="30">“But at the end of forty years there appeared to him in the Desert of Mount Sinai an angel in the middle of a flame of fire in a bush.</verse>
  <verse number="31">When Moses saw this he wondered at the sight; but on his going up to look further, the voice of the Lord was heard, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="32">“’I am the God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob.’ “Quaking with fear Moses did not dare gaze.</verse>
  <verse number="33">“’Take off your shoes,’ said the Lord, ‘for the spot on which you are standing is holy ground.</verse>
  <verse number="34">I have seen, yes, I have seen the oppression of My people who are in Egypt and have heard their groans, and I have come down to deliver them. And now I will send you to Egypt.’</verse>
  <verse number="35">“The Moses whom they rejected, asking him, ‘Who appointed you magistrate and judge?’—that same Moses we find God sending as a magistrate and a deliverer by the help of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.</verse>
  <verse number="36">This was he who brought them out, after performing marvels and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea, and in the Desert for forty years.</verse>
  <verse number="37">This is the Moses who said to the descendants of Israel, “’God will raise up a Prophet for you, from among your brethren, just as He raised me up.’</verse>
  <verse number="38">This is he who was among the Congregation in the Desert, together with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai and with our forefathers, who received ever-living utterances to hand on to us.</verse>
  <verse number="39">“Our forefathers, however, would not submit to him, but spurned his authority and in their hearts turned back to Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="40">They said to Aaron, “’Make gods for us, to march in front of us; for as for this Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.’</verse>
  <verse number="41">“Moreover they made a calf at that time, and offered a sacrifice to the idol and kept rejoicing in the gods which their own hands had made.</verse>
  <verse number="42">So God turned from them and gave them up to the worship of the Host of Heaven, as it is written in the Book of the Prophets, “’Were they victims and sacrifices which you offered Me, forty years in the Desert, O House of Israel?</verse>
  <verse number="43">Yes, you lifted up Moloch’s tent and the Star of the God Rephan—the images which you made in order to worship them; and I will remove you beyond Babylon.’</verse>
  <verse number="44">“Our forefathers had the Tent of the Testimony in the Desert, built as He who spoke to Moses had instructed him to make it in imitation of the model which he had seen.</verse>
  <verse number="45">That Tent was bequeathed to the next generation of our forefathers. Under Joshua they brought it with them when they were taking possession of the land of the Gentile nations, whom God drove out before them. So it continued till David’s time.</verse>
  <verse number="46">David obtained favour with God, and asked leave to provide a dwelling-place for the God of Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="47">But it was Solomon who built a house for Him.</verse>
  <verse number="48">Yet the Most High does not dwell in buildings erected by men’s hands. But, as the Prophet declares,</verse>
  <verse number="49">“’The sky is My throne, and earth is the footstool for My feet. What kind of house will you build for Me, says the Lord, or what resting place shall I have?</verse>
  <verse number="50">Did not My hand form this universe.’</verse>
  <verse number="51">“O stiff-necked men, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you also are continually at strife with the Holy Spirit—just as your forefathers were.</verse>
  <verse number="52">Which of the Prophets did not your forefathers persecute? Yes, they killed those who announced beforehand the advent of the righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become—</verse>
  <verse number="53">you who received the Law given through angels, and yet have not obeyed it.”</verse>
  <verse number="54">As they listened to these words, they became infuriated and gnashed their teeth at him.</verse>
  <verse number="55">But, full of the Holy Spirit and looking up to Heaven, Stephen saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at God’s right hand.</verse>
  <verse number="56">“I can see Heaven wide open,” he said, “and the Son of Man standing at God’s right hand.”</verse>
  <verse number="57">Upon this, with a loud outcry they stopped their ears, rushed upon Stephen in a body,</verse>
  <verse number="58">dragged him out of the city, and stoned him, the witnesses throwing off their outer garments and giving them into the care of a young man called Saul.</verse>
  <verse number="59">So they stoned Stephen, while he prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.”</verse>
  <verse number="60">Then, rising on his knees, he cried aloud, “Lord, do not reckon this sin against them.” And with these words he fell asleep.</verse>
