  <verse number="1">And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</verse>

  <verse number="3">and they have blown with them, and all the company have met together unto thee, unto the opening of the tent of meeting.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And if with one they blow, then have the princes, heads of the thousands of Israel, met together unto thee;</verse>
  <verse number="5">‘And ye have blown—a shout, and the camps which are encamping eastward have journeyed.</verse>
  <verse number="6">‘And ye have blown—a second shout, and the camps which are encamping southward have journeyed; a shout they blow for their journeys.</verse>
  <verse number="7">‘And in the assembling of the assembly ye blow, and do not shout;</verse>
  <verse number="8">and sons of Aaron, the priests, blow with the trumpets; and they have been to you for a statute age-during to your generations.</verse>
  <verse number="9">‘And when ye go into battle in your land against the adversary who is distressing you, then ye have shouted with the trumpets, and ye have been remembered before Jehovah your God, and ye have been saved from your enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And in the day of your gladness, and in your appointed seasons, and in the beginnings of your months, ye have blown also with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings, and they have been to you for a memorial before your God; I, Jehovah, am your God.’</verse>
