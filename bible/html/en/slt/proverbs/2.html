<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and wilt hide my commands with thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">To attend to wisdom thou wilt incline thine ear, thy heart to understanding;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For if thou will call to understanding, wilt give thy voice to understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If thou wilt seek her as silver, and dig for her as hidden treasure;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, and thou shalt find the knowledge of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For Jehovah will give wisdom: from his mouth knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He treasured up deliverance for the upright: a shield to those going in uprightness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">To guard the paths of judgment, and he will watch the way of his godly ones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then thou shalt understand justice and judgment and uprightness; every good track.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For wisdom shall come into thy heart, and knowledge shall be pleasant to thy soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Meditation shall watch over thee, understanding shall guard thee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">To deliver thee from the evil way, from the man speaking deceit;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Those forsaking the paths of straightness to go in the ways of darkness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Those rejoicing to do evil will exult in the deceit of evil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Whose paths are perverted, and in their tracks are bent aside:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">To deliver thee from the strange woman, from the stranger making smooth her sayings;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Forsaking the friend of her youth, and forgetting the covenant of her God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For her house sunk down to death, and her tracks to the shades.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">All going in it shall not turn back, and they shall not overtake the paths of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">So that thou shalt go in the way of the good, and thou shalt watch the paths of the just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the blameless shall remain in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the unjust shall be cut off from the land, and they transgressing shall be wiped off from it.</p>
