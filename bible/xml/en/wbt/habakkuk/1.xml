  <verse number="1">The burden which Habakkuk the prophet saw.</verse>
  <verse number="2">O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry out to thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!</verse>
  <verse number="3">Why dost thou show me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance? for devastation and violence are before me: and there are that raise strife and contention.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Therefore the law is slackened, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth encompass the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe though it be told you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwelling-places that are not theirs.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed from themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.</verse>
  <verse number="9">They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn to them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power to his god.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, my Holy One? We shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: why lookest thou on them that deal treacherously, and keepest silence when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?</verse>
  <verse number="14">And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping animals that have no ruler over them?</verse>
  <verse number="15">They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore they sacrifice to their net, and burn incense to their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their food plenteous.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?</verse>
