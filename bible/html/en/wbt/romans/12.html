<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable, and perfect will of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For through the grace given to me, I say, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honor preferring one another;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing earnest in prayer;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Bless them who persecute you; bless, and curse not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Rejoice with them that rejoice, and weep with them that weep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Be of the same mind one towards another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If it is possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place to wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Therefore if thy enemy hungereth, feed him; if he thirsteth, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</p>
