  <verse number="1">My brothers, not many of you should choose to become teachers, knowing that you shall receive a stricter judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For we all offend in many ways. If anyone does not offend in word, he is a perfect man. And he is then able, as if with a bridle, to lead the whole body around.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For so we put bridles into the mouths of horses, in order to submit them to our will, and so we turn their whole body around.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Consider also the ships, which, though they are great and may be driven by strong winds, yet they are turned around with a small rudder, to be directed to wherever the strength of the pilot might will.</verse>
  <verse number="5">So also the tongue certainly is a small part, but it moves great things. Consider that a small fire can set ablaze a great forest.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And so the tongue is like a fire, comprising all iniquity. The tongue, stationed in the midst of our body, can defile the entire body and inflame the wheel of our nativity, setting a fire from Hell.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For the nature of all beasts and birds and serpents and others is ruled over, and has been ruled over, by human nature.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But no man is able to rule over the tongue, a restless evil, full of deadly poison.</verse>
  <verse number="9">By it we bless God the Father, and by it we speak evil of men, who have been made in the likeness of God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">From the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so!</verse>
  <verse number="11">Does a fountain emit, out of the same opening, both sweet and bitter water?</verse>
  <verse number="12">My brothers, can the fig tree yield grapes? Or the vine, figs? Then neither is salt water able to produce fresh water.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who is wise and well-taught among you? Let him show, by means of good conversation, his work in the meekness of wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But if you hold a bitter zeal, and if there is contention in your hearts, then do not boast and do not be liars against the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For this is not wisdom, descending from above, but rather it is earthly, beastly, and diabolical.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For wherever envy and contention is, there too is inconstancy and every depraved work.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But within the wisdom that is from above, certainly, chastity is first, and next peacefulness, meekness, openness, consenting to what is good, a plenitude of mercy and good fruits, not judging, without falseness.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And so the fruit of justice is sown in peace by those who make peace.</verse>
