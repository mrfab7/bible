<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="10" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that our forefathers were all under the cloud, and that they all passed through the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="2">They were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="3">They all ate the same spiritual food</verse>
  <verse number="4">and drank the same spiritual drink; for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them, for they were struck down in the wilderness.</verse>
  <verse number="6">These things took place as examples to keep us from craving evil things as they did.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Do not be idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written: “The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">We should not commit sexual immorality, as some of them did, and in one day twenty-three thousand of them died.</verse>
  <verse number="9">We should not test Christ, as some of them did, and were killed by snakes.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And do not complain, as some of them did, and were killed by the destroying angel.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Now these things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us, on whom the fulfillment of the ages has come.</verse>
  <verse number="12">So the one who thinks he is standing firm should be careful not to fall.</verse>
  <verse number="13">No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; He will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, He will also provide an escape, so that you can stand up under it.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I speak to reasonable people; judge for yourselves what I say.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Is not the cup of blessing that we bless a participation in the blood of Christ? And is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of Christ?</verse>
  <verse number="17">Because there is one loaf, we who are many are one body; for we all partake of the one loaf.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Consider the people of Israel: Are not those who eat the sacrifices fellow partakers in the altar?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Am I suggesting, then, that food sacrificed to an idol is anything, or that an idol is anything?</verse>
  <verse number="20">No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God. And I do not want you to be participants with demons.</verse>
  <verse number="21">You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons too; you cannot partake in the table of the Lord and the table of demons too.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Are we trying to provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than He?</verse>
  <verse number="23">“Everything is permissible,” but not everything is beneficial. “Everything is permissible,” but not everything is edifying.</verse>
  <verse number="24">No one should seek his own good, but the good of others.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience,</verse>
  <verse number="26">for, “The earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof.”</verse>
  <verse number="27">If an unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go, eat anything set before you without raising questions of conscience.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But if someone tells you, “This food was offered to idols,” then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who told you and for the sake of conscience—</verse>
  <verse number="29">the other one’s conscience, I mean, not your own. For why should my freedom be determined by someone else’s conscience?</verse>
  <verse number="30">If I partake in the meal with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?</verse>
  <verse number="31">So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all to the glory of God.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Do not become a stumbling block, whether to Jews or Greeks or the church of God—</verse>
  <verse number="33">as I also try to please everyone in all I do. For I am not seeking my own good, but the good of many, that they may be saved.</verse>
