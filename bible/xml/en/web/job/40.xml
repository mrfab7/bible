  <verse number="1">Moreover Yahweh answered Job,</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Shall he who argues contend with the Almighty? He who argues with God, let him answer it.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then Job answered Yahweh,</verse>
  <verse number="4">“Behold, I am of small account. What shall I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I have spoken once, and I will not answer; Yes, twice, but I will proceed no further.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind,</verse>
  <verse number="7">“Now brace yourself like a man. I will question you, and you will answer me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Will you even annul my judgment? Will you condemn me, that you may be justified?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Or do you have an arm like God? Can you thunder with a voice like him?</verse>
  <verse number="10">“Now deck yourself with excellency and dignity. Array yourself with honor and majesty.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Pour out the fury of your anger. Look at everyone who is proud, and bring him low.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Look at everyone who is proud, and humble him. Crush the wicked in their place.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Hide them in the dust together. Bind their faces in the hidden place.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then I will also admit to you that your own right hand can save you.</verse>
  <verse number="15">“See now, behemoth, which I made as well as you. He eats grass as an ox.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Look now, his strength is in his thighs. His force is in the muscles of his belly.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He moves his tail like a cedar. The sinews of his thighs are knit together.</verse>
  <verse number="18">His bones are like tubes of brass. His limbs are like bars of iron.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He is the chief of the ways of God. He who made him gives him his sword.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Surely the mountains produce food for him, where all the animals of the field play.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He lies under the lotus trees, in the covert of the reed, and the marsh.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The lotuses cover him with their shade. The willows of the brook surround him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Behold, if a river overflows, he doesn’t tremble. He is confident, though the Jordan swells even to his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Shall any take him when he is on the watch, or pierce through his nose with a snare?</verse>
