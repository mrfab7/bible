  <verse number="1">Then Job answered,</verse>
  <verse number="2">“How long will you torment me, and crush me with words?</verse>
  <verse number="3">You have reproached me ten times. You aren’t ashamed that you attack me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">If it is true that I have erred, my error remains with myself.</verse>
  <verse number="5">If indeed you will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach;</verse>
  <verse number="6">know now that God has subverted me, and has surrounded me with his net.</verse>
  <verse number="7">“Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard. I cry for help, but there is no justice.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He has walled up my way so that I can’t pass, and has set darkness in my paths.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He has stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He has broken me down on every side, and I am gone. My hope he has plucked up like a tree.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He has also kindled his wrath against me. He counts me among his adversaries.</verse>
  <verse number="12">His troops come on together, build a siege ramp against me, and encamp around my tent.</verse>
  <verse number="13">“He has put my brothers far from me. My acquaintances are wholly estranged from me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">My relatives have gone away. My familiar friends have forgotten me.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Those who dwell in my house, and my maids, count me for a stranger. I am an alien in their sight.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I call to my servant, and he gives me no answer. I beg him with my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">My breath is offensive to my wife. I am loathsome to the children of my own mother.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Even young children despise me. If I arise, they speak against me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">All my familiar friends abhor me. They whom I loved have turned against me.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh. I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="21">“Have pity on me, have pity on me, you my friends; for the hand of God has touched me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Why do you persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?</verse>
  <verse number="23">“Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book!</verse>
  <verse number="24">That with an iron pen and lead they were engraved in the rock forever!</verse>
  <verse number="25">But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives. In the end, he will stand upon the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="26">After my skin is destroyed, then in my flesh shall I see God,</verse>
  <verse number="27">Whom I, even I, shall see on my side. My eyes shall see, and not as a stranger. “My heart is consumed within me.</verse>
  <verse number="28">If you say, ‘How we will persecute him!’ because the root of the matter is found in me,</verse>
  <verse number="29">be afraid of the sword, for wrath brings the punishments of the sword, that you may know there is a judgment.”</verse>
