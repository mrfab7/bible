  <verse number="1">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them; that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, who are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall assemble themselves to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="5">When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward.</verse>
  <verse number="6">When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But when the congregation is to be convened, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt-offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace-offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God.</verse>
