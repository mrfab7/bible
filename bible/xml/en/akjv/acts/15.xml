  <verse number="1">And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brothers, and said, Except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="2">When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy to all the brothers.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said to them, Men and brothers, you know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And God, which knows the hearts, bore them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did to us;</verse>
  <verse number="9">And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Now therefore why tempt you God, to put a yoke on the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</verse>
  <verse number="11">But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had worked among the Gentiles by them.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brothers, listen to me:</verse>
  <verse number="14">Simeon has declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,</verse>
  <verse number="16">After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:</verse>
  <verse number="17">That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, on whom my name is called, said the Lord, who does all these things.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Known to God are all his works from the beginning of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Why my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God:</verse>
  <verse number="20">But that we write to them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For Moses of old time has in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brothers send greeting to the brothers which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For as much as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, You must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:</verse>
  <verse number="25">It seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</verse>
  <verse number="26">Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="27">We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="28">For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay on you no greater burden than these necessary things;</verse>
  <verse number="29">That you abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if you keep yourselves, you shall do well. Fare you well.</verse>
  <verse number="30">So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter:</verse>
  <verse number="31">Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brothers with many words, and confirmed them.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brothers to the apostles.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And some days after Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brothers in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.</verse>
  <verse number="38">But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed to Cyprus;</verse>
  <verse number="40">And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brothers to the grace of God.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</verse>
