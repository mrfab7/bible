<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Better is a poor [man] that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Also that a person be without knowledge is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet maketh false steps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The folly of man distorteth his way, and his heart is irritated against Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Wealth addeth many friends; but the poor is separated from his friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A false witness shall not be held innocent, and he that uttereth lies shall not escape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Many court the favour of a noble; and every one is friend to a man that giveth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All the brethren of a poor [man] hate him; how much more do his friends go far from him: he pursueth [them] with words,—they are not [to be found].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that getteth sense loveth his own soul; he that keepeth understanding shall find good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A false witness shall not be held innocent, and he that uttereth lies shall perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Good living beseemeth not a fool; how much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The discretion of a man maketh him slow to anger, and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The king’s displeasure is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A foolish son is the calamity of his father; and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">House and wealth are an inheritance from fathers; but a prudent wife is from Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep, and the idle soul shall suffer hunger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his soul; he that is careless of his ways shall die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He that is gracious to the poor lendeth unto Jehovah; and what he hath bestowed will he repay unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Chasten thy son, seeing there is hope; but set not thy soul upon killing him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment; for if thou deliver [him], yet thou must do it again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Many are the thoughts in a man’s heart, but the counsel of Jehovah, that doth stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The charm of a man is his kindness; and a poor [man] is better than a liar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The fear of Jehovah [tendeth] to life, and he [that hath it] shall rest satisfied without being visited with evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">A sluggard burieth his hand in the dish, and will not even bring it to his mouth again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware; reprove the intelligent, and he will understand knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He that ruineth [his] father and chaseth away [his] mother is a son that causeth shame and bringeth reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Cease, my son, to hear the instruction which causeth to stray from the words of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A witness of Belial scorneth judgment, and the mouth of the wicked swalloweth down iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of the foolish.</p>
