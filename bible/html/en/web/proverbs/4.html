<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Listen, sons, to a father’s instruction. Pay attention and know understanding;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">for I give you sound learning. Don’t forsake my law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I was a son to my father, tender and an only child in the sight of my mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He taught me, and said to me: “Let your heart retain my words. Keep my commandments, and live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Get wisdom. Get understanding. Don’t forget, neither swerve from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Don’t forsake her, and she will preserve you. Love her, and she will keep you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wisdom is supreme. Get wisdom. Yes, though it costs all your possessions, get understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will bring you to honor, when you embrace her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">She will give to your head a garland of grace. She will deliver a crown of splendor to you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Listen, my son, and receive my sayings. The years of your life will be many.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I have taught you in the way of wisdom. I have led you in straight paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When you go, your steps will not be hampered. When you run, you will not stumble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Take firm hold of instruction. Don’t let her go. Keep her, for she is your life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Don’t enter into the path of the wicked. Don’t walk in the way of evil men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Avoid it, and don’t pass by it. Turn from it, and pass on.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For they don’t sleep, unless they do evil. Their sleep is taken away, unless they make someone fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But the path of the righteous is like the dawning light, that shines more and more until the perfect day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The way of the wicked is like darkness. They don’t know what they stumble over.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My son, attend to my words. Turn your ear to my sayings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Let them not depart from your eyes. Keep them in the midst of your heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For they are life to those who find them, and health to their whole body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it is the wellspring of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Put away from yourself a perverse mouth. Put corrupt lips far from you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Let your eyes look straight ahead. Fix your gaze directly before you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Make the path of your feet level. Let all of your ways be established.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Don’t turn to the right hand nor to the left. Remove your foot from evil.</p>
