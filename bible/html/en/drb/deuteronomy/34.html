<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab upon mount Nebo, to the top of Phasga over against Jericho: and the Lord shewed him all the land of Galaad as far as Dan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And all Nephtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasses, and all the land of Juda unto the furthermost sea,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the south part, and the breadth of the plain of Jericho the city of palm trees as far as Segor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the Lord said to him: This is the land, for which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying: I will give it to thy seed. Thou hast seen it with thy eyes, and shalt not pass over to it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Moses the servant of the Lord died there, in the land of Moab, by the commandment of the Lord:</p>
