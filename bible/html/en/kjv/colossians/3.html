<p class="verse" data-verse="1">If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">When Christ, [who is] our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For which thingsâ€™ sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And have put on the new [man], which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond [nor] free: but Christ [is] all, and in all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also [do] ye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And above all these things [put on] charity, which is the bond of perfectness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, [do] all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Husbands, love [your] wives, and be not bitter against them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Children, obey [your] parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Fathers, provoke not your children [to anger], lest they be discouraged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Servants, obey in all things [your] masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And whatsoever ye do, do [it] heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.</p>
