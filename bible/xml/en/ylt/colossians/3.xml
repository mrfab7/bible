<chapter book="Colossians" number="3" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">If, then, ye were raised with the Christ, the things above seek ye, where the Christ is, on the right hand of God seated,</verse>
  <verse number="2">the things above mind ye, not the things upon the earth,</verse>
  <verse number="3">for ye did die, and your life hath been hid with the Christ in God;</verse>
  <verse number="4">when the Christ—our life—may be manifested, then also we with him shall be manifested in glory.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Put to death, then, your members that are upon the earth—whoredom, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and the covetousness, which is idolatry—</verse>
  <verse number="6">because of which things cometh the anger of God upon the sons of the disobedience,</verse>
  <verse number="7">in which also ye—ye did walk once, when ye lived in them;</verse>
  <verse number="8">but now put off, even ye, the whole—anger, wrath, malice, evil-speaking, filthy talking—out of your mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Lie not one to another, having put off the old man with his practices,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and having put on the new, which is renewed in regard to knowledge, after the image of Him who did create him;</verse>
  <verse number="11">where there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, servant, freeman—but the all and in all—Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Put on, therefore, as choice ones of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humble-mindedness, meekness, long-suffering,</verse>
  <verse number="13">forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any one with any one may have a quarrel, as also the Christ did forgive you—so also ye;</verse>
  <verse number="14">and above all these things, have love, which is a bond of the perfection,</verse>
  <verse number="15">and let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also ye were called in one body, and become thankful.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing each other, in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, in grace singing in your hearts to the Lord;</verse>
  <verse number="17">and all, whatever ye may do in word or in work, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus—giving thanks to the God and Father, through him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The wives! be subject to your own husbands, as is fit in the Lord;</verse>
  <verse number="19">the husbands! love your wives, and be not bitter with them;</verse>
  <verse number="20">the children! obey the parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing to the Lord;</verse>
  <verse number="21">the fathers! vex not your children, lest they be discouraged.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The servants! obey in all things those who are masters according to the flesh, not in eye-service as men-pleasers, but in simplicity of heart, fearing God;</verse>
  <verse number="23">and all, whatever ye may do—out of soul work—as to the Lord, and not to men,</verse>
  <verse number="24">having known that from the Lord ye shall receive the recompense of the inheritance—for the Lord Christ ye serve;</verse>
  <verse number="25">and he who is doing unrighteously shall receive what he did unrighteously, and there is no acceptance of persons.</verse>
