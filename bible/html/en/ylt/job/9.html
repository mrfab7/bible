<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="9" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job answereth and saith:—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Truly I have known that it is so, And what—is man righteous with God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If he delight to strive with Him—He doth not answer him one of a thousand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Wise in heart and strong in power—Who hath hardened toward Him and is at peace?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who is removing mountains, And they have not known, Who hath overturned them in His anger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Who is shaking earth from its place, And its pillars move themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Who is speaking to the sun, and it riseth not, And the stars He sealeth up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Stretching out the heavens by Himself, And treading on the heights of the sea,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Making Osh, Kesil, and Kimah, And the inner chambers of the south.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Doing great things till there is no searching, And wonderful, till there is no numbering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Lo, He goeth over by me, and I see not, And He passeth on, and I attend not to it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Lo, He snatches away, who bringeth it back? Who saith unto Him, ‘What dost Thou?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">God doth not turn back His anger, Under Him bowed have proud helpers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">How much less do I—I answer Him? Choose out my words with Him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Whom, though I were righteous, I answer not, For my judgment I make supplication.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Though I had called and He answereth me, I do not believe that He giveth ear to my voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Because with a tempest He bruiseth me, And hath multiplied my wounds for nought.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He permitteth me not to refresh my spirit, But filleth me with bitter things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If of power, lo, the Strong One; And if of judgment—who doth convene me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">If I be righteous, Mine mouth doth declare me wicked, Perfect I am!—it declareth me perverse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Perfect I am!—I know not my soul, I despise my life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">It is the same thing, therefore I said, ‘The perfect and the wicked He is consuming.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If a scourge doth put to death suddenly, At the trial of the innocent He laugheth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Earth hath been given Into the hand of the wicked one. The face of its judges he covereth, If not—where, who is he?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">My days have been swifter than a runner, They have fled, they have not seen good,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">They have passed on with ships of reed, As an eagle darteth on food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Though I say, ‘I forget my talking, I forsake my corner, and I brighten up!’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">I have been afraid of all my griefs, I have known that Thou dost not acquit me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">I—I am become wicked; why is this? In vain I labour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">If I have washed myself with snow-water, And purified with soap my hands,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Then in corruption Thou dost dip me, And my garments have abominated me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">But if a man like myself—I answer him, We come together into judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If there were between us an umpire, He doth place his hand on us both.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">He doth turn aside from off me his rod, And His terror doth not make me afraid,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">I speak, and do not fear Him, But I am not right with myself.</p>
