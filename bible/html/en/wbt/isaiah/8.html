<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that flow gently, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah’s son;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks:</p>
