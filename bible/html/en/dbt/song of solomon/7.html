<p class="verse" data-verse="1">How beautiful are thy footsteps in sandals, O prince’s daughter! The roundings of thy thighs are like jewels, The work of the hands of an artist.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thy navel is a round goblet, [which] wanteth not mixed wine; Thy belly a heap of wheat, set about with lilies;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thy two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; Thine eyes, [like] the pools in Heshbon, By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Thy nose like the tower of Lebanon, Which looketh toward Damascus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, And the locks of thy head like purple; The king is fettered by [thy] ringlets!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">How fair and how pleasant art thou, [my] love, in delights!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">This thy stature is like to a palm-tree, And thy breasts to grape clusters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I said, I will go up to the palm-tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof; And thy breasts shall indeed be like clusters of the vine, And the fragrance of thy nose like apples,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine,... That goeth down smoothly for my beloved, And stealeth over the lips of them that are asleep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I am my beloved’s, And his desire is toward me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">—Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the fields; Let us lodge in the villages.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">We will go up early to the vineyards, We will see if the vine hath budded, [If] the blossom is opening, And the pomegranates are in bloom: There will I give thee my loves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The mandrakes yield fragrance; And at our gates are all choice fruits, new and old: I have laid them up for thee, my beloved.</p>
