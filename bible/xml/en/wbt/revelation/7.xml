  <verse number="9">After this I beheld, and lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and languages, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands;</verse>
  <verse number="10">And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God who sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb.</verse>

  <verse number="15">Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne will dwell among them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne will feed them, and will lead them to living fountains of waters: and God will wipe away all tears from their eyes.</verse>
