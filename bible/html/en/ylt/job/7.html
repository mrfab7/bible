<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Is there not a warfare to man on earth? And as the days of an hireling his days?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As a servant desireth the shadow, And as a hireling expecteth his wage,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">So I have been caused to inherit months of vanity, And nights of misery they numbered to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If I lay down then I said, ‘When do I rise!’ And evening hath been measured, And I have been full of tossings till dawn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Clothed hath been my flesh with worms, And a clod of dust, My skin hath been shrivelled and is loathsome,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">My days swifter than a weaving machine, And they are consumed without hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Remember Thou that my life is a breath, Mine eye turneth not back to see good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The eye of my beholder beholdeth me not. Thine eyes are upon me—and I am not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Consumed hath been a cloud, and it goeth, So he who is going down to Sheol cometh not up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He turneth not again to his house, Nor doth his place discern him again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Also I—I withhold not my mouth—I speak in the distress of my spirit, I talk in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A sea -monster am I, or a dragon, That thou settest over me a guard?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">When I said, ‘My bed doth comfort me,’ He taketh away in my talking my couch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And thou hast affrighted me with dreams, And from visions thou terrifiest me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And my soul chooseth strangling, Death rather than my bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I have wasted away—not to the age do I live. Cease from me, for my days are vanity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">What is man that Thou dost magnify him? And that Thou settest unto him Thy heart?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And inspectest him in the mornings, In the evenings dost try him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">How long dost Thou not look from me? Thou dost not desist till I swallow my spittle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I have sinned, what do I to Thee, O watcher of man? Why hast Thou set me for a mark to Thee, And I am for a burden to myself—and what?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Thou dost not take away my transgression, And cause to pass away mine iniquity, Because now, for dust I lie down: And Thou hast sought me—and I am not!</p>
