  <verse number="1">And Jesus entered and passed through Jericho.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And behold, there was a man named Zaccheus, who was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the crowd, because he was little of stature.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he ran before, and climbed up upon a sycamore-tree to see him; for he was to pass that way.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said to him, Zaccheus, make haste, and come down: for to-day I must abide at thy house.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Zaccheus stood, and said to the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him four-fold.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Jesus said to him, This day is salvation come to this house, forasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God would immediately appear.</verse>
  <verse number="12">He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said to them, Occupy till I come.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And it came to pass, that when he had returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called to him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he said to him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin:</verse>
  <verse number="21">For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou layedst not down, and reapest what thou didst not sow.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he saith to him, Out of thy own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest me to be an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping what I did not sow:</verse>
  <verse number="23">Why then gavest thou not my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required my own with interest?</verse>
  <verse number="24">And he said to them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.</verse>
  <verse number="25">(And they said to him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.)</verse>
  <verse number="26">For I say to you, That to every one who hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even what he hath shall be taken away from him.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But those my enemies, who would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending towards Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And it came to pass, when he had come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</verse>
  <verse number="30">Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in which at your entering ye will find a colt tied, on which yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And if any man shall ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say to him, Because the Lord hath need of him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And they that were sent, went and found even as he had said to them.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And as they were loosing the colt, the owners of it said to them, Why loose ye the colt?</verse>
  <verse number="34">And they said, The Lord hath need of him.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And when he had come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works that they had seen.</verse>
  <verse number="38">Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said to him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And he answered and said to them, I tell you, that if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And when he had come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it,</verse>
  <verse number="42">Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong to thy peace! but now they are hid from thy eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="43">For the days shall come upon thee, that thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and encompass thee, and keep thee in on every side,</verse>
  <verse number="44">And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee: and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another: because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold in it, and them that bought,</verse>
  <verse number="46">Saying to them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests, and the scribes, and the chief of the people sought to destroy him,</verse>
  <verse number="48">And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.</verse>
