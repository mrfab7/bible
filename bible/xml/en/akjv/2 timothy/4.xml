<chapter book="2 Timothy" number="4" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">I charge you therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</verse>
  <verse number="2">Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned to fables.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:</verse>
  <verse number="8">From now on there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but to all them also that love his appearing.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Do your diligence to come shortly to me:</verse>
  <verse number="10">For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when you come, bring with you, and the books, but especially the parchments.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</verse>
  <verse number="15">Of whom be you ware also; for he has greatly withstood our words.</verse>
  <verse number="16">At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me to his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Erastus stayed at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Do your diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brothers.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</verse>
