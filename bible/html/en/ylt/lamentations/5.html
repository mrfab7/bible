<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Remember, O Jehovah, what hath befallen us, Look attentively, and see our reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Our inheritance hath been turned to strangers, Our houses to foreigners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Orphans we have been—without a father, our mothers are as widows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Our water for money we have drunk, Our wood for a price doth come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For our neck we have been pursued, We have laboured—there hath been no rest for us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">To Egypt we have given a hand, To Asshur, to be satisfied with bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Our fathers have sinned—they are not, We their iniquities have borne.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Servants have ruled over us, A deliverer there is none from their hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">With our lives we bring in our bread, Because of the sword of the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Our skin as an oven hath been burning, Because of the raging of the famine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Wives in Zion they have humbled, Virgins—in cities of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Princes by their hand have been hanged, The faces of elders have not been honoured.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Young men to grind they have taken, And youths with wood have stumbled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The aged from the gate have ceased, Young men from their song.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Ceased hath the joy of our heart, Turned to mourning hath been our dancing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Fallen hath the crown from our head, Woe is now to us, for we have sinned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For this hath our heart been sick, For these have our eyes been dim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For the mount of Zion—that is desolate, Foxes have gone up on it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thou, O Jehovah, to the age remainest, Thy throne to generation and generation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Why for ever dost Thou forget us? Thou forsakest us for length of days!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Turn us back, O Jehovah, unto Thee, And we turn back, renew our days as of old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For hast Thou utterly rejected us? Thou hast been wroth against us—exceedingly?</p>
