  <verse number="1">Elihu also proceeded, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Suffer me a little, and I will show thee; For I have yet somewhat to say on God’s behalf.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I will fetch my knowledge from afar, And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For truly my words are not false: One that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: He is mighty in strength of understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He preserveth not the life of the wicked, But giveth to the afflicted their right.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: But with kings upon the throne He setteth them for ever, and they are exalted.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And if they be bound in fetters, And be taken in the cords of afflictions;</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then he showeth them their work, And their transgressions, that they have behaved themselves proudly.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He openeth also their ear to instruction, And commandeth that they return from iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If they hearken and serve him, They shall spend their days in prosperity, And their years in pleasures.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But if they hearken not, they shall perish by the sword, And they shall die without knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But they that are godless in heart lay up anger: They cry not for help when he bindeth them.</verse>
  <verse number="14">They die in youth, And their life perisheth among the unclean.</verse>
  <verse number="15">He delivereth the afflicted by their affliction, And openeth their ear in oppression.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Yea, he would have allured thee out of distress Into a broad place, where there is no straitness; And that which is set on thy table would be full of fatness.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But thou art full of the judgment of the wicked: Judgment and justice take hold on thee.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For let not wrath stir thee up against chastisements; Neither let the greatness of the ransom turn thee aside.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Will thy cry avail, that thou be not in distress, Or all the forces of thy strength?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Desire not the night, When peoples are cut off in their place.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Take heed, regard not iniquity: For this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Behold, God doeth loftily in his power: Who is a teacher like unto him?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Who hath enjoined him his way? Or who can say, Thou hast wrought unrighteousness?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Remember that thou magnify his work, Whereof men have sung.</verse>
  <verse number="25">All men have looked thereon; Man beholdeth it afar off.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Behold, God is great, and we know him not; The number of his years is unsearchable.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For he draweth up the drops of water, Which distil in rain from his vapor,</verse>
  <verse number="28">Which the skies pour down And drop upon man abundantly.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Yea, can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, The thunderings of his pavilion?</verse>
  <verse number="30">Behold, he spreadeth his light around him; And he covereth the bottom of the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="31">For by these he judgeth the peoples; He giveth food in abundance.</verse>
  <verse number="32">He covereth his hands with the lightning, And giveth it a charge that it strike the mark.</verse>
  <verse number="33">The noise thereof telleth concerning him, The cattle also concerning the storm that cometh up.</verse>
