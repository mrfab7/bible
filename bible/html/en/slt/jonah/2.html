<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jonah will pray to Jehovah his God from the bowels of the fish,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he will say, I called out of straits to me to Jehovah, and he will answer me; from the belly of hades I cried for help, thou heardest my voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And thou wilt cast me into the depth, into the heart of the seas; and the river will surround me: all thy breakers and thy waves passed over me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I said, I was driven from before thine eyes; yet I shall add to look to thy holy temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The waters encompassed me even to the soul: the deep will surround me, the sedge was bound to my head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I shall go down to the cuttings off of the mountains; the earth, her bars about me forever: and thou wilt bring up my life from corruption, O Jehovah my God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In my soul fainting upon me I remembered Jehovah: and my prayers will come in to thee to thy holy temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They watching the vanities of falsehood will forsake their kindness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And I will sacrifice to thee with the voice of praise; what I vowed I will requite. Salvation is to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Jehovah will say to the fish, and he will vomit forth Jonah upon the dry land.</p>
