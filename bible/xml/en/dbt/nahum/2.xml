  <verse number="1">He that dasheth in pieces is come up against thy face: keep the fortress, watch the way, make [thy] loins strong, fortify [thy] power mightily.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For Jehovah hath brought again the glory of Jacob, as the glory of Israel; for the wasters have wasted them, and marred their vine-branches.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots [glitter] with the sheen of steel, in the day of his preparation, and the spears are brandished.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The chariots rush madly in the streets, they justle one against another in the broad ways: the appearance of them is like torches, they run like lightnings.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He bethinketh him of his nobles: they stumble in their march; they make haste to the wall thereof, and the shelter is prepared.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The gates of the rivers are opened, and the palace melteth away.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And it is decreed: she shall be uncovered, she shall be led away, and her maids shall moan as with the voice of doves, drumming upon their breasts.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Nineveh hath been like a pool of water, since the day she existed, yet they flee away.... Stand! Stand! But none looketh back.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Plunder the silver, plunder the gold; for there is no end of the splendid store of all precious vessels.</verse>
  <verse number="10">She is empty, and void, and waste; and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and writhing pain is in all loins, and all their faces grow pale.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Where is [now] the den of the lions, and the feeding-place of the young lions, where the lion, the lioness, [and] the lion’s whelp walked, and none made them afraid?</verse>
  <verse number="12">The lion tore in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Behold, I am against thee, saith Jehovah of hosts: and I will burn her chariots into smoke; and the sword shall devour thy young lions, and I will cut off thy prey from the earth; and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.</verse>
