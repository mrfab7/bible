<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name, stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous are your works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are your ways, you King of saints.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who shall not fear you, O Lord, and glorify your name? for you only are holy: for all nations shall come and worship before you; for your judgments are made manifest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And one of the four beasts gave to the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God, and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.</p>
