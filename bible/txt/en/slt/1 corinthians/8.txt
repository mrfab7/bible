1	And concerning sacrifice to idols, we know, (for we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, and love builds the house.
2	And if any one thinks to know anything, as yet he has known nothing as he ought to know.
3	And if any one love God, the same is known of him.)
4	Concerning food therefore of sacrifices to idols, we know that an idol nothing in the world, and that none other God but one.
5	For also though they are called gods, whether in heaven, whether upon the earth, (for there are many gods, and many lords,)
6	But to us one God, the Father, of whom all things, and we for him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom all things, and we by him.
7	But not in all, knowledge: and some with consciousness of the idol even till now eat as a sacrifice to idols: and their consciousness being weak is contaminated.
8	And food sets us not before God: for neither, if we eat, do we abound; neither if we eat not, do we want.
9	And see ye lest this your power be a stumble to the weak.
10	For if any one see thee having knowledge reclining in the idolâ€™s temple, shall not his consciousness, being weak, be built up to eat the sacrifices to idols;
11	And shall the weak brother be destroyed upon thy knowledge, for whom Christ died?
12	And so sinning against the brethren, and striking their weak consciousness, ye sin against Christ.
13	Wherefore, if food offend my brother, I will eat no flesh forever, lest I shall offend my brother.
