<chapter book="Job" number="41" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Can you draw out the leviathan with a hook, and can you bind his tongue with a cord?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Can you place a ring in his nose, or bore through his jaw with an arm band?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Will he offer many prayers to you, or speak to you quietly?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Will he form a covenant with you, and will you accept him as a servant forever?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Will you play with him as with a bird, or tether him for your handmaids?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Will your friends cut him into pieces, will dealers distribute him?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Will you fill up bags with his hide, and let his head be used as a home for fishes?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Place your hand upon him; remember the battle and speak no more.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Behold, his hope will fail him, and in the sight of all, he will be thrown down.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I will not rouse him, as the cruel would do, for who is able to withstand my countenance?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Who has given to me beforehand, so that I should repay him? All things that are under heaven are mine.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I will not spare him, nor his powerful words and counterfeit attempts at supplication.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who can reveal the beauty of his garment? And who can enter the middle of his mouth?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Who can open the doors of his face? I gave fear to the circle of his teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">His body is like shields fused together, like dense scales pressed over one another.</verse>
  <verse number="16">One is joined to another, and not even air can pass between them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They adhere to one another, and they hold themselves in place and will not be separated.</verse>
  <verse number="18">His sneezing has the brilliance of fire, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Lamps proceed from his mouth, like torches of fire burning brightly.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Smoke passes out of his nostrils, like a pot that is heated and boiling.</verse>
  <verse number="21">His breath causes coal to burn, and a flame comes forth from his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Strength dwells in his neck, and destitution goes before his presence.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The parts of his body work in harmony together. He will send lightning bolts against him, and they will not be carried to another place.</verse>
  <verse number="24">His heart will be as hard as a stone and as dense as a blacksmith’s anvil.</verse>
  <verse number="25">When he will be raised up, the angels will be afraid, and, because they are terrified, they will purify themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="26">When a sword catches up with him, it will not be able to settle in, nor a spear, nor a breastplate.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For he will consider iron as if it were chaff, and brass as if it were rotten wood.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The archer will not cause him to flee; the stones of the sling have been turned into stubble for him.</verse>
  <verse number="29">He will treat the hammer as if it were stubble, and he will ridicule those who brandish the spear.</verse>
  <verse number="30">The beams of the sun will be under him, and he will dispense gold to them as if it were clay.</verse>
  <verse number="31">He will make the depths of the sea boil like a pot, and he will set it to bubble just as ointments do.</verse>
  <verse number="32">A path will shine after him; he will esteem the abyss as if it were weakening with age.</verse>
  <verse number="33">There is no power on the earth that is being compared to him, who has been made so that he fears no one.</verse>
  <verse number="34">He sees every prominent thing; he is king over all the sons of arrogance.</verse>
