  <verse number="1">The word that hath been unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">‘Thus spake Jehovah, God of Israel, saying, Write for thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee on a book.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For, lo, days are coming—an affirmation of Jehovah—and I have turned back to the captivity of My people Israel and Judah, said Jehovah, and I have caused them to turn back unto the land that I gave to their fathers, and they do possess it.’</verse>
  <verse number="4">And these are the words that Jehovah hath spoken concerning Israel and concerning Judah:</verse>
  <verse number="5">Surely thus said Jehovah: A voice of trembling we have heard, Fear—and there is no peace.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Ask, I pray you, and see, is a male bringing forth? Wherefore have I seen every man, His hands on his loins, as a travailing woman, And all faces have been turned to paleness?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Woe! for great is that day, without any like it, Yea, a time of adversity it is to Jacob, Yet out of it he is saved.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it hath come to pass, in that day, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts, I break his yoke from off thy neck, And thy bands I draw away, And lay no more service on him do strangers.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they have served Jehovah their God, And David their king whom I raise up to them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And thou, be not afraid, My servant Jacob, An affirmation of Jehovah, Nor be affrighted, O Israel, For, lo, I am saving thee from afar, And thy seed from the land of their captivity, And Jacob hath turned back and rested, And is quiet, and there is none troubling.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For with thee am I, An affirmation of Jehovah—to save thee, For I make an end of all the nations Whither I have scattered thee, Only, of thee I do not make an end, And I have chastised thee in judgment, And do not entirely acquit thee.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For thus said Jehovah: Incurable is thy breach, grievous thy stroke,</verse>
  <verse number="13">There is none judging thy cause to bind up, Healing medicines there are none for thee.</verse>
  <verse number="14">all loving thee have forgotten thee, Thee they do not seek, For with the stroke of an enemy I smote thee, The chastisement of a fierce one, Because of the abundance of thy iniquity, Mighty have been thy sins!</verse>
  <verse number="15">What!—thou criest concerning thy breach! Incurable is thy pain, Because of the abundance of thy iniquity, Mighty have been thy sins! I have done these to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore all consuming thee are consumed, And all thine adversaries—all of them—Into captivity do go, And thy spoilers have been for a spoil, And all thy plunderers I give up to plunder.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For I increase health to thee, And from thy strokes I do heal thee, An affirmation of Jehovah, For ‘Outcast’ they have called to thee, ‘Zion it is, there is none seeking for her.’</verse>
  <verse number="18">Thus said Jehovah: Lo, I turn back to the captivity of the tents of Jacob, And his dwelling places I pity, And the city hath been built on its heap, And the palace according to its ordinance remaineth.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And gone forth from them hath thanksgiving, And the voice of playful ones, And I have multiplied them and they are not few, And made them honourable, and they are not small.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And his sons have been as aforetime, And his company before Me is established, And I have seen after all his oppressors.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And his honourable one hath been of himself, And his ruler from his midst goeth forth, And I have caused him to draw near, And he hath drawn nigh unto Me, For who is he who hath pledged his heart To draw nigh unto Me? An affirmation of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And ye have been to Me for a people, And I am to you for God.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Lo, a whirlwind of Jehovah—Fury hath gone forth—a cutting whirlwind, On the head of the wicked it stayeth.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The fierceness of the anger of Jehovah Doth not turn back till His doing, Yea, till His establishing the devices of His heart, In the latter end of the days we consider it!</verse>
