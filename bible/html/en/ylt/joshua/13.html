<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Joshua is old, entering into days, and Jehovah saith unto him, ‘Thou hast become aged, thou hast entered into days; as to the land, very much hath been left to possess.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">This is the land that is left; all the circuits of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,</p>
