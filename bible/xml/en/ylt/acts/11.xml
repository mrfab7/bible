  <verse number="1">And the apostles and the brethren who are in Judea heard that also the nations did receive the word of God,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision were contending with him,</verse>
  <verse number="3">saying—‘Unto men uncircumcised thou didst go in, and didst eat with them!’</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Peter having begun, did expound to them in order saying,</verse>
  <verse number="5">‘I was in the city of Joppa praying, and I saw in a trance a vision, a certain vessel coming down, as a great sheet by four corners being let down out of the heaven, and it came unto me;</verse>
  <verse number="6">at which having looked stedfastly, I was considering, and I saw the four-footed beasts of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the fowls of heaven;</verse>
  <verse number="7">and I heard a voice saying to me, Having risen, Peter, slay and eat;</verse>
  <verse number="8">and I said, Not so, Lord; because anything common or unclean hath at no time entered into my mouth;</verse>
  <verse number="9">and a voice did answer me a second time out of the heaven, What God did cleanse, thou—declare not thou common.</verse>
  <verse number="10">‘And this happened thrice, and again was all drawn up to the heaven,</verse>
  <verse number="11">and, lo, immediately, three men stood at the house in which I was, having been sent from Caesarea unto me,</verse>
  <verse number="12">and the Spirit said to me to go with them, nothing doubting, and these six brethren also went with me, and we did enter into the house of the man,</verse>
  <verse number="13">he declared also to us how he saw the messenger in his house standing, and saying to him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter,</verse>
  <verse number="14">who shall speak sayings by which thou shalt be saved, thou and all thy house.</verse>
  <verse number="15">‘And in my beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit did fall upon them, even as also upon us in the beginning,</verse>
  <verse number="16">and I remembered the saying of the Lord, how he said, John indeed did baptize with water, and ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="17">if then the equal gift God did give to them as also to us, having believed upon the Lord Jesus Christ, I—how was I able to withstand God?’</verse>
  <verse number="18">And they, having heard these things, were silent, and were glorifying God, saying, ‘Then, indeed, also to the nations did God give the reformation to life.’</verse>
  <verse number="19">Those, indeed, therefore, having been scattered abroad, from the tribulation that came after Stephen, went through unto Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none except to Jews only;</verse>
  <verse number="20">and there were certain of them men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who having entered into Antioch, were speaking unto the Hellenists, proclaiming good news—the Lord Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="21">and the hand of the Lord was with them, a great number also, having believed, did turn unto the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the account was heard in the ears of the assembly that is in Jerusalem concerning them, and they sent forth Barnabas to go through unto Antioch,</verse>
  <verse number="23">who, having come, and having seen the grace of God, was glad, and was exhorting all with purpose of heart to cleave to the Lord,</verse>
  <verse number="24">because he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit, and of faith, and a great multitude was added to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And Barnabas went forth to Tarsus, to seek for Saul,</verse>
  <verse number="26">and having found him, he brought him to Antioch, and it came to pass that they a whole year did assemble together in the assembly, and taught a great multitude, the disciples also were divinely called first in Antioch Christians.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And in those days there came from Jerusalem prophets to Antioch,</verse>
  <verse number="28">and one of them, by name Agabus, having stood up, did signify through the Spirit a great dearth is about to be throughout all the world—which also came to pass in the time of Claudius Caesar—</verse>
  <verse number="29">and the disciples, according as any one was prospering, determined each of them to send for ministration to the brethren dwelling in Judea,</verse>
  <verse number="30">which also they did, having sent unto the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</verse>
