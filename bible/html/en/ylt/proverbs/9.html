<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="9" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wisdom hath builded her house, She hath hewn out her pillars—seven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">She hath slaughtered her slaughter, She hath mingled her wine, Yea, she hath arranged her table.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">She hath sent forth her damsels, She crieth on the tops of the high places of the city:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who is simple? let him turn aside hither.’ Whoso lacketh heart: she hath said to him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">‘Come, eat of my bread, And drink of the wine I have mingled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Forsake ye, the simple, and live, And be happy in the way of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The instructor of a scorner Is receiving for it—shame, And a reprover of the wicked—his blemish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee, Give reproof to the wise, and he loveth thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Give to the wise, and he is wiser still, Make known to the righteous, And he increaseth learning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The commencement of wisdom is the fear of Jehovah, And a knowledge of the Holy Ones is understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For by me do thy days multiply, And added to thee are years of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If thou hast been wise, thou hast been wise for thyself, And thou hast scorned—thyself bearest it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A foolish woman is noisy, Simple, and hath not known what.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And she hath sat at the opening of her house, On a throne—the high places of the city,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">To call to those passing by the way, Who are going straight on their paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Who is simple? let him turn aside hither.’ And whoso lacketh heart—she said to him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">‘Stolen waters are sweet, And hidden bread is pleasant.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he hath not known that Rephaim are there, In deep places of Sheol her invited ones!</p>
