<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Son of man, what is the tree of the vine above every tree, the vine-shoot which was upon the trees of the forest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Shall wood be taken from it to do for work? or will they take from it a peg to hang upon it any vessel?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Behold, it was given to the fire to consume; the fire consumed its two ends, and the midst of it was burned. Will it succeed for work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Behold, in its being whole, it will not do for work: but if the fire consumed it, and it was burnt, did it yet do for work?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: As the tree of the vine upon the tree of the forest which I gave it to the fire for consuming, thus I gave the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I gave my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire, and the fire shall consume them; and they knew that I am Jehovah in my setting my face against them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And I gave the land a desolation, because they transgressed a transgression, says the Lord Jehovah.</p>
