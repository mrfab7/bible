<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="3" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After this Job opened his mouth, and he will curse his day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Job will answer and say,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The day shall perish I shall bring forth in it, and the night said, A male was conceived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">That day shall be darkness; God shall not search it out from above, and the light shall not shine upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Darkness shall pollute it, and the shadow of death; a cloud shall dwell upon it; the obscurations of day shall terrify it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">That night darkness shall take it; it shall not be joined upon the days of the year; it shall not come into the number of months.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, that night shall be hard; no rejoicing shall be in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They cursing the day shall curse it, they being ready to rouse up the sea monster.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The stars of its twilight shall he dark; it shall wait for light, and none; and it shall not look upon the eyelashes of the dawn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Because it shut not up the doors of my belly; and shall it hide the labor of mine eyes?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Wherefore shall I not die from the womb? and I came forth from the belly, and I shall expire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Why did the knees anticipate me? and wherefore the breasts that I shall suck?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For now I lay down and I shall rest; I slept: then there will be rest to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">With kings and counselors of the earth building the wastes for themselves;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Or with chiefs, gold to them, filling their houses with silver:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Or as a hidden abortion I shall not be; as children they saw not light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">There the unjust ceased to be angry, and the weary in strength shall rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">They being bound, rested together; they heard not the voice of the taskmaster.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The little and the great, he is there; and the servant being free from his lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Wherefore shall light be given to him toiling, and life to the bitter of soul?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Waiting for death, and it is not; and they will dig more than for hidden treasures;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Rejoicing with joy when they find the grave;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">To a man whose way was hid, and God will hedge about him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For my sighing will come before any bread, and my groanings shall be poured put as waters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For I feared a fear, and it will come upon me, and what I was afraid of will come to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I was not secure, and I rested not, and I was not quiet; and trouble will come.</p>
