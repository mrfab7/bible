  <verse number="1">Come, let us return to the LORD. For He has torn us to pieces, but He will heal us; He has wounded us, but He will bind up our wounds.</verse>
  <verse number="2">After two days He will revive us; on the third day He will raise us up, that we may live in His presence.</verse>
  <verse number="3">So let us know—let us press on to know the LORD. As surely as the sun rises, He will appear; He will come to us like the rain, like the spring showers that water the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">What shall I do with you, O Ephraim? What shall I do with you, O Judah? For your loyalty is like a morning mist, like the early dew that vanishes.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of My mouth, and My judgments go forth like lightning.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For I desire mercy, not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But they, like Adam, have transgressed the covenant; there they were unfaithful to Me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Gilead is a city of evildoers, tracked with footprints of blood.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Like raiders who lie in ambush, so does a band of priests; they murder on the way to Shechem; surely they have committed atrocities.</verse>
  <verse number="10">In the house of Israel I have seen a horrible thing: Ephraim practices prostitution there, and Israel is defiled.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Also for you, O Judah, a harvest is appointed, when I restore My people from captivity.</verse>
