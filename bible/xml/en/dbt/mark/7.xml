<chapter book="Mark" number="7" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And the Pharisees and some of the scribes, coming from Jerusalem, are gathered together to him,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and seeing some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands,</verse>
  <verse number="3">(for the Pharisees and all the Jews, unless they wash their hands diligently, do not eat, holding what has been delivered by the ancients;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and [on coming] from the market-place, unless they are washed, they do not eat; and there are many other things which they have received to hold, the washing of cups and vessels, and brazen utensils, and couches),</verse>
  <verse number="5">then the Pharisees and the scribes ask him, Why do thy disciples not walk according to what has been delivered by the ancients, but eat the bread with defiled hands?</verse>
  <verse number="6">But he answering said to them, Well did Esaias prophesy concerning you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honour me with their lips, but their heart is far away from me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But in vain do they worship me, teaching [as their] teachings commandments of men.</verse>
  <verse number="8">[For], leaving the commandment of God, ye hold what is delivered by men [to keep]—washings of vessels and cups, and many other such like things ye do.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he said to them, Well do ye set aside the commandment of God, that ye may observe what is delivered by yourselves [to keep].</verse>
  <verse number="10">For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, he who speaks ill of father or mother, let him surely die.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But ye say, If a man say to his father or his mother, [It is] corban (that is, gift), whatsoever thou mightest have profit from me by...</verse>
  <verse number="12">And ye no longer suffer him to do anything for his father or his mother;</verse>
  <verse number="13">making void the word of God by your traditional teaching which ye have delivered; and many such like things ye do.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And having called again the crowd, he said to them, Hear me, all [of you], and understand:</verse>
  <verse number="15">There is nothing from outside a man entering into him which can defile him; but the things which go out from him, those it is which defile the man.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If any one have ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And when he went indoors from the crowd, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he says to them, Are ye also thus unintelligent? Do ye not perceive that all that is outside entering into the man cannot defile him,</verse>
  <verse number="19">because it does not enter into his heart but into his belly, and goes out into the draught, purging all meats?</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he said, That which goes forth out of the man, that defiles the man.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For from within, out of the heart of men, go forth evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</verse>
  <verse number="22">thefts, covetousness, wickednesses, deceit, licentiousness, a wicked eye, injurious language, haughtiness, folly;</verse>
  <verse number="23">all these wicked things go forth from within and defile the man.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And he rose up and went away thence into the borders of Tyre and Sidon; and having entered into a house he would not have any one know [it], and he could not be hid.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But immediately a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell at his feet</verse>
  <verse number="26">(and the woman was a Greek, Syrophenician by race), and asked him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But [Jesus] said to her, Suffer the children to be first filled; for it is not right to take the children’s bread and cast it to the dogs.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But she answered and says to him, Yea, Lord; for even the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he said to her, Because of this word, go thy way, the demon is gone out of thy daughter.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And having gone away to her house she found the demon gone out, and her daughter lying on the bed.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And again having left the borders of Tyre and Sidon, he came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And they bring to him a deaf [man] who could not speak right, and they beseech him that he might lay his hand on him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And having taken him away from the crowd apart, he put his fingers to his ears; and having spit, he touched his tongue;</verse>
  <verse number="34">and looking up to heaven he groaned, and says to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And immediately his ears were opened, and the band of his tongue was loosed and he spoke right.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And he charged them that they should speak to no one [of it]. But so much the more he charged them, so much the more abundantly they proclaimed it;</verse>
  <verse number="37">and they were astonished above measure, saying, He does all things well; he makes both the deaf to hear, and the speechless to speak.</verse>
