<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, an apostle—sent not from men nor by man, but by Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and all the brothers with me, To the churches of Galatia:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">who gave Himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I am amazed how quickly you are deserting the One who called you by the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">which is not even a gospel. Evidently some people are troubling you and trying to distort the gospel of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be under a curse!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be under a curse!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Am I now seeking the approval of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached was not devised by man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how severely I persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by His grace, was pleased</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">to reveal His Son in me so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not rush to consult with flesh and blood,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">nor did I go up to Jerusalem to the apostles who came before me, but I went into Arabia and later returned to Damascus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Only after three years did I go up to Jerusalem to confer with Cephas, and I stayed with him fifteen days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord’s brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I assure you before God that what I am writing to you is no lie.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Later I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">I was personally unknown, however, to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">They only heard the account: “The man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And they glorified God because of me.</p>
