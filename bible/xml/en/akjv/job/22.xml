  <verse number="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Can a man be profitable to God, as he that is wise may be profitable to himself?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that you are righteous? or is it gain to him, that you make your ways perfect?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Will he reprove you for fear of you? will he enter with you into judgment?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Is not your wickedness great? and your iniquities infinite?</verse>
  <verse number="6">For you have taken a pledge from your brother for nothing, and stripped the naked of their clothing.</verse>
  <verse number="7">You have not given water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honorable man dwelled in it.</verse>
  <verse number="9">You have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore snares are round about you, and sudden fear troubles you;</verse>
  <verse number="11">Or darkness, that you can not see; and abundance of waters cover you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!</verse>
  <verse number="13">And you say, How does God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he sees not; and he walks in the circuit of heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Have you marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?</verse>
  <verse number="16">Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflowed with a flood:</verse>
  <verse number="17">Which said to God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumes.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Acquaint now yourself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come to you.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Receive, I pray you, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If you return to the Almighty, you shall be built up, you shall put away iniquity far from your tabernacles.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then shall you lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Yes, the Almighty shall be your defense, and you shall have plenty of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For then shall you have your delight in the Almighty, and shall lift up your face to God.</verse>
  <verse number="27">You shall make your prayer to him, and he shall hear you, and you shall pay your vows.</verse>
  <verse number="28">You shall also decree a thing, and it shall be established to you: and the light shall shine on your ways.</verse>
  <verse number="29">When men are cast down, then you shall say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.</verse>
  <verse number="30">He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of your hands.</verse>
