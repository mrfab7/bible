  <verse number="1">Brethren, if a man be taken in any fault, ye the spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; observing thyself narrowly, lest thou also be tempted.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Bear one another’s burdens, and so fill up the law of Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="3">For if any think to be something, being nothing, he deceives himself.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And let each try his own work, and then in himself alone will he have boasting, and not in another.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For each shall bear his own load.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Let him being taught the word participate with him teaching in all good things.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man should sow, that also shall he reap.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For he sowing to his flesh of the flesh shall reap corruption; but he sowing to the Spirit, of the Spirit shall reap eternal life.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And doing good let us not despond: for in proper time we shall reap, not being enervated.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Wherefore then as we have time, let us work good to all, and chiefly to them of the household of faith.</verse>
  <verse number="11">See ye how large letters I wrote to you with mine own hand.</verse>
  <verse number="12">As many as: wish to have an agreeable demeanor in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only lest they should be driven out for the cross of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For neither they being circumcised themselves observe the law; but they wish you to be circumcised, that they might boast in your flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And it may not be to me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any power, nor uncircumcision but a new creation.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And as many as walk by this model, place upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For the rest let none cause me fatigues: for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus Christ in my body.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with your spirit, brethren. Amen.</verse>
