<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To the place of the altar, which he had make there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell together: for their substance was great, so that they could not dwell together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And there was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdsmen of Lot’s cattle: and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelled then in the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Abram said to Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray you, between me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen; for we be brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Is not the whole land before you? separate yourself, I pray you, from me: if you will take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if you depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as you come to Zoar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD exceedingly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And the LORD said to Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now your eyes, and look from the place where you are northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For all the land which you see, to you will I give it, and to your seed for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And I will make your seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall your seed also be numbered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelled in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar to the LORD.</p>
