<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="6" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job replied:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“If only my grief could be weighed and placed with my calamity on the scales.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For then it would outweigh the sand of the seas—no wonder my words have been rash.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For the arrows of the Almighty have pierced me; my spirit drinks in their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Does a wild donkey bray over fresh grass, or an ox low over its fodder?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Is tasteless food eaten without salt, or is there flavor in the white of an egg?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">My soul refuses to touch them; they are loathsome food to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">If only my request were granted and God would fulfill my hope:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">that God would be willing to crush me, to unleash His hand and cut me off!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">It still brings me comfort, and joy through unrelenting pain, that I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">What strength do I have, that I should still hope? What is my future, that I should be patient?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Is my strength like that of stone, or my flesh made of bronze?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Is there any help within me now that success is driven from me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">A despairing man should have the kindness of his friend, even if he forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But my brothers are as faithless as wadis, as seasonal streams that overflow,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">darkened because of the ice and the inflow of melting snow,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">but ceasing in the dry season and vanishing from their channels in the heat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Caravans turn aside from their routes; they go into the wasteland and perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The caravans of Tema look for water; the travelers of Sheba hope to find it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">They are confounded because they had hoped; their arrival brings disappointment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For now you are of no help; you see terror, and you are afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Have I ever said, ‘Give me something; offer me a bribe from your wealth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">deliver me from the hand of the enemy; redeem me from the grasp of the ruthless’?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Teach me, and I will be silent. Help me understand how I have erred.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">How painful are honest words! But what does your argument prove?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Do you intend to correct my words, and treat as wind my cry of despair?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">You would even cast lots for an orphan and barter away your friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">But now, please look at me. Would I lie to your face?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Reconsider; do not be unjust. Reconsider, for my righteousness is at stake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Is there iniquity on my tongue? Can my mouth not discern malice?</p>
