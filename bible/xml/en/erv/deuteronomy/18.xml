<chapter book="Deuteronomy" number="18" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The priests the Levites, even all the tribe of Levi, shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And they shall have no inheritance among their brethren: the LORD is their inheritance, as he hath spoken unto them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And this shall be the priests’ due from the people, from them that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks, and the maw.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The firstfruits of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourneth, and come with all the desire of his soul unto the place which the LORD shall choose;</verse>
  <verse number="7">then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all his brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="8">They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh of the sale of his patrimony.</verse>
  <verse number="9">When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.</verse>
  <verse number="10">There shall not be found with thee any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, one that useth divination, one that practiseth augury, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer,</verse>
  <verse number="11">or a charmer, or a consulter with a familiar spirit, or a wizard, or a necromancer.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearken unto them that practise augury, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye shall hearken;</verse>
  <verse number="16">according to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the LORD said unto me, They have well said that which they have spoken.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But the prophet, which shall speak a word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the LORD hath not spoken?</verse>
  <verse number="22">when a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken: the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously, thou shalt not be afraid of him.</verse>
