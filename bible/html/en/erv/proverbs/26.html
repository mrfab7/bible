<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The legs of the lame hang loose: so is a parable in the mouth of fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">As a bag of gems in a heap of stones, so is he that giveth honour to a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">As a thorn that goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the month of fools.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A lying tongue hateth those whom it hath wounded; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.</p>
