  <verse number="1">Jesus said to His disciples, “It is inevitable that causes of stumbling should come; but alas for him through whom they come!</verse>
  <verse number="2">It would be well for him if, with a millstone round his neck, he were lying at the bottom of the sea, rather than that he should cause even one of these little ones to fall.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Be on your guard. “If your brother acts wrongly, reprove him; and if he is sorry, forgive him;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and if seven times in a day he acts wrongly towards you, and seven times turns again to you and says, ‘I am sorry,’ you must forgive him.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the Apostles said to the Lord, “Give us faith.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">“If your faith,” replied the Lord, “is like a mustard seed, you might command this black-mulberry-tree, ‘Tear up your roots and plant yourself in the sea,’ and instantly it would obey you.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But which of you who has a servant ploughing, or tending sheep, will say to him when he comes in from the farm, ‘Come at once and take your place at table,’</verse>
  <verse number="8">and will not rather say to him, ‘Get my dinner ready, make yourself tidy, and wait upon me till I have finished my dinner, and then you shall have yours’?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Does he thank the servant for obeying his orders?</verse>
  <verse number="10">So you also, when you have obeyed all the orders given you, must say, “’There is no merit in our service: what we have done is only what we were in duty bound to do.’”</verse>
  <verse number="11">As they pursued their journey to Jerusalem, He passed through Samaria and Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And as He entered a certain village, ten men met Him who were lepers and stood at a distance.</verse>
  <verse number="13">In loud voices they cried out, “Jesus, Rabbi, take pity on us.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">Perceiving this, He said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the Priests.” And while on their way to do this they were made clean.</verse>
  <verse number="15">One of them, seeing that he was cured, came back, adoring and praising God in a loud voice,</verse>
  <verse number="16">and he threw himself at the feet of Jesus, thanking Him. He was a Samaritan.</verse>
  <verse number="17">“Were not all ten made clean?” Jesus asked; “but where are the nine?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Have none been found to come back and give glory to God except this foreigner?”</verse>
  <verse number="19">And He said to him, “Rise and go: your faith has cured you.”</verse>
  <verse number="20">Being asked by the Pharisees when the Kingdom of God was coming, He answered, “The Kingdom of God does not so come that you can stealthily watch for it.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Nor will they say, ‘See here!’ or ‘See there!’—for the Kingdom of God is within you.”</verse>
  <verse number="22">Then, turning to His disciples, He said, “There will come a time when you will wish you could see a single one of the days of the Son of Man, but will not see one.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they will say to you, ‘See there!’ ‘See here!’ Do not start off and go in pursuit.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For just as the lightning, when it flashes, shines from one part of the horizon to the opposite part, so will the Son of Man be on His day.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But first He must endure much suffering, and be rejected by the present generation.</verse>
  <verse number="26">“And as it was in the time of Noah, so will it also be in the time of the Son of Man.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Men were eating and drinking, taking wives and giving wives, up to the very day on which Noah entered the Ark, and the Deluge came and destroyed them all.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The same was true in the time of Lot: they were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building;</verse>
  <verse number="29">but on the day that Lot left Sodom, God rained fire and brimstone from the sky and destroyed them all.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Exactly so will it be on the day that the veil is lifted from the Son of Man.</verse>
  <verse number="31">“On that day, if a man is on the roof and his property indoors, let him not go down to fetch it; and, in the same way, he who is in the field, let him not turn back.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Remember Lot’s wife.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Any man who makes it his object to keep his own life safe, will lose it; but whoever loses his life will preserve it.</verse>
  <verse number="34">On that night, I tell you, there will be two men in one bed: one will be taken away and the other left behind.</verse>
  <verse number="35">There will be two women turning the mill together: one will be taken away and the other left behind.”</verse>
  <verse number="36"></verse>
  <verse number="37">“Where, Master?” they inquired. “Where the dead body is,” He replied, “there also will the vultures flock together.”</verse>
