<chapter book="Jeremiah" number="18" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Rise up and descend into the house of the potter, and there you will hear my words.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I descended into the house of the potter, and behold, he was making a work on the wheel.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the vessel, which he was making with his hands out of clay, broke. And turning away, he made another vessel, for it had been pleasing in his eyes to make it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="6">“Am I not able to do with you, O house of Israel, just as this potter has done, says the Lord? Behold, like clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Suddenly, I will speak against a nation and against a kingdom, so that I may uproot, and destroy, and scatter it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">If that nation, against which I have spoken, will repent from their evil, I too will repent from the evil that I have decided I would do to them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And soon, I will speak about a nation and about a kingdom, so that I may build and plant it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If it does evil in my sight, so as not to listen to my voice, I will repent of the good that I have said I would do to it.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Now, therefore, speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying: Thus says the Lord: Behold, I am forming an evil against you, and I am considering a plan against you. Let each one of you return from his evil way, and direct your ways and your intentions well.”</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they said: “We have lost hope. And so we will follow our own thoughts, and each of us will act according to the depravity of his own evil heart.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">For this reason, thus says the Lord: “Inquire among the Gentiles. Who has heard of such horrible things as the virgin of Israel has done to excess?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Do the snows of Lebanon fail to fall on the rocks of the field? Or are the cold waters, which burst forth and flow down, able to be rooted out?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Yet my people have forgotten me, offering useless libations, and stumbling in their ways, in the paths of the world, so that they walk by these on an unmarked route.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And so their land has been given over to desolation and to perpetual hissing. Each one who passes by will be astonished and will shake his head.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Like a burning wind, I will disperse them in the sight the enemy. I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their perdition.”</verse>
  <verse number="18">And they said: “Come, and let us devise a plan against Jeremiah. For the law will not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor a sermon from the prophet. Come, and let us strike him with the tongue, and let us pay no attention to any of his words.”</verse>
  <verse number="19">Attend to me, O Lord, and hear the voice of my adversaries.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Should evil be rendered for good? For they have dug a pit for my soul! Remember that I have stood in your sight, so as to speak on their behalf for good, and to avert your indignation from them.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Because of this, give their sons over to famine, and bring them to the hand of the sword. Let their wives be widows without children. And let their husbands be slain by death. Let their youths be stabbed with the sword in battle.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Let an outcry be heard from their houses. For you will lead the robber upon them suddenly. For they have dug a pit, so that they may seize me, and they have hidden snares for my feet.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But you, O Lord, know all their plans against me unto death. May you not forgive their iniquity, and do not allow their sin be taken away from your face. Let them be thrown down in your sight, in the time of your fury, so that you may destroy them.</verse>
