  <verse number="1">And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">And thou, son of man, thus saith the Lord Jehovah unto the land of Israel: An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Now is the end upon thee; and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will bring upon thee all thine abominations.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity; but I will bring thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: An evil, an only evil! behold, it is come.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The end is come, the end is come; it awaketh against thee: behold, it cometh.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The doom is come unto thee, inhabitant of the land; the time is come, the day is near,—tumult, and not the joyous cry from the mountains.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now will I soon pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger against thee; and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and will bring upon thee all thine abominations.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will render unto thee according to thy ways, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that it is I, Jehovah, that smite.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Behold the day, behold, it is come: the doom is gone forth; the rod hath blossomed, pride is full blown.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness: nothing of them [shall remain], nor of their multitude, nor of their wealth, nor of the magnificence in the midst of them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for fierce anger is upon all the multitude thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, even though he were yet alive amongst the living: for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof; it shall not be revoked; and none shall through his iniquity assure his life.</verse>
  <verse number="14">They have blown the trumpet and made all ready, but none goeth to the battle; for my fierce anger is upon all the multitude thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die by the sword; and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them moaning, every one for his iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="17">All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall melt into water.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And they shall gird on sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.</verse>
  <verse number="19">They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be as an impurity: their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of Jehovah’s wrath; they shall not satisfy their souls, neither fill their belly; for it hath been the stumbling-block of their iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he set in majesty his beautiful ornament; but they made therein the images of their abominations [and] of their detestable things: therefore have I made it an impurity unto them.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And I will give it into the hands of strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall profane it.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And I will turn my face from them; and they shall profane my secret [place]; and the violent shall enter into it, and profane it.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Make the chain; for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore will I bring the worst of the nations, and they shall possess their houses; and I will make the pride of the strong to cease; and their sanctuaries shall be profaned.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, but there shall be none.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; and they shall seek a vision from a prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the elders.</verse>
  <verse number="27">The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with dismay, and the hands of the people of the land shall tremble: I will do unto them according to their way, and with their judgments will I judge them; and they shall know that I [am] Jehovah.</verse>
