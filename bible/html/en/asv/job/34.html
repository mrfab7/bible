<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="34" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover Elihu answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear my words, ye wise men; And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the ear trieth words, As the palate tasteth food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Let us choose for us that which is right: Let us know among ourselves what is good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For Job hath said, I am righteous, And God hath taken away my right:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Notwithstanding my right I am accounted a liar; My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">What man is like Job, Who drinketh up scoffing like water,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, And walketh with wicked men?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing That he should delight himself with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the work of a man will he render unto him, And cause every man to find according to his ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly, Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who gave him a charge over the earth? Or who hath disposed the whole world?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If he set his heart upon himself, If he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All flesh shall perish together, And man shall turn again unto dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If now thou hast understanding, hear this: Hearken to the voice of my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Shall even one that hateth justice govern? And wilt thou condemn him that is righteous and mighty?â€”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Him that saith to a king, Thou art vile, Or to nobles, Ye are wicked;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">That respecteth not the persons of princes, Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor; For they all are the work of his hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In a moment they die, even at midnight; The people are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For his eyes are upon the ways of a man, And he seeth all his goings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For he needeth not further to consider a man, That he should go before God in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He breaketh in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out, And setteth others in their stead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Therefore he taketh knowledge of their works; And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He striketh them as wicked men In the open sight of others;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Because they turned aside from following him, And would not have regard in any of his ways:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">So that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him, And he heard the cry of the afflicted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">When he giveth quietness, who then can condemn? And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? Alike whether it be done unto a nation, or unto a man:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">That the godless man reign not, That there be none to ensnare the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For hath any said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">That which I see not teach thou me: If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Shall his recompense be as thou wilt, that thou refusest it? For thou must choose, and not I: Therefore speak what thou knowest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Men of understanding will say unto me, Yea, every wise man that heareth me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Job speaketh without knowledge, And his words are without wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Would that Job were tried unto the end, Because of his answering like wicked men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">For he addeth rebellion unto his sin; He clappeth his hands among us, And multiplieth his words against God.</p>
