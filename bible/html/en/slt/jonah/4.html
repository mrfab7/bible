<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And it will be evil to Jonah, a great evil, and it will kindle to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he will pray to Jehovah and say, Ah, now, O Jehovah, was not this my word while I was upon my land? For this I anticipated to flee to Tarshish, for I knew that thou art merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and of much kindness, and lamenting for evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And now, O Jehovah, take now my soul from me, for it is good for me to die rather than for me to live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Jehovah will say, Didst thou well for thee to be angry?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Jonah will go out of the city, and sit from the east to the city, and he make to him there a tent, and he will sit under it in the shadow, even till he shall see what will be upon the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Jehovah God will appoint a gourd, and it will come up from above to Jonah to be a shadow over his head to deliver to him from his evil. And Jonah will rejoice over the gourd with great joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And God will appoint a worm in the going up of the morning for the morrow, and it will strike the gourd, and it will dry up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And it will be as the sun rose, and God will appoint a sultry east wind; and the sun struck upon the head of Jonah, and he will faint, and he will ask his soul to die, and say, It is good for me to die rather than live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And God will say to Jonah, Was it well to kindle to thee for the gourd? And he will say, It was well to kindle to me, even to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Jehovah will say, Thou didst spare for the gourd, which thou didst not labor for it, and thou didst not cause it to grow; it was the youth of a night, and the son of a night perished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And shall I not spare for Nineveh the great city which there is in it more than one hundred and twenty thousand men which knew not between his right hand to his left, and many cattle?</p>
