<chapter book="Proverbs" number="5" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My son, attend to my wisdom, and bow your ear to my understanding:</verse>
  <verse number="2">That you may regard discretion, and that your lips may keep knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:</verse>
  <verse number="4">But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Lest you should ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that you can not know them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Hear me now therefore, O you children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Remove your way far from her, and come not near the door of her house:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Lest strangers be filled with your wealth; and your labors be in the house of a stranger;</verse>
  <verse number="11">And you mourn at the last, when your flesh and your body are consumed,</verse>
  <verse number="12">And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</verse>
  <verse number="13">And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined my ear to them that instructed me!</verse>
  <verse number="14">I was almost in all evil in the middle of the congregation and assembly.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Drink waters out of your own cistern, and running waters out of your own well.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Let your fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Let them be only your own, and not strangers’ with you.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Let your fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of your youth.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy you at all times; and be you ravished always with her love.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And why will you, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</verse>
  <verse number="21">For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his goings.</verse>
  <verse number="22">His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be held with the cords of his sins.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</verse>
