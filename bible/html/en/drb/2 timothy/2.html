<div class="chapter" data-book="2 Timothy" data-chapter="2" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace which is in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the things which thou hast heard of me by many witnesses, the same commend to faithful men, who shall be fit to teach others also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Labour as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">No man, being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular businesses; that he may please him to whom he hath engaged himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For he also that striveth for the mastery, is not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The husbandman, that laboureth, must first partake of the fruits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Understand what I say: for the Lord will give thee in all things understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Be mindful that the Lord Jesus Christ is risen again from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Wherein I labour even unto bands, as an evildoer; but the word of God is not bound.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation, which is in Christ Jesus, with heavenly glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">A faithful saying: for if we be dead with him, we shall live also with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If we suffer, we shall also reign with him. If we deny him, he will also deny us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If we believe not, he continueth faithful, he can not deny himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Of these things put them in mind, charging them before the Lord. Contend not in words, for it is to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Carefully study to present thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But shun profane and vain babblings: for they grow much towards ungodliness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And their speech spreadeth like a canker: of whom are Hymeneus and Philetus:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Who have erred from the truth, saying, that the resurrection is past already, and have subverted the faith of some.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But the sure foundation of God standeth firm, having this seal: the Lord knoweth who are his; and let every one depart from iniquity who nameth the name of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and earth: and some indeed unto honour, but some unto dishonour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">If any man therefore shall cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified and profitable to the Lord, prepared unto every good work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But flee thou youthful desires, and pursue justice, faith, charity, and peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And avoid foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they beget strifes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But the servant of the Lord must not wrangle: but be mild towards all men, apt to teach, patient,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">With modesty admonishing them that resist the truth: if peradventure God may give them repentance to know the truth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And they may recover themselves from the snares of the devil, by whom they are held captive at his will.</p>
