<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And immediately in the morning the chief priests, having taken counsel with the elders and scribes and the whole sanhedrim, bound Jesus and carried [him] away, and delivered [him] up to Pilate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered and said to him, Thou sayest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the chief priests accused him urgently.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? See of how many things they bear witness against thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marvelled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But at [the] feast he released to them one prisoner, whomsoever they begged [of him].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Now there was the [person] named Barabbas bound with those who had made insurrection with [him], [and] that had committed murder in the insurrection.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the crowd crying out began to beg [that he would do] to them as he had always done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But Pilate answered them saying, Will ye that I release to you the King of the Jews?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">for he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up through envy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But the chief priests stirred up the crowd that he might rather release Barabbas to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Pilate answering said to them again, What will ye then that I do [to him] whom ye call King of the Jews?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And they cried out again, Crucify him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Pilate said to them, What evil then has he done? But they cried out the more urgently, Crucify him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Pilate, desirous of contenting the crowd, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, that he might be crucified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the soldiers led him away into the court which is [called the] praetorium, and they call together the whole band.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And they clothe him with purple, and bind round on him a crown of thorns which they had plaited.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And they struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and, bending the knee, did him homage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And when they had mocked him, they took the purple off him, and put his own clothes on him; and they lead him out that they may crucify him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And they compel to go [with them] a certain passer-by, Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, the father of Alexander and Rufus, that he might carry his cross.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And they bring him to the place [called] Golgotha, which, being interpreted, is Place of a skull.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And they offered him wine [to drink] medicated with myrrh; but he did not take [it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And having crucified him, they part his clothes amongst [themselves], casting lots on them, what each one should take.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And the superscription of what he was accused of was written up: The King of the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And with him they crucify two robbers, one on his right hand, and one on his left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">[And the scripture was fulfilled which says, And he was reckoned with the lawless.]</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And they that passed by reviled him, shaking their heads, and saying, Aha, thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it in three days,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">save thyself, and descend from the cross.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">In like manner the chief priests also, with the scribes, mocking with one another, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Let the Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and may believe. And they that were crucified with him reproached him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And when [the] sixth hour was come, there came darkness over the whole land until [the] ninth hour;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">and at the ninth hour, Jesus cried with a loud voice, [saying], Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And some of those who stood by, when they heard [it], said, Behold, he calls for Elias.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And one, running and filling a sponge with vinegar, fixed it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone, let us see if Elias comes to take him down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And Jesus, having uttered a loud cry, expired.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And the centurion who stood by over against him, when he saw that he had expired having thus cried out, said, Truly this man was Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And there were women also looking on from afar off, among whom were both Mary of Magdala, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him and ministered to him; and many others who came up with him to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And when it was already evening, since it was [the] preparation, that is, [the day] before a sabbath,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable councillor, who also himself was awaiting the kingdom of God, coming, emboldened himself and went in to Pilate and begged the body of Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and having called to [him] the centurion, he inquired of him if he had long died.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">And when he knew from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">And having bought fine linen, [and] having taken him down, he swathed him in the fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was cut out of rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">And Mary of Magdala and Mary the [mother] of Joses saw where he was put.</p>
