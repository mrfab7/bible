<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And it will be as Zedekiah king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, and they will flee and go forth at night from the city the way of the king’s garden, in the gate between the two walls: and he will go forth the way of the desert.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the army of the Chaldeans will pursue after them, and they will overtake Zedekiah in the sterile region of Jericho, and they will take him and bring him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, to Riblah in the hand of Hamath, and he will speak with him judgments.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Go and say to the king’s servant the Cushite, saying, Thus said Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, Behold me bringing my words to this city for evil and not for good; and they were in that day before thee.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For escaping, I will let thee escape, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, and thy soul was to thee for booty: for thou didst trust in me, says Jehovah.</p>
