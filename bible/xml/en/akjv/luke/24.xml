  <verse number="1">Now on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</verse>
  <verse number="5">And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said to them, Why seek you the living among the dead?</verse>
  <verse number="6">He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke to you when he was yet in Galilee,</verse>
  <verse number="7">Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And they remembered his words,</verse>
  <verse number="9">And returned from the sepulcher, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.</verse>
  <verse number="10">It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things to the apostles.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Then arose Peter, and ran to the sepulcher; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about three score furlongs.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But their eyes were held that they should not know him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he said to them, What manner of communications are these that you have one to another, as you walk, and are sad?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said to him, Are you only a stranger in Jerusalem, and have not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?</verse>
  <verse number="19">And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</verse>
  <verse number="20">And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Yes, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulcher;</verse>
  <verse number="23">And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulcher, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then he said to them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</verse>
  <verse number="26">Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</verse>
  <verse number="27">And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And they drew near to the village, where they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</verse>
  <verse number="29">But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and broke, and gave to them.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</verse>
  <verse number="33">And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</verse>
  <verse number="34">Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And as they thus spoke, Jesus himself stood in the middle of them, and said to them, Peace be to you.</verse>
  <verse number="37">But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And he said to them, Why are you troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</verse>
  <verse number="39">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have you here any meat?</verse>
  <verse number="42">And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And he took it, and did eat before them.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</verse>
  <verse number="46">And said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</verse>
  <verse number="47">And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And you are witnesses of these things.</verse>
  <verse number="49">And, behold, I send the promise of my Father on you: but tarry you in the city of Jerusalem, until you be endued with power from on high.</verse>
  <verse number="50">And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</verse>
  <verse number="51">And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="52">And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</verse>
  <verse number="53">And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</verse>
