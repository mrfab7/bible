  <verse number="2">The LORD has also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:</verse>
  <verse number="4">Yes, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication to him: he found him in Bethel, and there he spoke with us;</verse>
  <verse number="5">Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD is his memorial.</verse>
