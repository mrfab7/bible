<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, And loving favour rather than silver and gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The rich and the poor meet together—The LORD is the maker of them all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A prudent man seeth the evil, and hideth himself; But the thoughtless pass on, and are punished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The reward of humility is the fear of the LORD, Even riches, and honour, and life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward; He that keepeth his soul holdeth himself far from them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Train up a child in the way he should go, And even when he is old, he will not depart from it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The rich ruleth over the poor, And the borrower is servant to the lender.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity; And the rod of his wrath shall fail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; For he giveth of his bread to the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Cast out the scorner, and contention will go out; Yea, strife and shame will cease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He that loveth pureness of heart, That hath grace in his lips, the king shall be his friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The eyes of the LORD preserve him that hath knowledge, But He overthroweth the words of the faithless man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The sluggard saith: ‘There is a lion without; I shall be slain in the streets.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: He that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child; But the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">One may oppress the poor, yet will their gain increase; One may give to the rich, yet will want come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Incline thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, And apply thy heart unto my knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; Let them be established altogether upon thy lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made them known to thee this day, even to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Have not I written unto thee excellent things Of counsels and knowledge;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth, That thou mightest bring back words of truth to them that send thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Rob not the weak, because he is weak, Neither crush the poor in the gate;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For the LORD will plead their cause, And despoil of life those that despoil them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Make no friendship with a man that is given to anger; And with a wrathful man thou shalt not go;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Lest thou learn his ways, And get a snare to thy soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Be thou not of them that strike hands, Or of them that are sureties for debts;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">If thou hast not wherewith to pay, Why should he take away thy bed from under thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Remove not the ancient landmark, Which thy fathers have set.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; He shall not stand before mean men.</p>
