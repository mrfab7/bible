<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The lifting up of the word of Jehovah in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus its gift: when to Jehovah the eye of man and all the tribes of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And also Hamath shall be the bound in it; Tyre and Zidon, for it was wise exceedingly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Tyre will build for herself a fortress, and she will heap up silver as the dust, and gold as the mud of the streets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Behold, Jehovah will dispossess her, and he struck her strength in the sea; and she shall be devoured by fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Ashkelon shall see and shall fear; and Gaza, and she shall be greatly pained, and Ekron; for her confidence was ashamed; and the king perished from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And a foreigner dwelt in Ashdod, and I cut off the pride of the rovers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I took away his bloods from his mouth, and his abominable things from between his teeth: and being left he also to our God, and he was a thousand in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And I encamped at my house a garrison from him passing by, and from him turning back: and he driving shall no more pass through against them: for now I saw with mine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; make a loud noise, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy king shall come to thee: just, and saving; he is humble and riding upon an ass, and upon an assâ€™s colt the son of asses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of war was cut off: and he spake peace to the nations: and his dominion from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the end of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Also thou by the blood of thy covenant I sent forth thy bound ones from the pit no water in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Turn back to the fortress, ye captives of hope: also announcing this day I will turn back double to thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For I tread out Judah to me, I filled the bow with Ephraim, and I raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and I set thee as the sword of the strong one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Jehovah will be seen upon them, and his arrow shall go forth as lightning: and the Lord Jehovah will strike upon the trumpet, and he went with tempests of the south.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Jehovah of armies shall protect over them; and they devoured and subdued with the stones of the sling; and they drank, they made a noise as from wine; and they filled as the vase, as the corners of the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Jehovah their God saved them in that day as the sheep of his people: for the stones of consecration, lifting themselves up in his land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For what his good, and what his beauty! Grain shall cause the young men to increase, and new wine the virgins.</p>
