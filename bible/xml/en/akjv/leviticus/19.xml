  <verse number="1">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Speak to all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say to them, You shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am holy.</verse>
  <verse number="3">You shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Turn you not to idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And if you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, you shall offer it at your own will.</verse>
  <verse number="6">It shall be eaten the same day you offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall not be accepted.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Therefore every one that eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And you shall not glean your vineyard, neither shall you gather every grape of your vineyard; you shall leave them for the poor and stranger: I am the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="11">You shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And you shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shall you profane the name of your God: I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="13">You shall not defraud your neighbor, neither rob him: the wages of him that is hired shall not abide with you all night until the morning.</verse>
  <verse number="14">You shall not curse the deaf, nor put a stumbling block before the blind, but shall fear your God: I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="15">You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: you shall not respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the mighty: but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor.</verse>
  <verse number="16">You shall not go up and down as a talebearer among your people: neither shall you stand against the blood of your neighbor; I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="17">You shall not hate your brother in your heart: you shall in any wise rebuke your neighbor, and not suffer sin on him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">You shall not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="19">You shall keep my statutes. You shall not let your cattle engender with a diverse kind: you shall not sow your field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woolen come on you.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And whoever lies carnally with a woman, that is a female slave, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he shall bring his trespass offering to the LORD, to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for a trespass offering.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he has done: and the sin which he has done shall be forgiven him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And when you shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then you shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised to you: it shall not be eaten of.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD with.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And in the fifth year shall you eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield to you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="26">You shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall you use enchantment, nor observe times.</verse>
  <verse number="27">You shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shall you mar the corners of your beard.</verse>
  <verse number="28">You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks on you: I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Do not prostitute your daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to prostitution, and the land become full of wickedness.</verse>
  <verse number="30">You shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="32">You shall rise up before the hoary head, and honor the face of the old man, and fear your God: I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And if a stranger sojourn with you in your land, you shall not vex him.</verse>
  <verse number="34">But the stranger that dwells with you shall be to you as one born among you, and you shall love him as yourself; for you were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="35">You shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in length, in weight, or in measure.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall you have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Therefore shall you observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.</verse>
