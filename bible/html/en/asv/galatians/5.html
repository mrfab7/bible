<div class="chapter" data-book="Galatians" data-chapter="5" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">For freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Behold, I Paul say unto you, that, if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Yea, I testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Ye are severed from Christ, ye who would be justified by the law; ye are fallen away from grace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Ye were running well; who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">This persuasion came not of him that calleth you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I have confidence to you-ward in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For ye, brethren, were called for freedom; only use not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through love be servants one to another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But I say, Walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other; that ye may not do the things that ye would.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousies, wraths, factions, divisions, parties,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">meekness, self-control; against such there is no law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And they that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.</p>
