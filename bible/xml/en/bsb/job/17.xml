<chapter book="Job" number="17" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">“My spirit is broken; my days are extinguished; the grave awaits me.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Surely mockers surround me, and my eyes must gaze at their rebellion.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Give me, I pray, the pledge You demand. Who else will be my guarantor?</verse>
  <verse number="4">You have closed their minds to understanding; therefore You will not exalt them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">If a man denounces his friends for a price, the eyes of his children will fail.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He has made me a byword among the people, a man in whose face they spit.</verse>
  <verse number="7">My eyes have grown dim with grief, and my whole body is but a shadow.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The upright are appalled at this, and the innocent are stirred against the godless.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Yet a righteous one holds to his way, and the one with clean hands grows stronger.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But come back and try again, all of you. For I will not find a wise man among you.</verse>
  <verse number="11">My days have passed; my plans are broken off—even the desires of my heart.</verse>
  <verse number="12">They have turned night into day, making light seem near in the face of darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If I look for Sheol as my home, if I spread out my bed in darkness,</verse>
  <verse number="14">and say to corruption, ‘You are my father,’ and to the worm, ‘My mother,’ or ‘My sister,’</verse>
  <verse number="15">where then is my hope? Who can see any hope for me?</verse>
  <verse number="16">Will it go down to the gates of Sheol? Will we go down together into the dust?”</verse>
