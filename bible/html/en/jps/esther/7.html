<p class="verse" data-verse="1">So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine: ‘Whatever thy petition, queen Esther, it shall be granted thee; and whatever thy request, even to the half of the kingdom, it shall be performed.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then Esther the queen answered and said: ‘If I have found favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">for we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and bondwomen, I had held my peace, for the adversary is not worthy that the king be endamaged.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then spoke the king Ahasuerus and said unto Esther the queen: ‘Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his heart to do so?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Esther said: ‘An adversary and an enemy, even this wicked Haman.’ Then Haman was terrified before the king and the queen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the king arose in his wrath from the banquet of wine and went into the palace garden; but Haman remained to make request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the couch whereon Esther was. Then said the king: ‘Will he even force the queen before me in the house?’ As the word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then said Harbonah, one of the chamberlains that were before the king: ‘Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman hath made for Mordecai, who spoke good for the king, standeth in the house of Haman.’ And the king said: ‘Hang him thereon.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then was the king’s wrath assuaged.</p>
