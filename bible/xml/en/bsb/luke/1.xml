<chapter book="Luke" number="1" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Many have undertaken to compose an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us,</verse>
  <verse number="2">just as they were handed down to us by the initial eyewitnesses and servants of the word.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Therefore, having carefully investigated everything from the beginning, it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
  <verse number="4">so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught.</verse>
  <verse number="5">In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah, and whose wife Elizabeth was a descendant of Aaron.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Both of them were righteous in the sight of God, walking blamelessly in all the commandments and decrees of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well along in years.</verse>
  <verse number="8">One day while Zechariah’s division was on duty and he was serving as priest before God,</verse>
  <verse number="9">he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter the temple of the Lord and burn incense.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And at the hour of the incense offering, the whole congregation was praying outside.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Just then an angel of the Lord appeared to Zechariah, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
  <verse number="12">When Zechariah saw him, he was startled and gripped with fear.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to give him the name John.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He will be a joy and delight to you, and many will rejoice at his birth,</verse>
  <verse number="15">for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He shall never take wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother’s womb.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Many of the sons of Israel he will turn back to the Lord their God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he will go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous—to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.”</verse>
  <verse number="18">“How can I be sure of this?” Zechariah asked the angel. “I am an old man, and my wife is well along in years.”</verse>
  <verse number="19">“I am Gabriel,” replied the angel. “I stand in the presence of God, and I have been sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And now you will be silent and unable to speak until the day this comes to pass, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled at their proper time.”</verse>
  <verse number="21">Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he took so long in the temple.</verse>
  <verse number="22">When he came out and was unable to speak to them, they realized he had seen a vision in the temple. He kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And when the days of his service were complete, he returned home.</verse>
  <verse number="24">After these days, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion. She declared,</verse>
  <verse number="25">“The Lord has done this for me. In these days He has shown me favor and taken away my disgrace among the people.”</verse>
  <verse number="26">In the sixth month, God sent the angel Gabriel to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,</verse>
  <verse number="27">to a virgin pledged in marriage to a man named Joseph, who was of the house of David. And the virgin’s name was Mary.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The angel appeared to her and said, “Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.”</verse>
  <verse number="29">Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.</verse>
  <verse number="30">So the angel told her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Behold, you will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to give Him the name Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="32">He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David,</verse>
  <verse number="33">and He will reign over the house of Jacob forever. His kingdom will never end!”</verse>
  <verse number="34">“How can this be,” Mary asked the angel, “since I am a virgin?”</verse>
  <verse number="35">The angel replied, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Look, even Elizabeth your relative has conceived a son in her old age, and she who was called barren is in her sixth month.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For no word from God will ever fail.”</verse>
  <verse number="38">“I am the Lord’s servant,” Mary answered. “May it happen to me according to your word.” Then the angel left her.</verse>
  <verse number="39">In those days Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judah,</verse>
  <verse number="40">where she entered the home of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
  <verse number="41">When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="42">In a loud voice she exclaimed, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!</verse>
  <verse number="43">And why am I so honored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
  <verse number="44">For as soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord’s word to her will be fulfilled.”</verse>
  <verse number="46">Then Mary said: “My soul magnifies the Lord,</verse>
  <verse number="47">and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior!</verse>
  <verse number="48">For He has looked with favor on the humble state of His servant. From now on all generations will call me blessed.</verse>
  <verse number="49">For the Mighty One has done great things for me. Holy is His name.</verse>
  <verse number="50">His mercy extends to those who fear Him, from generation to generation.</verse>
  <verse number="51">He has performed mighty deeds with His arm; He has scattered those who are proud in the thoughts of their hearts.</verse>
  <verse number="52">He has brought down rulers from their thrones, but has exalted the humble.</verse>
  <verse number="53">He has filled the hungry with good things, but has sent the rich away empty.</verse>
  <verse number="54">He has helped His servant Israel, remembering to be merciful,</verse>
  <verse number="55">as He promised to our fathers, to Abraham and his descendants forever.”</verse>
  <verse number="56">Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.</verse>
  <verse number="57">When the time came for Elizabeth to have her child, she gave birth to a son.</verse>
  <verse number="58">Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her great mercy, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
  <verse number="59">On the eighth day, when they came to circumcise the child, they were going to name him after his father Zechariah.</verse>
  <verse number="60">But his mother replied, “No! He shall be called John.”</verse>
  <verse number="61">They said to her, “There is no one among your relatives who bears this name.”</verse>
  <verse number="62">So they made signs to his father to find out what he wanted to name the child.</verse>
  <verse number="63">Zechariah asked for a tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And they were all amazed.</verse>
  <verse number="64">Immediately Zechariah’s mouth was opened and his tongue was released, and he began to speak, praising God.</verse>
  <verse number="65">All their neighbors were filled with awe, and people throughout the hill country of Judea were talking about these events.</verse>
  <verse number="66">And all who heard this wondered in their hearts and asked, “What then will this child become?” For the Lord’s hand was with him.</verse>
  <verse number="67">Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:</verse>
  <verse number="68">“Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because He has visited and redeemed His people.</verse>
  <verse number="69">He has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David,</verse>
  <verse number="70">as He spoke through His holy prophets, those of ages past,</verse>
  <verse number="71">salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,</verse>
  <verse number="72">to show mercy to our fathers and to remember His holy covenant,</verse>
  <verse number="73">the oath He swore to our father Abraham, to grant us</verse>
  <verse number="74">deliverance from hostile hands, that we may serve Him without fear,</verse>
  <verse number="75">in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our lives.</verse>
  <verse number="76">And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High; for you will go on before the Lord to prepare the way for Him,</verse>
  <verse number="77">to give to His people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins,</verse>
  <verse number="78">because of the tender mercy of our God, by which the Dawn will visit us from on high,</verse>
  <verse number="79">to shine on those who live in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the path of peace.”</verse>
  <verse number="80">And the child grew and became strong in spirit; and he lived in the wilderness until the time of his public appearance to Israel.</verse>
