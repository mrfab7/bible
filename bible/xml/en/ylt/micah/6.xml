  <verse number="1">Hear, I pray you, that which Jehovah is saying: ‘Rise—strive thou with the mountains, And cause thou the hills to hear thy voice.’</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hear, O mountains, the strife of Jehovah, Ye strong ones—foundations of earth! For a strife is to Jehovah, with His people, And with Israel He doth reason.</verse>
  <verse number="3">O My people, what have I done to thee? And what—have I wearied thee? Testify against Me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For I brought thee up from the land of Egypt, And from the house of servants I have ransomed thee, And I send before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</verse>
  <verse number="5">O My people, remember, I pray you, What counsel did Balak king of Moab, What answer him did Balaam son of Beor, (From Shittim unto Gilgal,) In order to know the righteous acts of Jehovah.’</verse>
  <verse number="6">With what do I come before Jehovah? Do I bow to God Most High? Do I come before Him with burnt-offerings? With calves—sons of a year?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Is Jehovah pleased with thousands of rams? With myriads of streams of oil? Do I give my first-born for my transgression? The fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</verse>
  <verse number="8">He hath declared to thee, O man, what is good; Yea, what is Jehovah requiring of thee, Except—to do judgment, and love kindness, And lowly to walk with thy God?</verse>
  <verse number="9">A voice of Jehovah to the city calleth, And wisdom doth fear Thy name, Hear ye the rod, and Him who appointed it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Are there yet in the house of the wicked Treasures of wickedness, And the abhorred scanty ephah?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Do I reckon it pure with balances of wickedness? And with a bag of deceitful stones?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Whose rich ones have been full of violence, And its inhabitants have spoken falsehood, And their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And I also, I have begun to smite thee, To make desolate, because of thy sins.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thou—thou eatest, and thou art not satisfied, And thy pit is in thy midst, And thou removest, and dost not deliver, And that which thou deliverest, to a sword I give.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thou—thou sowest, and thou dost not reap, Thou—thou treadest the olive, And thou pourest not out oil, And new wine—and thou drinkest not wine.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And kept habitually are the statutes of Omri, And all the work of the house of Ahab, And ye do walk in their counsels, For My giving thee for a desolation, And its inhabitants for a hissing, And the reproach of My people ye do bear!</verse>
