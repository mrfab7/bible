<chapter book="Job" number="33" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Why, Job, I pray you, hear my speeches, and listen to all my words.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue has spoken in my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty has given me life.</verse>
  <verse number="5">If you can answer me, set your words in order before me, stand up.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Behold, I am according to your wish in God’s stead: I also am formed out of the clay.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Behold, my terror shall not make you afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy on you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Surely you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of your words, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="9">I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Behold, he finds occasions against me, he counts me for his enemy,</verse>
  <verse number="11">He puts my feet in the stocks, he marks all my paths.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Behold, in this you are not just: I will answer you, that God is greater than man.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Why do you strive against him? for he gives not account of any of his matters.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For God speaks once, yes twice, yet man perceives it not.</verse>
  <verse number="15">In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, in slumberings on the bed;</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then he opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction,</verse>
  <verse number="17">That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He keeps back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He is chastened also with pain on his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:</verse>
  <verse number="20">So that his life abhors bread, and his soul dainty meat.</verse>
  <verse number="21">His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Yes, his soul draws near to the grave, and his life to the destroyers.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man his uprightness:</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then he is gracious to him, and said, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.</verse>
  <verse number="25">His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth:</verse>
  <verse number="26">He shall pray to God, and he will be favorable to him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render to man his righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="27">He looks on men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;</verse>
  <verse number="28">He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</verse>
  <verse number="29">See, all these things works God oftentimes with man,</verse>
  <verse number="30">To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Mark well, O Job, listen to me: hold your peace, and I will speak.</verse>
  <verse number="32">If you have anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify you.</verse>
  <verse number="33">If not, listen to me: hold your peace, and I shall teach you wisdom.</verse>
