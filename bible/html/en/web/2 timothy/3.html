<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But know this, that in the last days, grievous times will come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">without natural affection, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, fierce, no lovers of good,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">traitors, headstrong, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">holding a form of godliness, but having denied its power. Turn away from these, also.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For some of these are people who creep into houses, and take captive gullible women loaded down with sins, led away by various lusts,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Even as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so do these also oppose the truth; men corrupted in mind, who concerning the faith, are rejected.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But they will proceed no further. For their folly will be evident to all men, as theirs also came to be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But you did follow my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, steadfastness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">persecutions, and sufferings: those things that happened to me at Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I endured those persecutions. Out of them all the Lord delivered me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But you remain in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">From infancy, you have known the holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith, which is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Every Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.</p>
