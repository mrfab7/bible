<chapter book="Song of Solomon" number="7" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">How beautiful are your sandaled feet, O daughter of the prince! The curves of your thighs are like jewels, the handiwork of a master.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Your navel is a rounded goblet; it never lacks blended wine. Your waist is a mound of wheat encircled by the lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Your neck is like a tower made of ivory; your eyes are like the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim; your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, facing toward Damascus.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel, the hair of your head like purple threads; the king is captured in your tresses.</verse>
  <verse number="6">How fair and pleasant you are, O love, with your delights!</verse>
  <verse number="7">Your stature is like a palm tree; your breasts are clusters of fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I said, “I will climb the palm tree; I will take hold of its fruit.” May your breasts be like clusters of the vine, the fragrance of your breath like apples,</verse>
  <verse number="9">and your mouth like the finest wine. May it flow smoothly to my beloved, gliding gently over lips and teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I belong to my beloved, and his desire is for me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Come, my beloved, let us go to the countryside; let us spend the night among the wildflowers.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Let us go early to the vineyards to see if the vine has budded, if the blossom has opened, if the pomegranates are in bloom—there I will give you my love.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The mandrakes send forth a fragrance, and at our door is every delicacy, new as well as old, that I have treasured up for you, my beloved.</verse>
