1	And in that day thou shalt say: ‘I will give thanks unto Thee, O LORD; For though Thou was angry with me, Thine anger is turned away, and Thou comfortest me.
2	Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and will not be afraid; For GOD the LORD is my strength and song; And He is become my salvation.’
3	Therefore with joy shall ye draw water Out of the wells of salvation.
4	And in that day shall ye say: ‘Give thanks unto the LORD, proclaim His name, Declare His doings among the peoples, Make mention that His name is exalted.
5	Sing unto the LORD; for He hath done gloriously; This is made known in all the earth.
6	Cry aloud and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion, For great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.’
