<p class="verse" data-verse="1">[This] then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families; [even] to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin southward [was] the uttermost part of the south coast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from the bay that looketh southward:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to Karkaa:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">[From thence] it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall be your south coast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the east border [was] the salt sea, [even] unto the end of Jordan. And [their] border in the north quarter [was] from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor, and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that [is] before the going up to Adummim, which [is] on the south side of the river: and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at Enrogel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the south side of the Jebusite; the same [is] Jerusalem: and the border went up to the top of the mountain that [lieth] before the valley of Hinnom westward, which [is] at the end of the valley of the giants northward:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which [is] Kirjathjearim:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir, and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which [is] Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to Timnah:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the west border [was] to the great sea, and the coast [thereof]. This [is] the coast of the children of Judah round about according to their families.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua, [even] the city of Arba the father of Anak, which [city is] Hebron.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir before [was] Kirjathsepher.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And it came to pass, as she came [unto him], that she moved him to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off [her] ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs, and the nether springs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">This [is] the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.</p>
