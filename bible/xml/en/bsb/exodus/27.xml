  <verse number="1">“You are to build an altar of acacia wood. The altar must be square, five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Make a horn on each of its four corners, so that the horns are of one piece, and overlay it with bronze.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Make all its utensils of bronze—its pots for removing ashes, its shovels, its sprinkling bowls, its meat forks, and its firepans.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Construct for it a grate of bronze mesh, and make a bronze ring at each of the four corners of the mesh.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Set the grate beneath the ledge of the altar, so that the mesh comes halfway up the altar.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Additionally, make poles of acacia wood for the altar and overlay them with bronze.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The poles are to be inserted into the rings so that the poles are on two sides of the altar when it is carried.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Construct the altar with boards so that it is hollow. It is to be made just as you were shown on the mountain.</verse>
  <verse number="9">You are also to make a courtyard for the tabernacle. On the south side of the courtyard make curtains of finely spun linen, a hundred cubits long on one side,</verse>
  <verse number="10">with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, and silver hooks and bands on the posts.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Likewise there are to be curtains on the north side, a hundred cubits long, with twenty posts and twenty bronze bases, and with silver hooks and bands on the posts.</verse>

  <verse number="15">and the curtains on the other side fifteen cubits long, with three posts and three bases.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The gate of the courtyard shall be twenty cubits long, with a curtain embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely spun linen. It shall have four posts and four bases.</verse>
  <verse number="17">All the posts around the courtyard shall have silver bands, silver hooks, and bronze bases.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The entire courtyard shall be a hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide, with curtains of finely spun linen five cubits high, and with bronze bases.</verse>
  <verse number="19">All the utensils of the tabernacle for every use, including all its tent pegs and the tent pegs of the courtyard, shall be made of bronze.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And you are to command the Israelites to bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to keep the lamps burning continually.</verse>
  <verse number="21">In the Tent of Meeting, outside the veil that is in front of the Testimony, Aaron and his sons are to tend the lamps before the LORD from evening until morning. This is to be a permanent statute for the Israelites for the generations to come.</verse>
