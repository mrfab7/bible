<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover Jehovah answered Job, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Shall he that cavilleth contend with the Almighty? He that argueth with God, let him answer it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then Job answered Jehovah, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Behold, I am of small account; What shall I answer thee? I lay my hand upon my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Once have I spoken, and I will not answer; Yea, twice, but I will proceed no further.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then Jehovah answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Wilt thou even annul my judgment? Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be justified?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Or hast thou an arm like God? And canst thou thunder with a voice like him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Deck thyself now with excellency and dignity; And array thyself with honor and majesty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Pour forth the overflowings of thine anger; And look upon every one that is proud, and abase him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; And tread down the wicked where they stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hide them in the dust together; Bind their faces in the hidden place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then will I also confess of thee That thine own right hand can save thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold now, behemoth, which I made as well as thee; He eateth grass as an ox.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Lo now, his strength is in his loins, And his force is in the muscles of his belly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He moveth his tail like a cedar: The sinews of his thighs are knit together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">His bones are as tubes of brass; His limbs are like bars of iron.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He is the chief of the ways of God: He only that made him giveth him his sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Surely the mountains bring him forth food, Where all the beasts of the field do play.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He lieth under the lotus-trees, In the covert of the reed, and the fen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The lotus-trees cover him with their shade; The willows of the brook compass him about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not; He is confident, though a Jordan swell even to his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Shall any take him when he is on the watch, Or pierce through his nose with a snare?</p>
