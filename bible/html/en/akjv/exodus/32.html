<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron, and said to him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Aaron said to them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And all the people broke off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them to Aaron.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a engraving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the LORD said to Moses, Go, get you down; for your people, which you brought out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be your gods, O Israel, which have brought you up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the LORD said to Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff necked people:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of you a great nation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Moses sought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why does your wrath wax hot against your people, which you have brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Why should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from your fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against your people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give to your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do to his people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Moses turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven on the tables.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And it came to pass, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses’ anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and broke them beneath the mount.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it on the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people to you, that you have brought so great a sin on them?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: you know the people, that they are set on mischief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For they said to me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And I said to them, Whoever has any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And when Moses saw that the people were naked; (for Aaron had made them naked to their shame among their enemies:)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD’s side? let him come to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves together to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And he said to them, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man on his son, and on his brother; that he may bestow on you a blessing this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said to the people, You have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up to the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Yet now, if you will forgive their sin—; and if not, blot me, I pray you, out of your book which you have written.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And the LORD said to Moses, Whoever has sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Therefore now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to you: behold, my Angel shall go before you: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin on them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which Aaron made.</p>
