  <verse number="1">Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the people of the east.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, see, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they watered the flocks: and a great stone was on the well’s mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone again on the well’s mouth in his place.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Jacob said to them, My brothers, from where be you? And they said, Of Haran are we.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he said to them, Know you Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he said to them, Is he well? And they said, He is well: and, behold, Rachel his daughter comes with the sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he said, See, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together: water you the sheep, and go and feed them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered together, and till they roll the stone from the well’s mouth; then we water the sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And while he yet spoke with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep; for she kept them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and that he was Rebekah’s son: and she ran and told her father.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh. And he stayed with him the space of a month.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Laban said to Jacob, Because you are my brother, should you therefore serve me for nothing? tell me, what shall your wages be?</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favored.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Laban said, It is better that I give her to you, than that I should give her to another man: abide with me.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed to him but a few days, for the love he had to her.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in to her.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Laban gave to his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an handmaid.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah: and he said to Laban, What is this you have done to me? did not I serve with you for Rachel? why then have you beguiled me?</verse>
  <verse number="26">And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give the younger before the firstborn.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Fulfill her week, and we will give you this also for the service which you shall serve with me yet seven other years.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be her maid.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And he went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb: but Rachel was barren.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD has looked on my affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Because the LORD has heard I was hated, he has therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined to me, because I have born him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And she conceived again, and bore a son: and she said, Now will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left bearing.</verse>
