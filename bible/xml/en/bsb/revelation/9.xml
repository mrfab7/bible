<chapter book="Revelation" number="9" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Then the fifth angel sounded his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to earth, and it was given the key to the pit of the Abyss.</verse>
  <verse number="2">The star opened the pit of the Abyss, and smoke rose out of it like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke from the pit.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And out of the smoke, locusts descended on the earth, and they were given power like that of the scorpions of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree, but only those who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The locusts were not given power to kill them, but only to torment them for five months, and their torment was like the stinging of a scorpion.</verse>
  <verse number="6">In those days men will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, but death will escape them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the locusts looked like horses prepared for battle, with something like crowns of gold on their heads; and their faces were like the faces of men.</verse>
  <verse number="8">They had hair like that of women, and teeth like those of lions.</verse>
  <verse number="9">They also had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings was like the roar of many horses and chariots rushing into battle.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They had tails with stingers like scorpions, which had the power to injure people for five months.</verse>
  <verse number="11">They were ruled by a king, the angel of the Abyss. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek it is Apollyon.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The first woe has passed. Behold, two woes are still to follow.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then the sixth angel sounded his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God</verse>
  <verse number="14">saying to the sixth angel with the trumpet, “Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">So the four angels who had been prepared for this hour and day and month and year were released to kill a third of mankind.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the number of mounted troops was two hundred million; I heard their number.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Now the horses and riders in my vision looked like this: The riders had breastplates the colors of fire, sapphire, and sulfur. The heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and out of their mouths proceeded fire, smoke, and sulfur.</verse>
  <verse number="18">A third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire, smoke, and sulfur that proceeded from their mouths.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For the power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails; indeed, their tails were like snakes, having heads with which to inflict harm.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Now the rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues still did not repent of the works of their hands. They did not stop worshiping demons and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Furthermore, they did not repent of their murder, sorcery, sexual immorality, and theft.</verse>
