<chapter book="Matthew" number="27" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And morning having come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus, so as to put him to death;</verse>
  <verse number="2">and having bound him, they did lead away, and delivered him up to Pontius Pilate, the governor.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then Judas—he who delivered him up—having seen that he was condemned, having repented, brought back the thirty silverlings to the chief priests, and to the elders, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="4">‘I did sin, having delivered up innocent blood;’ and they said, ‘What—to us? thou shalt see!’</verse>
  <verse number="5">and having cast down the silverlings in the sanctuary, he departed, and having gone away, he did strangle himself.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the chief priests having taken the silverlings, said, ‘It is not lawful to put them to the treasury, seeing it is the price of blood;’</verse>
  <verse number="7">and having taken counsel, they bought with them the field of the potter, for the burial of strangers;</verse>
  <verse number="8">therefore was that field called, ‘Field of blood,’ unto this day.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then was fulfilled that spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, ‘And I took the thirty silverlings, the price of him who hath been priced, whom they of the sons of Israel did price,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and gave them for the field of the potter, as the Lord did appoint to me.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor did question him, saying, ‘Art thou the king of the Jews!’ And Jesus said to him, ‘Thou sayest.’</verse>
  <verse number="12">And in his being accused by the chief priests and the elders, he did not answer any thing,</verse>
  <verse number="13">then saith Pilate to him, ‘Dost thou not hear how many things they witness against thee?’</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he did not answer him, not even to one word, so that the governor did wonder greatly.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And at the feast the governor had been accustomed to release one to the multitude, a prisoner, whom they willed,</verse>
  <verse number="16">and they had then a noted prisoner, called Barabbas,</verse>
  <verse number="17">they therefore having been gathered together, Pilate said to them, ‘Whom will ye I shall release to you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?’</verse>
  <verse number="18">for he had known that because of envy they had delivered him up.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And as he is sitting on the tribunal, his wife sent unto him, saying, ‘Nothing—to thee and to that righteous one, for many things did I suffer to-day in a dream because of him.’</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the chief priests and the elders did persuade the multitudes that they might ask for themselves Barabbas, and might destroy Jesus;</verse>
  <verse number="21">and the governor answering said to them, ‘Which of the two will ye that I shall release to you?’ And they said, ‘Barabbas.’</verse>
  <verse number="22">Pilate saith to them, ‘What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?’ They all say to him, ‘Let be crucified!’</verse>
  <verse number="23">And the governor said, ‘Why, what evil did he?’ and they were crying out the more, saying, ‘Let be crucified.’</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Pilate having seen that it profiteth nothing, but rather a tumult is made, having taken water, he did wash the hands before the multitude, saying, ‘I am innocent from the blood of this righteous one; ye—ye shall see;’</verse>
  <verse number="25">and all the people answering said, ‘His blood is upon us, and upon our children!’</verse>
  <verse number="26">Then did he release to them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him up that he may be crucified;</verse>
  <verse number="27">then the soldiers of the governor having taken Jesus to the Praetorium, did gather to him all the band;</verse>
  <verse number="28">and having unclothed him, they put around him a crimson cloak,</verse>
  <verse number="29">and having plaited him a crown out of thorns they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand, and having kneeled before him, they were mocking him, saying, ‘Hail, the king of the Jews.’</verse>
  <verse number="30">And having spit on him, they took the reed, and were smiting on his head;</verse>
  <verse number="31">and when they had mocked him, they took off from him the cloak, and put on him his own garments, and led him away to crucify him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And coming forth, they found a man, a Cyrenian, by name Simon: him they impressed that he might bear his cross;</verse>
  <verse number="33">and having come to a place called Golgotha, that is called Place of a Skull,</verse>
  <verse number="34">they gave him to drink vinegar mixed with gall, and having tasted, he would not drink.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And having crucified him, they divided his garments, casting a lot, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by the prophet, ‘They divided my garments to themselves, and over my vesture they cast a lot;’</verse>
  <verse number="36">and sitting down, they were watching him there,</verse>
  <verse number="37">and they put up over his head, his accusation written, ‘This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.’</verse>
  <verse number="38">Then crucified with him are two robbers, one on the right hand, and one on the left,</verse>
  <verse number="39">and those passing by were speaking evil of him, wagging their heads,</verse>
  <verse number="40">and saying, ‘Thou that art throwing down the sanctuary, and in three days building it, save thyself; if Son thou art of God, come down from the cross.’</verse>
  <verse number="41">And in like manner also the chief priests mocking, with the scribes and elders, said,</verse>
  <verse number="42">‘Others he saved; himself he is not able to save! If he be King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe him;</verse>
  <verse number="43">he hath trusted on God, let Him now deliver him, if He wish him, because he said—Son of God I am;’</verse>
  <verse number="44">with the same also the robbers, who were crucified with him, were reproaching him.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And from the sixth hour darkness came over all the land unto the ninth hour,</verse>
  <verse number="46">and about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a great voice, saying, ‘Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?’ that is, ‘My God, my God, why didst Thou forsake me?’</verse>
  <verse number="47">And certain of those standing there having heard, said—‘Elijah he doth call;’</verse>
  <verse number="48">and immediately, one of them having run, and having taken a spunge, having filled it with vinegar, and having put it on a reed, was giving him to drink,</verse>
  <verse number="49">but the rest said, ‘Let alone, let us see if Elijah doth come—about to save him.’</verse>
  <verse number="50">And Jesus having again cried with a great voice, yielded the spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="51">and lo, the vail of the sanctuary was rent in two from top unto bottom, and the earth did quake, and the rocks were rent,</verse>
  <verse number="52">and the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who have fallen asleep, arose,</verse>
  <verse number="53">and having come forth out of the tombs after his rising, they went into the holy city, and appeared to many.</verse>
  <verse number="54">And the centurion, and those with him watching Jesus, having seen the earthquake, and the things that were done, were exceedingly afraid, saying, ‘Truly this was God’s Son.’</verse>
  <verse number="55">And there were there many women beholding from afar, who did follow Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him,</verse>
  <verse number="56">among whom was Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and of Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</verse>
  <verse number="57">And evening having come, there came a rich man, from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was discipled to Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="58">he having gone near to Pilate, asked for himself the body of Jesus; then Pilate commanded the body to be given back.</verse>
  <verse number="59">And having taken the body, Joseph wrapped it in clean linen,</verse>
  <verse number="60">and laid it in his new tomb, that he hewed in the rock, and having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, he went away;</verse>
  <verse number="61">and there were there Mary the Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over-against the sepulchre.</verse>
  <verse number="62">And on the morrow that is after the preparation, were gathered together the chief priests, and the Pharisees, unto Pilate,</verse>
  <verse number="63">saying, ‘Sir, we have remembered that that deceiver said while yet living, After three days I do rise;</verse>
  <verse number="64">command, then, the sepulchre to be made secure till the third day, lest his disciples, having come by night, may steal him away, and may say to the people, He rose from the dead, and the last deceit shall be worse than the first.’</verse>
  <verse number="65">And Pilate said to them, ‘Ye have a watch, go away, make secure—as ye have known;’</verse>
  <verse number="66">and they, having gone, did make the sepulchre secure, having sealed the stone, together with the watch.</verse>
