<chapter book="Ecclesiastes" number="3" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</verse>
  <verse number="2">A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</verse>
  <verse number="3">A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</verse>
  <verse number="4">A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</verse>
  <verse number="5">A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</verse>
  <verse number="6">A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</verse>
  <verse number="7">A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</verse>
  <verse number="8">A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</verse>
  <verse number="9">What profit has he that works in that wherein he labors?</verse>
  <verse number="10">I have seen the travail, which God has given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He has made every thing beautiful in his time: also he has set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God makes from the beginning to the end.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labor, it is the gift of God.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I know that, whatever God does, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God does it, that men should fear before him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">That which has been is now; and that which is to be has already been; and God requires that which is past.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I said in my heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I said in my heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For that which befalls the sons of men befalls beasts; even one thing befalls them: as the one dies, so dies the other; yes, they have all one breath; so that a man has no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="20">All go to one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Who knows the spirit of man that goes upward, and the spirit of the beast that goes downward to the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="22">Why I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</verse>
