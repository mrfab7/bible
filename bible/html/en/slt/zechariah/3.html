<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And he will cause me to see Joshua the great priest standing before the messenger of Jehovah, and the adversary standing upon his right hand for his adversary.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Jehovah will say to the adversary, And Jehovah will rebuke in thee, thou adversary: and Jehovah having chosen in Jerusalem will rebuke in thee: is not this a fire-brand snatched from the fire?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Joshua was clothed in filthy garments, and he stood before the messenger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he will answer and say to them standing before him, saying, Remove the filthy garments from off him, And he will say to him, See, I caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and clothed thee with festive garments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And saying, They shall set a pure turban upon his head; and they will set the pure turban upon his head, and they will put on the garments. And the messenger of Jehovah stood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the messenger of Jehovah will protest to Joshua, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thus said Jehovah of armies: If thou wilt go in my way, and if thou shalt watch my watches, and thou also shalt judge my house, and also thou shalt watch my enclosure, and I gave to thee the goings between these standing by.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Hear now, O Joshua the great priest, thou and thy friends sitting before thee, for they are men of wonder: for behold me bringing my servant the Sprout.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For behold the stone which I gave before Joshua; upon one stone seven eyes: behold me engraving its engraving, says Jehovah of armies, and I removed the iniquity of that land in one day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">In that day, says Jehovah of armies, ye shall call each his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.</p>
