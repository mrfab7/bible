<chapter book="Song of Solomon" number="7" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">As the chorus of ‘Mahanaim.’ How beautiful were thy feet with sandals, O daughter of Nadib. The turnings of thy sides are as ornaments, Work of the hands of an artificer.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thy waist is a basin of roundness, It lacketh not the mixture, Thy body a heap of wheat, fenced with lilies,</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thy two breasts as two young ones, twins of a roe,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thy neck as a tower of the ivory, Thine eyes pools in Heshbon, near the gate of Bath-Rabbim, Thy face as a tower of Lebanon looking to Damascus,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thy head upon thee as Carmel, And the locks of thy head as purple, The king is bound with the flowings!</verse>
  <verse number="6">How fair and how pleasant hast thou been, O love, in delights.</verse>
  <verse number="7">This thy stature hath been like to a palm, And thy breasts to clusters.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I said, ‘Let me go up on the palm, Let me lay hold on its boughs, Yea, let thy breasts be, I pray thee, as clusters of the vine, And the fragrance of thy face as citrons,</verse>
  <verse number="9">And thy palate as the good wine—‘Flowing to my beloved in uprightness, Strengthening the lips of the aged!</verse>
  <verse number="10">I am my beloved’s, and on me is his desire.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Come, my beloved, we go forth to the field,</verse>
  <verse number="12">We lodge in the villages, we go early to the vineyards, We see if the vine hath flourished, The sweet smelling-flower hath opened. The pomegranates have blossomed, There do I give to thee my loves;</verse>
  <verse number="13">The mandrakes have given fragrance, And at our openings all pleasant things, New, yea, old, my beloved, I laid up for thee!</verse>
