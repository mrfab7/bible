1	And Jehovah will answer Job, and he will say,
2	Shall he contending with the Almighty, instruct? he reproving God shall answer it.
3	And Job will answer Jehovah, and say,
4	Behold, I was vile; what shall I turn back to thee? I put my hand to my mouth.
5	Once I sake, and I will not answer: and twice, and I will not add.
6	And Jehovah will answer Job from the whirlwind, and he will say,
7	Gird up now thy loins as a man; I will ask thee, and do thou make known to me.
8	Wilt thou also annul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me so that thou shalt be just?
9	And if an arm to thee as God? and with thy voice wilt thou thunder as he?
10	Deck thyself now with majesty and grandeur, and thou shalt put on ornament and splendor.
11	Scatter the overflowings of thine anger, and see every proud one and bring him low.
12	See every proud one, and humble him; and crush the unjust in their place.
13	Hide them in the dust together, and bind their faces in hiding.
14	And also I will confess to thee that thy right hand shall save for thee.
15	Behold now, the great beast which I made with thee; he will eat grass as an ox.
16	Behold now, his strength in his loins, and his power in the sinews of his belly.
17	He will bend his tail as a cedar; the sinews of his thighs will be woven together.
18	His bones tubes of brass; his bones as a hammered bar of iron.
19	He the chief of the ways of God: he making him, his sword will reach.
20	For the mountains shall lift up produce for him, and all the beasts of the field shall play there.
21	He will lie down under the shades, in the covering of the reed and marsh.
22	The shades shall cover him with their shadow; the willows of the torrent shall surround him.
23	Behold, he will oppress a river, and he will not spring up: he will trust that Jordan burst forth into his mouth.
24	He will take it with his eyes: his nose will pierce through snares.
