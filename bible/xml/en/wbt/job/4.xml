  <verse number="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">If we essay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can refrain from speaking?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thy words have upheld him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But now it hath come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off;</verse>
  <verse number="8">Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</verse>
  <verse number="9">By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and my ear received a small sound of it.</verse>
  <verse number="13">In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</verse>
  <verse number="16">It stood still, but I could not discern its form: an image was before my eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="17">Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</verse>
  <verse number="19">How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth?</verse>
  <verse number="20">They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Doth not their excellence which is in them depart? they die, even without wisdom.</verse>
