<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Israel an empty vine, he will place fruit to himself: according to the multitude to his fruit he multiplied to his altars; according to the goodness of his land they made good pillars.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Their heart was divided; now shall they be guilty: he will break down their altars, he shall lay waste their images.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For now they will say, No king to us because we feared not Jehovah; and what shall the king do to us?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They spake words swearing falsehood, cutting out a covenant: and judgment broke forth as the head upon the furrows of the field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For the calves of the house of vanity they shall fear dwelling in Shomeron: for his people mourned over it, and his priests will exult over it, for its glory, for it was removed from it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Also it shall be brought to Assur a gift to king Jareb: Ephraim shall take shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his counsel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Shomeron, her king was cut off as chiefs upon the face of the waters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the heights of vanity were destroyed, the sin of Israel: the thorn and weeds shall come up upon their altars; and they said to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall upon us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">From the days of the hill thou didst sin, O Israel: there they stood: the battle in the hill against the sons of iniquity shall not overtake them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">In my coming and I shall correct them, and the peoples shall be gathered together against them in their being bound to their two sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Ephraim a heifer being taught, loving to tread out the grain, and I passed over upon the good of her neck: I will cause Ephraim to ride; Judah shall be silent, and Jacob shall be strong to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Sow to yourselves for justice, reap ye for the mouth of kindness; break up to you the fallow ground: and the time to seek Jehovah till he shall come and cast justice upon you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Ye ploughed injustice, ye reaped iniquity; ye ate the fruit of falsehood: for thou didst trust in thy way in the multitude of thy strong ones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And an uproar arose among thy people, and all thy fortifications shall be laid waste, as Shaman laid waste the house of the ambush of God in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon the sons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thus did the house of God to you from the face of the evil of your evil: in the morning the king of Israel being cut off, was cut off.</p>
