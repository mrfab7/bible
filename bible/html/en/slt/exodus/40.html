<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">In the day of the first month, in the one of the month, thou shalt raise up the dwelling of the tent of the appointment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And put there the ark of the testimony, and cover over the ark with the vail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And bring in the table and arrange its arrangement; and bring in the chandelier and raise up its lamps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And set the altar of gold for incense before the ark of the testimony, and put the covering of the door to the dwelling.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And set the altar of the burnt-offering before the door of the dwelling of the tent of appointment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And set the wash-basin between the tent of appointment and between the altar, and set water there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And put the enclosure round about, and give the covering of the gate of the enclosure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And take the oil of anointing, and anoint the dwelling and all that is in it, and consecrate it, and all its vessels: and it was holy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And anoint the altar of burnt-offering and all its vessels, and consecrate the altar: and the altar was the holy of holies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And anoint the wash-basin and its foot, and consecrate it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And bring near Aaron and his sons to the door of the tent of appointment and wash them in water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And put upon Aaron the garments of the holy place, and anoint him and consecrate him; and he was priest to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And his sons thou shalt bring near, and put tunics upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And anoint them as thou didst anoint their father, and they were priests to me; and it was to be to them an anointing for the priesthood forever for their generations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Moses will do according to all which Jehovah commanded him; so did he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And it will be in the first month, in the second year, in the one of the month, the dwelling was raised up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Moses will raise up the dwelling and will set its bases, and will put up its boards, and will give its bars, and will raise up its pillars.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And he will spread out the tent upon the dwelling, and will put the covering of the tent upon it from above; as Jehovah commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And he will take and give the testimony to the ark, and will put the poles upon the ark and will give the cover upon the ark from above.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And he will bring the ark to the dwelling and will put up the vail of the covering, and he will cover over the ark of the testimony; as Jehovah commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And he will give the table in the tent of appointment, upon the thigh of the dwelling northward from without the vail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he will set in order upon it the arrangement for the bread before Jehovah; as Jehovah commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And he put the chandelier in the tent of appointment, opposite the table, upon the thigh of the dwelling southward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And he will raise up the lamps before Jehovah, as Jehovah commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And he will put the altar of gold in the tent of appointment, before the vail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And he will burn upon it incense of aromatics; as Jehovah commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And he will put up the covering of the door of the dwelling.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And the altar of burnt-offering he put at the door of the dwelling of the tent of appointment, and he will bring up upon it the burnt-offering and the gift; as Jehovah commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And he will put up the washbasin between the tent of appointment and between the altar, and he will give there water to wash.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed from it their hands and their feet:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">In their going into the tent of appointment, and in their drawing near to the altar, they will wash; as Jehovah commanded Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And he will raise up the enclosure round about to the dwelling and to the altar, and he will give the covering of the gate of the enclosure: and Moses will finish the work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And a cloud will cover the tent of appointment, and the glory of Jehovah filled the dwelling.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And Moses was not able to come in to the tent of appointment, for the cloud settled down upon it, and the glory of Jehovah filled the dwelling.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And in the going up of the cloud from above the dwelling, the sons of Israel removed in all their departures.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And if the cloud shall not go up, they will not remove till the day it went up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">For the cloud of Jehovah was upon the dwelling the day, and fire was upon it the night, in the eyes of all the house of Israel in all their departures.</p>
