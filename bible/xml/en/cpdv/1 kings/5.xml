  <verse number="1">Hiram, the king of Tyre, also sent his servants to Solomon. For he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father. Now Hiram had been a friend to David the entire time.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Then Solomon sent to Hiram, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="3">“You know the will of my father David, and that he was not able to build a house to the name of the Lord his God, because of the wars that were imminent all around him, until the Lord set them under the steps of his feet.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But now the Lord my God has given rest to me on all sides. And there is no adversary, nor occurrence of evil.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For this reason, I intend to build a temple to the name of the Lord my God, just as the Lord spoke to my father David, saying: ‘Your son, whom I will set in your place, upon your throne, he himself shall build a house to my name.’</verse>
  <verse number="6">Therefore, order that your servants may cut down for me cedars from Lebanon. And let my servants be with your servants. Then I will give to you, for the wages of your servants, whatever you will ask. For you know that there is not a man among my people who knows how to cut wood as well as the Sidonians.”</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore, when Hiram had heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly, and he said, “Blessed be the Lord God this day, who gave to David a very wise son over this numerous people!”</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying: “I have heard the things that you would entrust to me. And I will do your whole will concerning the cedar trees and spruce trees.</verse>
  <verse number="9">My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea. And I will arrange them together as rafts on the sea, as far as the place that you will indicate to me. And I will land them there, and you will take them. And you shall offer to me what is necessary to give food to my house.”</verse>
  <verse number="10">And so, Hiram gave to Solomon cedar trees and spruce trees, in accord with his whole will.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then Solomon offered to Hiram twenty thousand cor of wheat, as food for his house, and twenty cor of the purest oil. These things Solomon gave as a tribute to Hiram every year.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the Lord gave wisdom to Solomon, just as he said to him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two struck a pact.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And king Solomon chose workers from all of Israel, and the conscription was of thirty thousand men.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he sent them into Lebanon, ten thousand each month, in turns, so that for two months they were in their own houses. And Adoniram was over this type of conscription.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Solomon had seventy thousand of those who were carrying burdens, and eighty thousand of those who cut stones from the mountain,</verse>
  <verse number="16">aside from the commanders who were over each work, in number three thousand and three hundred, who gave orders to the people and to those who were doing the work.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the king ordered them to bring great stones, precious stones, for the foundation of the temple, and to square them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And these were shaped by the stoneworkers of Solomon and the stoneworkers of Hiram. And the men of Gebal also prepared the wood and the stones in order to build the house.</verse>
