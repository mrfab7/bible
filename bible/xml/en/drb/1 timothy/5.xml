<chapter book="1 Timothy" number="5" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">An ancient man rebuke not, but entreat him as a father: young men, as brethren:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Old women, as mothers: young women, as sisters, in all chastity.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Honour widows, that are widows indeed.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But if any widow have children, or grandchildren, let her learn first to govern her own house, and to make a return of duty to her parents: for this is acceptable before God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, let her trust in God, and continue in supplications and prayers night and day.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For she that liveth in pleasures, is dead while she is living.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And this give in charge, that they may be blameless.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But if any man have not care of his own, and especially of those of his house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Let a widow be chosen of no less than threescore years of age, who hath been the wife of one husband.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Having testimony for her good works, if she have brought up children, if she have received to harbour, if she have washed the saints’ feet, if she have ministered to them that suffer tribulation, if she have diligently followed every good work.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But the younger widows avoid. For when they have grown wanton in Christ, they will marry:</verse>
  <verse number="12">Having damnation, because they have made void their first faith.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And withal being idle they learn to go about from house to house: and are not only idle, but tattlers also, and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I will therefore that the younger should marry, bear children, be mistresses of families, give no occasion to the adversary to speak evil.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For some are already turned aside after Satan.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If any of the faithful have widows, let him minister to them, and let not the church be charged: that there may be sufficient for them that are widows indeed.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Let the priests that rule well, be esteemed worthy of double honour: especially they who labour in the word and doctrine:</verse>
  <verse number="18">For the scripture saith: Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn: and, The labourer is worthy of his reward.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Against a priest receive not an accusation, but under two or three witnesses.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Them that sin reprove before all: that the rest also may have fear.</verse>
  <verse number="21">I charge thee before God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing by declining to either side.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Impose not hands lightly upon any man, neither be partaker of other men’s sins. Keep thyself chaste.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Do not still drink water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake, and thy frequent infirmities.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Some men’s sins are manifest, going before to judgment: and some men they follow after.</verse>
  <verse number="25">In like manner also good deeds are manifest: and they that are otherwise, cannot be hid.</verse>
