<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah answereth Job out of the whirlwind, and saith:—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Who is this—darkening counsel, By words without knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Gird, I pray thee, as a man, thy loins, And I ask thee, and cause thou Me to know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Where wast thou when I founded earth? Declare, if thou hast known understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who placed its measures—if thou knowest? Or who hath stretched out upon it a line?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">On what have its sockets been sunk? Or who hath cast its corner-stone?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In the singing together of stars of morning, And all sons of God shout for joy,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And He shutteth up with doors the sea, In its coming forth, from the womb it goeth out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">In My making a cloud its clothing, And thick darkness its swaddling band,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I measure over it My statute, And place bar and doors,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And say, ‘Hitherto come thou, and add not, And a command is placed On the pride of thy billows.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Hast thou commanded morning since thy days? Causest thou the dawn to know its place?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">To take hold on the skirts of the earth, And the wicked are shaken out of it,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">It turneth itself as clay of a seal And they station themselves as clothed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And withheld from the wicked is their light, And the arm lifted up is broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Hast thou come in to springs of the sea? And in searching the deep Hast thou walked up and down?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Revealed to thee were the gates of death? And the gates of death-shade dost thou see?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Thou hast understanding, Even unto the broad places of earth! Declare—if thou hast known it all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Where is this—the way light dwelleth? And darkness, where is this—its place?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">That thou dost take it unto its boundary, And that thou dost understand The paths of its house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Thou hast known—for then thou art born And the number of thy days are many!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Hast thou come in unto the treasure of snow? Yea, the treasures of hail dost thou see?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">That I have kept back for a time of distress, For a day of conflict and battle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Where is this, the way light is apportioned? It scattereth an east wind over the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Who hath divided for the flood a conduit? And a way for the lightning of the voices?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">To cause it to rain on a land—no man, A wilderness—no man in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">To satisfy a desolate and waste place, And to cause to shoot up The produce of the tender grass?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Hath the rain a father? Or who hath begotten the drops of dew?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">From whose belly came forth the ice? And the hoar-frost of the heavens, Who hath begotten it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">As a stone waters are hidden, And the face of the deep is captured.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Dost thou bind sweet influences of Kimah? Or the attractions of Kesil dost thou open?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Dost thou bring out Mazzaroth in its season? And Aysh for her sons dost thou comfort?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Hast thou known the statutes of heaven? Or dost thou appoint Its dominion in the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Dost thou lift up to the cloud thy voice, And abundance of water doth cover thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Dost thou send out lightnings, and they go And say unto thee, ‘Behold us?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Who hath put in the inward parts wisdom? Or who hath given To the covered part understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Who doth number the clouds by wisdom? And the bottles of the heavens, Who doth cause to lie down,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">In the hardening of dust into hardness, And clods cleave together?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Dost thou hunt for a lion prey? And the desire of young lions fulfil?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">When they bow down in dens—Abide in a thicket for a covert?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Who doth prepare for a raven his provision, When his young ones cry unto God? They wander without food.</p>
