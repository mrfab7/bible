<chapter book="Amos" number="8" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Thus has the Lord GOD showed to me: and behold a basket of summer fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he said, Amos, what see you? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the LORD to me, The end is come on my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, said the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast them forth with silence.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Hear this, O you that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn? and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit?</verse>
  <verse number="6">That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yes, and sell the refuse of the wheat?</verse>
  <verse number="7">The LORD has sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwells therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And it shall come to pass in that day, said the Lord GOD, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day:</verse>
  <verse number="10">And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Behold, the days come, said the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it.</verse>
  <verse number="13">In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.</verse>
  <verse number="14">They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Your god, O Dan, lives; and, The manner of Beersheba lives; even they shall fall, and never rise up again.</verse>
