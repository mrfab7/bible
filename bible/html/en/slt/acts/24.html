<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And after five days the chief priest Ananias came down with the elders, and a certain orator, Tertullus, who exhibited to the leader against Paul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he having been called, Tertullus began to accuse, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Attaining much peace by thee, and good actions being to this nation by thy foresight altogether and everywhere, we accept, most excellent Felix, with all thankfulness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And that I hinder thee no more, I beseech thee to hear us concisely by thy clemency.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For having found this man a scourge, and moving sedition to all Jews in the habitable globe, and standing in the first rank of the sect of Nazarites:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And who attempted to profane the temple: whom we also seized, and wished to judge according to our law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And Lysias the captain of a thousand, having come with much force, carried away out of our hands,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Having commanded his accusers to come to thee: by which thou thyself shalt be able, having examined, to know of all these of which we accuse him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the Jews also agreed, saying, these things hold so.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Paul answered, the leader having nodded to him to speak, Knowing from many years thee being judge to this nation, more cheerfully do I justify things concerning myself:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Thou being able to know that not more than twelve days are to me from which I went up, going to worship in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And neither in the temple found they me discussing with any, or making a revolt of the crowd, neither in synagogues, nor in the city:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Nor can they bring me forward for things they now accuse me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And this I confess to thee, that according to the way which they call a sect, so serve I the God of the fathers, believing all things written in the law and the prophets:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Having hope to God, which they themselves also admit, a rising from the dead about to be, both of just and unjust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And in this I myself attend carefully, to have a conscience unhurt towards God and men always.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And after many years I was present, going to do alms to my nation, and offerings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">In which they found me purified in the temple, not with the crowd, nor with uproar, and certain Jews from Asia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Who ought to be present to thee, and accuse, if they have anything against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Or let these themselves say, if they found any injustice in me, I having stood before the council,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Or of this one voice, which I cried standing with them, That of the rising up of the dead I am judged this day by you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And having heard these, Felix deferred them, knowing more accurately the things of the way, having said, When Lysias captain of a thousand shall come down, I will examine narrowly things concerning you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And having appointed a centurion to keep Paul, and to have a setting at liberty, and to hinder none of his own to serve or come to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And after certain days, Felix, having been present with Drusilla his wife, being a Jewess, sent for Paul and heard him of the faith in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And he discoursing of justice, and temperance, and judgment about to be, Felix being terrified, answered, Having now, go; having taken time, I will recall thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And at the same time also hoping that money should be given him by Paul, so that he might loose him: wherefore also sending for him more frequently, he conversed with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And two years completed, Felix took Porcius Festus, a successor: and wishing to render a favor to the Jews, Felix left Paul bound.</p>
