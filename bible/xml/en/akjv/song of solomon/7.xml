<chapter book="Song of Solomon" number="7" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">How beautiful are your feet with shoes, O prince’s daughter! the joints of your thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Your navel is like a round goblet, which wants not liquor: your belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Your two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Your neck is as a tower of ivory; your eyes like the fish pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: your nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Your head on you is like Carmel, and the hair of your head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.</verse>
  <verse number="6">How fair and how pleasant are you, O love, for delights!</verse>
  <verse number="7">This your stature is like to a palm tree, and your breasts to clusters of grapes.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also your breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of your nose like apples;</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the roof of your mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goes down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I am my beloved’s, and his desire is toward me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give you my loves.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved.</verse>
