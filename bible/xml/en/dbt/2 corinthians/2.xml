<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="2" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But I have judged this with myself, not to come back to you in grief.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For if I grieve you, who also [is] it that gladdens me, if not he that is grieved through me?</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I have written this very [letter] [to you], that coming I may not have grief from those from whom I ought to have joy; trusting in you all that my joy is [that] of you all.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For out of much tribulation and distress of heart I wrote to you, with many tears; not that ye may be grieved, but that ye may know the love which I have very abundantly towards you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But if any one has grieved, he has grieved, not me, but in part (that I may not overcharge [you]) all of you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Sufficient to such a one [is] this rebuke which [has been inflicted] by the many;</verse>
  <verse number="7">so that on the contrary ye should rather shew grace and encourage, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with excessive grief.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Wherefore I exhort you to assure him of [your] love.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For to this end also I have written, that I might know, by putting you to the test, if as to everything ye are obedient.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But to whom ye forgive anything, I also; for I also, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, [it is] for your sakes in [the] person of Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="11">that we might not have Satan get an advantage against us, for we are not ignorant of his thoughts.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now when I came to Troas for the [publication of the] glad tidings of the Christ, a door also being opened to me in [the] Lord,</verse>
  <verse number="13">I had no rest in my spirit at not finding Titus my brother; but bidding them adieu, I came away to Macedonia.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But thanks [be] to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ, and makes manifest the odour of his knowledge through us in every place.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For we are a sweet odour of Christ to God, in the saved and in those that perish:</verse>
  <verse number="16">to the one an odour from death unto death, but to the others an odour from life unto life; and who [is] sufficient for these things?</verse>
  <verse number="17">For we do not, as the many, make a trade of the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as of God, before God, we speak in Christ.</verse>
