  <verse number="1">For this reason I Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles—</verse>
  <verse number="2">if, that is, you have heard of the work which God has graciously entrusted to me for your benefit,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and that by a revelation the truth hitherto kept secret was made known to me as I have already briefly explained it to you.</verse>
  <verse number="4">By means of that explanation, as you read it, you can judge of my insight into the truth of Christ</verse>
  <verse number="5">which in earlier ages was not made known to the human race, as it has now been revealed to His holy Apostles and Prophets through the Spirit—</verse>
  <verse number="6">I mean the truth that the Gentiles are joint heirs with us Jews, and that they form one body with us, and have the same interest as we have in the promise which has been made good in Christ Jesus through the Good News,</verse>
  <verse number="7">in which I have been appointed to serve, in virtue of the work which God, in the exercise of His power within me, has graciously entrusted to me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">To me who am less than the least of all God’s people has this work been graciously entrusted—to proclaim to the Gentiles the Good News of the exhaustless wealth of Christ,</verse>
  <verse number="9">and to show all men in a clear light what my stewardship is. It is the stewardship of the truth which from all the Ages lay concealed in the mind of God, the Creator of all things—</verse>
  <verse number="10">concealed in order that the Church might now be used to display to the powers and authorities in the heavenly realms the innumerable aspects of God’s wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Such was the eternal purpose which He had formed in Christ Jesus our Lord,</verse>
  <verse number="12">in whom we have this bold and confident access through our faith in Him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Therefore I entreat you not to lose heart in the midst of my sufferings on your behalf, for they bring you honour.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For this reason, on bended knee I beseech the Father,</verse>
  <verse number="15">from whom the whole family in Heaven and on earth derives its name,</verse>
  <verse number="16">to grant you—in accordance with the wealth of His glorious perfections—to be strengthened by His Spirit with power penetrating to your inmost being.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I pray that Christ may make His home in your hearts through your faith; so that having your roots deep and your foundations strong, in love, you may become mighty to grasp the idea,</verse>
  <verse number="18">as it is grasped by all God’s people, of the breadth and length, the height and depth—</verse>
  <verse number="19">yes, to attain to a knowledge of the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, so that you may be made complete in accordance with God’s own standard of completeness.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Now to Him who, in exercise of His power that is at work within us, is able to do infinitely beyond all our highest prayers or thoughts—</verse>
  <verse number="21">to Him be the glory in the Church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, world without end! Amen.</verse>
