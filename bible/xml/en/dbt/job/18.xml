  <verse number="1">And Bildad the Shuhite answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">How long will ye hunt for words? Be intelligent, and then we will speak.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed stupid in your sight?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thou that tearest thyself in thine anger, shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of its place?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the flame of his fire shall not shine.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The light shall become dark in his tent, and his lamp over him shall be put out.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For he is sent into the net by his own feet, and he walketh on the meshes;</verse>
  <verse number="9">The gin taketh [him] by the heel, the snare layeth hold on him;</verse>
  <verse number="10">A cord is hidden for him in the ground, and his trap in the way.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Terrors make him afraid on every side, and chase him at his footsteps.</verse>
  <verse number="12">His strength is hunger-bitten, and calamity is ready at his side.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The firstborn of death devoureth the members of his body; it will devour his members.</verse>
  <verse number="14">His confidence shall be rooted out of his tent, and it shall lead him away to the king of terrors:</verse>
  <verse number="15">They who are none of his shall dwell in his tent; brimstone shall be showered upon his habitation:</verse>
  <verse number="16">His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off;</verse>
  <verse number="17">His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name on the pasture-grounds.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He is driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He hath neither son nor grandson among his people, nor any remaining in the places of his sojourn.</verse>
  <verse number="20">They that come after shall be astonished at his day, as they that went before [them] were affrighted.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Surely, such are the dwellings of the unrighteous man, and such the place of him that knoweth not God.</verse>
