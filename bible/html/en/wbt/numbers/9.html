<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at its appointed season.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">In the fourteenth day of this month, at evening, ye shall keep it in its appointed season: according to all its rites, and according to all its ceremonies, shall ye keep it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, that they should keep the passover.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at evening in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And those men said to him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: why are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in its appointed season among the children of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Moses said to them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Speak to the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The fourteenth day of the second month at evening, they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They shall leave none of it to the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover to the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner of it, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And on the day that the tabernacle was erected the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at evening there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">So it was always; the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they encamped: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And so it was, when the cloud abode from evening to the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Or whether it was two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining upon it, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</p>
