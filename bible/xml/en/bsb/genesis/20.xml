  <verse number="1">Now Abraham journeyed from there to the region of the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he was staying in Gerar,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Abraham said of his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.” So Abimelech king of Gerar had Sarah brought to him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">One night, however, God came to Abimelech in a dream and told him, “You are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken, for she is a married woman.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">Now Abimelech had not gone near her, so he replied, “Lord, would You destroy a nation even though it is innocent?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Didn’t Abraham tell me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ I have done this in the integrity of my heart and the innocence of my hands.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then God said to Abimelech in the dream, “Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience, and so I have kept you from sinning against Me. That is why I did not let you touch her.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet; he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not restore her, be aware that you will surely die—you and all who belong to you.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">Early the next morning Abimelech got up and summoned all his servants; and when he described to them all that had happened, the men were terrified.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then Abimelech called Abraham and asked, “What have you done to us? How have I sinned against you, that you have brought such tremendous guilt upon me and my kingdom? You have done things to me that should not be done.”</verse>
  <verse number="10">Abimelech also asked Abraham, “What prompted you to do such a thing?”</verse>
  <verse number="11">Abraham replied, “I thought to myself, ‘Surely there is no fear of God in this place. They will kill me on account of my wife.’</verse>
  <verse number="12">Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father—though not the daughter of my mother—and she became my wife.</verse>
  <verse number="13">So when God had me journey from my father’s house, I said to Sarah, ‘This is how you can show your loyalty to me: Wherever we go, say of me, “He is my brother.”’”</verse>
  <verse number="14">So Abimelech brought sheep and cattle, menservants and maidservants, and he gave them to Abraham and restored his wife Sarah to him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Abimelech said, “Look, my land is before you. Settle wherever you please.”</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he said to Sarah, “See, I am giving your brother a thousand pieces of silver. It is your vindication before all who are with you; you are completely cleared.”</verse>
  <verse number="17">Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maidservants, so that they could again bear children—</verse>
  <verse number="18">for on account of Abraham’s wife Sarah, the LORD had completely closed all the wombs in Abimelech’s household.</verse>
