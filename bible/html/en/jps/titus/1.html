<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, a bondservant of God and an Apostle of Jesus Christ for building up the faith of God’s own people and spreading a full knowledge of the truths of religion,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">in hope of the Life of the Ages which God, who is never false to His word, promised before the commencement of the Ages.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And at the appointed time He clearly made known His Message in the preaching with which I was entrusted by the command of God our Saviour:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To Titus my own true child in our common faith. May grace and peace be granted to you from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Saviour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I have left you behind in Crete in order that you may set right the things which still require attention, and appoint Elders in every town, as I directed you to do;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">wherever there is a man of blameless life, true to his one wife, having children who are themselves believers and are free from every reproach of profligacy or of stubborn self-will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For, as God’s steward, a minister must be of blameless life, not over-fond of having his own way, not a man of a passionate temper nor a hard drinker, not given to blows nor greedy of gain,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">but hospitable to strangers, a lover of goodness, sober-minded, upright, saintly, self-controlled;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">holding fast to the faithful Message which he has received, so that he may be well qualified both to encourage others with sound teaching and to reply successfully to opponents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For there are many that spurn authority—idle, talkative and deceitful persons, who, for the most part, are adherents of the Circumcision.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">You must stop the mouths of such men, for they overthrow the faith of whole families, teaching what they ought not, just for the sake of making money.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">One of their own number—a Prophet who is a countryman of theirs—has said, “Cretans are always liars, dangerous animals, idle gluttons.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">This testimony is true. Therefore sternly denounce them, that they may be robust in their faith,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and not give attention to Jewish legends and the maxims of men who turn their backs on the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">To the pure everything is pure; but to the polluted and unbelieving nothing is pure, but on the contrary their very minds and consciences are polluted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">They profess to know God; but in their actions they disown Him, and are detestable and disobedient men, and for any good work are utterly useless.</p>
