1	And Bildad the Shuhite will answer and say,
2	Dominion and fear with him; he made peace in his heights.
3	Is there a number to his troops? and upon whom shall not his light arise?
4	And how shall man be justified with God? and how shall he born of woman be clean?
5	Behold even to the moon, and it shall not shine; and the stars were not clean in his eyes.
6	How much less man, a worm; and the son of man, a worm.
