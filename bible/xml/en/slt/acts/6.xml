  <verse number="1">And in those days, the disciples multiplying, there was a murmuring of the Greeks against the Hebrews, because their widows were overlooked in the daily service.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the twelve having called the multitude of the disciples, said, It is not pleasing for us, having left the word of God, to serve tables.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Therefore, survey, brethren, seven men of you, being witnesses full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom ye shall set over this need.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And we will persevere in prayer, and the service of the word.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the word pleased before all the multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:</verse>
  <verse number="6">Whom they set before the sent: and having prayed, they put hands upon them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the word of God increased: and the number of disciples was multiplied greatly in Jerusalem; and a great crowd of priests listened to the faith.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and signs among the people.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And certain of them arose from the synagogue, called Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrian, and of them from Cilicia and Asia, seeking out with Stephen.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then they put under men, saying, That we have heard him speaking defaming words against Moses, and God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they roused together the people, and elders, and scribes, and having stood against, they seized him, and brought to the council,</verse>
  <verse number="13">And set false witnesses, saying, This man ceases not speaking defaming words against this holy place, and the law:</verse>
  <verse number="14">For we have heard him saying; That Jesus the Nazarite shall abolish this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered to us.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And all they sitting in the council, having looked intently upon him, saw his face as the face of a messenger.</verse>
