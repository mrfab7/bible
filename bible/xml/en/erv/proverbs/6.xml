<chapter book="Proverbs" number="6" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My son, if thou art become surety for thy neighbour, if thou hast stricken thy hands for a stranger,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbour; go, humble thyself, and importune thy neighbour.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:</verse>
  <verse number="7">Which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,</verse>
  <verse number="8">Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.</verse>
  <verse number="9">How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</verse>
  <verse number="11">So shall thy poverty come as a robber, and thy want as an armed man.</verse>
  <verse number="12">A worthless person, a man of iniquity; he walketh with a froward mouth;</verse>
  <verse number="13">He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he maketh signs with his fingers;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth evil continually; he soweth discord.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; on a sudden shall he be broken and that without remedy.</verse>
  <verse number="16">There be six things which the LORD hateth; yea, seven which are an abomination unto him:</verse>
  <verse number="17">Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood;</verse>
  <verse number="18">An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief;</verse>
  <verse number="19">A false witness that uttereth lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My son, keep the commandment of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:</verse>
  <verse number="21">Bind them continually upon thine heart, tie them about thy neck.</verse>
  <verse number="22">When thou walkest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall watch over thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:</verse>
  <verse number="24">To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the stranger’s tongue.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For on account of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress hunteth for the precious life.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?</verse>
  <verse number="28">Or can one walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?</verse>
  <verse number="29">So he that goeth in to his nieghbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be unpunished.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry:</verse>
  <verse number="31">But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.</verse>
  <verse number="32">He that committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding: he doeth it that would destroy his own soul.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Wounds and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For jealousy is the rage of a man; and he will not spare in the day of vengeance.</verse>
  <verse number="35">He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.</verse>
