<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="14" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Follow after love; yet desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For he that speaketh in a tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God; for no man understandeth; but in the spirit he speaketh mysteries.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men edification, and comfort, and consolation.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He that speaketh in a tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now I would have you all speak with tongues, but rather that ye should prophesy: and greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, unless I speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophesying, or of teaching?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Even things without life, giving a voice, whether pipe or harp, if they give not a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?</verse>
  <verse number="8">For if the trumpet give an uncertain voice, who shall prepare himself for war?</verse>
  <verse number="9">So also ye, unless ye utter by the tongue speech easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye will be speaking into the air.</verse>
  <verse number="10">There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and no kind is without signification.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If then I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh will be a barbarian unto me.</verse>
  <verse number="12">So also ye, since ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may abound unto the edifying of the church.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Wherefore let him that speaketh in a tongue pray that he may interpret.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.</verse>
  <verse number="15">What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Else if thou bless with the spirit, how shall he that filleth the place of the unlearned say the Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he knoweth not what thou sayest?</verse>
  <verse number="17">For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I thank God, I speak with tongues more than you all:</verse>
  <verse number="19">howbeit in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Brethren, be not children in mind: howbeit in malice be ye babes, but in mind be men.</verse>
  <verse number="21">In the law it is written, By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers will I speak unto this people; and not even thus will they hear me, saith the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to the unbelieving: but prophesying is for a sign, not to the unbelieving, but to them that believe.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If therefore the whole church be assembled together, and all speak with tongues, and there come in men unlearned or unbelieving, will they not say that ye are mad?</verse>
  <verse number="24">But if all prophesy, and there come in one unbelieving or unlearned, he is reproved by all, he is judged by all;</verse>
  <verse number="25">the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so he will fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God is among you indeed.</verse>
  <verse number="26">What is it then, brethren? When ye come together, each one hath a psalm, hath a teaching, hath a revelation, hath a tongue, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying.</verse>
  <verse number="27">If any man speaketh in a tongue, let it be by two, or at the most three, and that in turn; and let one interpret:</verse>
  <verse number="28">but if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And let the prophets speak by two or three, and let the others discern.</verse>
  <verse number="30">But if a revelation be made to another sitting by, let the first keep silence.</verse>
  <verse number="31">For ye all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted;</verse>
  <verse number="32">and the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets;</verse>
  <verse number="33">for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace; as in all the churches of the saints.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Let the women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but let them be in subjection, as also saith the law.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And if they would learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home: for it is shameful for a woman to speak in the church.</verse>
  <verse number="36">What? was it from you that the word of God went forth? or came it unto you alone?</verse>
  <verse number="37">If any man thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him take knowledge of the things which I write unto you, that they are the commandment of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="38">But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</verse>
  <verse number="39">Wherefore, my brethren, desire earnestly to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.</verse>
  <verse number="40">But let all things be done decently and in order.</verse>
