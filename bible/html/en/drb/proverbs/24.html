<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="24" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Seek not to be like evil men, neither desire to be with them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Because their mind studieth robberies, and their lips speak deceits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">By wisdom the house shall be built, and by prudence it shall be strengthened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">By instruction the storerooms shall be filled with all precious and most beautiful wealth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A wise man is strong: and a knowing man, stout and valiant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Because war is managed by due ordering: and there shall be safety where there are many counsels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wisdom is too high for a fool, in the gate he shall not open his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that deviseth to do evils, shall be called a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The thought of a fool is sin: and the detracter is the abomination of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If thou lose hope being weary in the day of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Deliver them that are led to death: and those that are drawn to death forbear not to deliver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If thou say: I have not strength enough: he that seeth into the heart, he understandeth, and nothing deceiveth the keeper of thy soul, end he shall render to a man according to his works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Fat honey, my son, because it is good, and the honeycomb most sweet to thy throat:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">So also is the doctrine of wisdom to thy soul: which when thou hast found, thou shalt have hope in the end, and thy hope shall not perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Lie not in wait, nor seek after wickedness in the house of the just, nor spoil his rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For a just man shall fall seven times and shall rise again: but the wicked shall fall down into evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">When thy enemy shall fall, be not glad, and in his ruin let not thy heart rejoice:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Lest the Lord see, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Contend not with the wicked, nor seek to be like the ungodly:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For evil men have no hope of things to come, and the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">My son, fear the Lord and the king: and have nothing to do with detracters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For their destruction shall rise suddenly: and who knoweth the ruin of both?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">These things also to the wise: It is not good to have respect to persons in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">They that say to the wicked man: Thou art just: shall be cursed by the people, and the tribes shall abhor them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">They that rebuke him, shall be praised: and a blessing shall come upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He shall kiss the lips, who answereth right words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Prepare thy work without, and diligently till thy ground: that afterward thou mayst build thy house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Be not witness without cause against thy neighbour: and deceive not any man with thy lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Say not: I will do to him as he hath done to me: I will render to every one according to his work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">I passed by the field of the slothful man, and by the vineyard of the foolish man:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And behold it was all filled with nettles, and thorns had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall was broken down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Which when I had seen, I laid it up in my heart, and by the example I received instruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Thou wilt sleep a little, said I, thou wilt slumber a little, thou wilt fold thy hands a little to rest:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And poverty shall come to thee as a runner, and beggary as an armed man.</p>
