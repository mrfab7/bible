  <verse number="1">But do thou speak the things that become sound teaching;</verse>
  <verse number="2">that the elder men be sober, grave, discreet, sound in faith, in love, in patience;</verse>
  <verse number="3">that the elder women in like manner be in deportment as becoming those who have to say to sacred things, not slanderers, not enslaved to much wine, teachers of what is right;</verse>
  <verse number="4">that they may admonish the young women to be attached to [their] husbands, to be attached to [their] children,</verse>
  <verse number="5">discreet, chaste, diligent in home work, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The younger men in like manner exhort to be discreet:</verse>
  <verse number="7">in all things affording thyself as a pattern of good works; in teaching uncorruptedness, gravity,</verse>
  <verse number="8">a sound word, not to be condemned; that he who is opposed may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us:</verse>
  <verse number="9">bondmen to be subject to their own masters, to make themselves acceptable in everything; not gainsaying;</verse>
  <verse number="10">not robbing [their masters], but shewing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the teaching which [is] of our Saviour God in all things.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the grace of God which carries with it salvation for all men has appeared,</verse>
  <verse number="12">teaching us that, having denied impiety and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, and justly, and piously in the present course of things,</verse>
  <verse number="13">awaiting the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="14">who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all lawlessness, and purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous for good works.</verse>
  <verse number="15">These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise thee.</verse>
