  <verse number="1">Also, he made a brass altar of twenty cubits in length, and of twenty cubits in width, and of ten cubits in height,</verse>
  <verse number="2">as well as a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in its circumference. It had five cubits in height, and a line of thirty cubits went around it on all sides.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Also, under it there was the likeness of oxen. And certain engravings encircled the cavity of the sea, along ten cubits of the outside, as if in two rows. Now the oxen were molten.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the sea itself was placed upon the twelve oxen, three of which were looking toward the north, and another three toward the west, then another three toward the south, and the three that remained toward the east, having the sea imposed upon them. But the posteriors of the oxen were toward the interior, under the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now its thickness had the measure of the palm of a hand, and its brim was like the lip of a cup, or like the outturned petal of a lily. And it held three thousand measures.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Also, he made ten basins. And he placed five on the right, and five on the left, so that they might wash in them all the things that they were to offer as holocausts. But the priests were to be washed in the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then he also made ten gold lampstands, according to the form by which they had been ordered to be made. And he set them in the temple, five on the right, and five on the left.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Moreover, there were also ten tables. And he placed them in the temple, five on the right, and five on the left. Also, there were one hundred gold bowls.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then too, he made the court of the priests, and a great hall, and doors in the hall, which he covered with brass.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Now he placed the sea on the right side, facing the east, toward the south.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then Hiram made cooking pots and hooks and bowls. And he completed every work of the king in the house of God,</verse>
  <verse number="12">that is, the two pillars, and the crossbeams, and the heads, and something like a little net, which would cover the heads above the crossbeams,</verse>
  <verse number="13">and also four hundred pomegranates, and two little nets, so that two rows of pomegranates were joined to each net, which would cover the crossbeams and the heads of the pillars.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He also made bases; and basins that he placed upon the bases;</verse>
  <verse number="15">one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea;</verse>
  <verse number="16">and cooking pots and hooks and bowls. Hiram, his father, made all the vessels for Solomon, in the house of the Lord, from the purest brass.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The king cast these in the region near the Jordan, in the clay soil between Succoth and Zeredah.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Now the multitude of the vessels was innumerable, so much so that the weight of the brass was unknown.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Solomon made all the vessels for the house of God, and the gold altar, and the tables upon which were the bread of the presence;</verse>
  <verse number="20">and also, of the purest gold, the lampstands with their lamps, to shine before the oracle, according to the rite;</verse>
  <verse number="21">and certain flowers, and lamps, and gold tongs. All these were made from the purest gold.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Also, the vessels for the perfumes, and the censers, and the bowls, and the little mortars were from the purest gold. And he engraved the doors of the inner temple, that is, for the Holy of Holies. And the doors of the outer temple were of gold. And so, every work was completed that Solomon made in the house of the Lord.</verse>
