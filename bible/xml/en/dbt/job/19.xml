<chapter book="Job" number="19" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And Job answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">How long will ye vex my soul, and crush me with words?</verse>
  <verse number="3">These ten times have ye reproached me; ye are not ashamed to stupefy me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And be it [that] I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.</verse>
  <verse number="5">If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and prove against me my reproach,</verse>
  <verse number="6">Know now that +God hath overthrown me, and hath surrounded me with his net.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Behold, I cry out of wrong, and I am not heard; I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He hath hedged up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He breaketh me down on every side, and I am gone; and my hope hath he torn up as a tree.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he hath kindled his anger against me, and hath counted me unto him as one of his enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="12">His troops have come together and cast up their way against me, and have encamped round about my tent.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are quite estranged from me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">My kinsfolk have failed, and my known friends have forgotten me.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The sojourners in my house and my maids count me as a stranger; I am an alien in their sight.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I called my servant, and he answered not; I entreated him with my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">My breath is strange to my wife, and my entreaties to the children of my [mother’s] womb.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Even young children despise me; I rise up, and they speak against me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">All my intimate friends abhor me, and they whom I loved are turned against me.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My bones cleave to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, ye my friends; for the hand of +God hath touched me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Oh would that my words were written! oh that they were inscribed in a book!</verse>
  <verse number="24">That with an iron style and lead they were graven in the rock for ever!</verse>
  <verse number="25">And [as for] me, I know that my Redeemer liveth, and the Last, he shall stand upon the earth;</verse>
  <verse number="26">And [if] after my skin this shall be destroyed, yet from out of my flesh shall I see +God;</verse>
  <verse number="27">Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another:—my reins are consumed within me.</verse>
  <verse number="28">If ye say, How shall we persecute him? when the root of the matter is found in me,</verse>
  <verse number="29">Be ye yourselves afraid of the sword! for the sword is fury against misdeeds, that ye may know there is a judgment.</verse>
