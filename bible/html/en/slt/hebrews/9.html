<div class="chapter" data-book="Hebrews" data-chapter="9" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And truly therefore the first had precepts of divine service for him, and a worldly holy place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For the first tent was prepared; (in which was the chandelier, and table, and the setting up of the loaves;) which is called holy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And after the second veil, the tent called Holy of Holies;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Having the golden censer, and ark of the covenant surrounded on all sides with gold, in which was the golden urn having the manna, and Aaronâ€™s rod having budded, and the tables of the covenant;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And above it the cherubs of glory overshadowing the propitiatory; of which it is not now to speak in turn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And these thus prepared, truly to the first tent the priests always came in, to complete the divine services.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And into the second the chief priest alone once a year, not without blood, which he brings near for himself, and the errors of the people:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">This the Holy Spirit designating, the way of the holies had not yet been made manifest, the first tent yet having a standing:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Which a parable for the time placed in, according to which both gifts and sacrifices are brought near, not being able for consciousness to perfect him serving;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Only in food and drinks, and different immersions, and precepts of the flesh, being placed till the time of amendment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Christ being present, a chief priest of good things about to be, by a greater and more perfect tent, not made with hands, that is; not of this creation;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Neither by the blood of he-goats and calves, and by his own blood he went in once for all to the holies, having found eternal deliverance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For if the blood of bulls and he-goats, and the ashes of a heifer besprinkling the polluted, consecrates to the purity of the flesh:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself blameless to God, purify your consciousness from dead works to serve the living God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And for this he is mediator of a new covenant, that death having been, for redemption of the transgressions for the first covenant, the called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For where a will, the necessity for the death of him having willed to be brought forward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For a will is firm by the dead: since it has no power when he having willed lives.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Wherefore neither was the first consecrated without blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For every command spoken according to law by Moses, to all the people, having taken the blood of calves and he-goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and also the book, and he sprinkled all the people,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Saying, This the blood of the covenant which God enjoined to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And also the tent, and all the vessels of the service, he poured all over likewise with blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And almost all things are purified according to the law with blood; and without blood-letting there is no remission.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Therefore truly a necessity for the patterns of things in the heavens to be purified with these; and the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For Christ came not into the holy places made with hands, the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to be shown clearly to the face of God for us:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Neither that he should offer himself many times, as the chief priest comes in to the holy places yearly with blood pertaining to others;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">(Since he must have suffered many times from the foundation of the world:) but now once at the termination of the times for the annulling of sin by the sacrifice of himself has he been shown clearly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And inasmuch as it is reserved to men once to die, and after this the judgment:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">So Christ, once offered to have borne the sins of many, of the second time, without sin, shall be seen to them expecting him for salvation.</p>
