<p class="verse" data-verse="1">To boast, really, is not profitable for me, for I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I have known a man in Christ, fourteen years ago—whether in the body I have not known, whether out of the body I have not known, God hath known—such an one being caught away unto the third heaven;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and I have known such a man—whether in the body, whether out of the body, I have not known, God hath known,—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">that he was caught away to the paradise, and heard unutterable sayings, that it is not possible for man to speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Of such an one I will boast, and of myself I will not boast, except in my infirmities,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">for if I may wish to boast, I shall not be a fool, for truth I will say; but I forebear, lest any one in regard to me may think anything above what he doth see me, or doth hear anything of me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and that by the exceeding greatness of the revelations I might not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of the Adversary, that he might buffet me, that I might not be exalted overmuch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Concerning this thing thrice the Lord did I call upon, that it might depart from me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and He said to me, ‘Sufficient for thee is My grace, for My power in infirmity is perfected;’ most gladly, therefore, will I rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of the Christ may rest on me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">wherefore I am well pleased in infirmities, in damages, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses—for Christ; for whenever I am infirm, then I am powerful;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I have become a fool—boasting; ye—ye did compel me; for I ought by you to have been commended, for in nothing was I behind the very chiefest apostles—even if I am nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The signs, indeed, of the apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">for what is there in which ye were inferior to the rest of the assemblies, except that I myself was not a burden to you? forgive me this injustice!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Lo, a third time I am ready to come unto you, and I will not be a burden to you, for I seek not yours, but you, for the children ought not for the parents to lay up, but the parents for the children,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and I most gladly will spend and be entirely spent for your souls, even if, more abundantly loving you, less I am loved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And be it so, I—I did not burden you, but being crafty, with guile I did take you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">any one of those whom I have sent unto you—by him did I take advantage of you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I entreated Titus, and did send with him the brother; did Titus take advantage of you? in the same spirit did we not walk?—did we not in the same steps?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Again, think ye that to you we are making defence? before God in Christ do we speak; and the all things, beloved, are for your up-building,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">for I fear lest, having come, not such as I wish I may find you, and I—I may be found by you such as ye do not wish, lest there be strifes, envyings, wraths, revelries, evil-speakings, whisperings, puffings up, insurrections,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">lest again having come, my God may humble me in regard to you, and I may bewail many of those having sinned before, and not having reformed concerning the uncleanness, and whoredom, and lasciviousness, that they did practise.</p>
