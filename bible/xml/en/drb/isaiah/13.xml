  <verse number="1">THE burden of Babylon, which Isaias the son of Amos saw.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Upon the dark mountain lift ye up a banner, exalt the voice, lift up the hand, and let the rulers go into the gates.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I have commanded my sanctified ones, and have called my strong ones in my wrath, them that rejoice in my glory.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The noise of a multitude in the mountains, as it were of many people, the noise of the sound of kings, of nations gathered together: the Lord of hosts hath given charge to the troops of war.</verse>
  <verse number="5">To them that come from a country afar off, from the end of heaven: tile Lord and the instruments of his wrath, to destroy the whole land.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Howl ye, for the day of the Lord is near: it shall come as a destruction from the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every heart of man shall melt,</verse>
  <verse number="8">And shall be broken. Gripings and pains shall take hold of them, they shall be in pain as a woman in labour. Every one shall be amazed at his neighbour, their countenances shall be as faces burnt.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Behold, the day of the Lord shall come, a cruel day, and full of indignation, and of wrath, and fury, to lay the land desolate, and to destroy the sinners thereof out of it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For the stars of heaven, and their brightness shall not display their light: the sun shall be darkened in his rising, and the moon shall not shine with her light.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And I will visit the evils of the world, and against the wicked for their iniquity: and I will make the pride of infidels to cease, and will bring down the arrogancy of the mighty.</verse>
  <verse number="12">A man shall be more precious than gold, yea a man than the finest of gold.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For this I will trouble the heaven: and the earth shall be moved out of her place, for the indignation of the Lord of hosts, and for the day of his tierce wrath.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And they shall be as a doe fleeing away, and as a sheep: and there shall be none to gather them together: every man shall turn to his own people, and every one shall flee to his own land.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Every one that shall be found, shall be slain: and every one that shall come to their aid, shall fall by the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Their infants shall be dashed in pieces before their eyes: their houses shall be pillaged, and their wives shall be ravished.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Behold I will stir up the Medes against them, who shall not seek silver, nor desire gold:</verse>
  <verse number="18">But with their arrows they shall kill the children, and shall have no pity upon the sucklings of the womb, and their eye shall not spare their sons.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And that Babylon, glorious among kingdoms, the famous pride of the Chaldeans, shall be even as the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha.</verse>
  <verse number="20">It shall no more be inhabited for ever, and it shall not be founded unto generation and generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch his tents there, nor shall shepherds rest there.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But wild beasts shall rest there, and their houses shall be filled with serpents, and ostriches shall dwell there, and the hairy ones shall dance there:</verse>
  <verse number="22">And owls shall answer one another there, in the houses thereof, and sirens in the temples of pleasure.</verse>
