  <verse number="1">And the word of the Lord came to me, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Son of man, what can be made from the stalk of a vine, compared to all the plants of the woods that are among the trees of the forests?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Can any wood be taken from it, so that it may be made into a work, or formed into a peg so as to hang some kind of vessel upon it?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Behold, it is used in the fire as fuel. The fire consumes both its ends; and its middle is reduced to ashes. So how can it be useful for any work?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Even when it was whole, it was unsuitable for a work. How much more so, when fire has devoured it and burned it up, will nothing of it be useful?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Therefore, thus says the Lord God: Like the stalk of the vine among the trees of the forests, which I have given to be devoured by fire, so will I deliver the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And I will set my face against them. They will go away from fire, and yet fire will consume them. And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I will have set my face against them,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and when I will have made their land impassable and desolate. For they have stood forth as transgressors, says the Lord God.”</verse>
