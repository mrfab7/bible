  <verse number="1">And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bore not.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold now, you are barren, and bore not: but you shall conceive, and bear a son.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Now therefore beware, I pray you, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:</verse>
  <verse number="5">For, see, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not from where he was, neither told he me his name:</verse>
  <verse number="7">But he said to me, Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then Manoah entreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man of God which you did send come again to us, and teach us what we shall do to the child that shall be born.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her husband was not with her.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the woman made haste, and ran, and showed her husband, and said to him, Behold, the man has appeared to me, that came to me the other day.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Are you the man that spoke to the woman? And he said, I am.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Manoah said, Now let your words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do to him?</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Of all that I said to the woman let her beware.</verse>
  <verse number="14">She may not eat of any thing that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, I pray you, let us detain you, until we shall have made ready a kid for you.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the angel of the LORD said to Manoah, Though you detain me, I will not eat of your bread: and if you will offer a burnt offering, you must offer it to the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, What is your name, that when your sayings come to pass we may do you honor?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the angel of the LORD said to him, Why ask you thus after my name, seeing it is secret?</verse>
  <verse number="19">So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it on a rock to the LORD: and the angel did wondrously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But his wife said to him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.</verse>
