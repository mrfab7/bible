<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And they brought in the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And when David had made an end of offering the burnt-offering and the peace-offerings, he blessed the people in the name of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a portion of flesh, and a cake of raisins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of Jehovah, and to celebrate and to thank and praise Jehovah, the God of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Asaph the chief, and second to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, with psalteries and with harps; and Asaph with cymbals, sounding aloud;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually, before the ark of the covenant of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Then on that day did David first ordain to give thanks unto Jehovah, by the hand of Asaph and his brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">O give thanks unto Jehovah, call upon his name; Make known his doings among the peoples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Sing unto him, sing praises unto him; Talk ye of all his marvellous works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Glory ye in his holy name; Let the heart of them rejoice that seek Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Seek ye Jehovah and his strength; Seek his face evermore.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, His wonders, and the judgments of his mouth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">O ye seed of Israel his servant, Ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He is Jehovah our God; His judgments are in all the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Remember his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The covenant which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">When ye were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And they went about from nation to nation, And from one kingdom to another people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Saying, Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Sing unto Jehovah, all the earth; Show forth his salvation from day to day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Declare his glory among the nations, His marvellous works among all the peoples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For great is Jehovah, and greatly to be praised: He also is to be feared above all gods.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For all the gods of the peoples are idols: But Jehovah made the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Honor and majesty are before him: Strength and gladness are in his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Ascribe unto Jehovah, ye kindreds of the peoples, Ascribe unto Jehovah glory and strength;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Ascribe unto Jehovah the glory due unto his name: Bring an offering, and come before him; Worship Jehovah in holy array.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Tremble before him, all the earth: The world also is established that it cannot be moved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; And let them say among the nations, Jehovah reigneth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; Let the field exult, and all that is therein;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Then shall the trees of the wood sing for joy before Jehovah; For he cometh to judge the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">O give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness endureth for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, And gather us together and deliver us from the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and praised Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">So he left there, before the ark of the covenant of Jehovah, Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark continually, as every dayâ€™s work required;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">and Obed-edom with their brethren, threescore and eight; Obed-edom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be doorkeepers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">and Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the tabernacle of Jehovah in the high place that was at Gibeon,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">to offer burnt-offerings unto Jehovah upon the altar of burnt-offering continually morning and evening, even according to all that is written in the law of Jehovah, which he commanded unto Israel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">and with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were chosen, who were mentioned by name, to give thanks to Jehovah, because his lovingkindness endureth for ever;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">and with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for those that should sound aloud, and with instruments for the songs of God; and the sons of Jeduthun to be at the gate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.</p>
