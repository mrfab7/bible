1	Bel bent; Nebo bowed down; their images were for the beast and for the cattle: your gifts were carried; a lifting up to the weary.
2	They bowed down, they bent together; they were not able to deliver the burden and their soul went into captivity.
3	Hear to me, ye house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, being carried from the belly, being lifted up from the womb:
4	find even to old age I am he; and even to grayness I will bear; I made and I will lift up, and I will bear, and I will deliver.
5	To whom will ye liken me and make equal? and compare me and we shall be like?
6	Squandering gold out of the bag and they will weigh silver in the balance, they will hire a founder, and he will make it a god: they will fall down, they will also worship.
7	They will lift him up upon the shoulder, they will carry him, they will set him down in his place and he will stand; from his place he shall not depart: also he will cry out to him and he will not answer; he will not save him from his straits.
8	Remember this, shew yourselves men: turn back, ye transgressing, upon the heart.
9	Remember the former things from forever: for I am God and no god besides, and none like me.
10	Announcing the last part from the beginning, and from of old what was not done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my delight:
11	Calling a ravenous beast from the sunrising, from a land afar off a man of my counsel: also I spake, also I will bring it; I formed, also I will do it.
12	Hear to me, ye strong of heart, being far from justice.
13	I brought near my justice; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not delay: and I gave salvation in Zion for Israel my beauty.
