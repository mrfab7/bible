  <verse number="1">My son, if thou wilt receive my words, And lay up my commandments with thee;</verse>
  <verse number="2">So that thou make thine ear attend unto wisdom, And thy heart incline to discernment;</verse>
  <verse number="3">Yea, if thou call for understanding, And lift up thy voice for discernment;</verse>
  <verse number="4">If thou seek her as silver, And search for her as for hid treasures;</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, And find the knowledge of God.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For the LORD giveth wisdom, Out of His mouth cometh knowledge and discernment;</verse>
  <verse number="7">He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright, He is a shield to them that walk in integrity;</verse>
  <verse number="8">That He may guard the paths of justice, And preserve the way of His godly ones.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice, And equity, yea, every good path.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For wisdom shall enter into thy heart, And knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul;</verse>
  <verse number="11">Discretion shall watch over thee, Discernment shall guard thee;</verse>
  <verse number="12">To deliver thee from the way of evil, From the men that speak froward things;</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who leave the paths of uprightness, To walk in the ways of darkness;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Who rejoice to do evil, And delight in the frowardness of evil;</verse>
  <verse number="15">Who are crooked in their ways, And perverse in their paths;</verse>
  <verse number="16">To deliver thee from the strange woman, Even from the alien woman that maketh smooth her words;</verse>
  <verse number="17">That forsaketh the lord of her youth, And forgetteth the covenant of her God.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For her house sinketh down unto death, And her paths unto the shades;</verse>
  <verse number="19">None that go unto her return, Neither do they attain unto the paths of life;</verse>
  <verse number="20">That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, And keep the paths of the righteous.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For the upright shall dwell in the land, And the whole-hearted shall remain in it.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, And the faithless shall be plucked up out of it.</verse>
