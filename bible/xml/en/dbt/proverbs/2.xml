  <verse number="1">My son, if thou receivest my words, and layest up my commandments with thee,</verse>
  <verse number="2">so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom [and] thou apply thy heart to understanding;</verse>
  <verse number="3">yea, if thou criest after discernment [and] liftest up thy voice to understanding;</verse>
  <verse number="4">if thou seekest her as silver and searchest for her as for hidden treasures:</verse>
  <verse number="5">then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, and find the knowledge of God.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For Jehovah giveth wisdom; out of his mouth [come] knowledge and understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright; [he] is a shield to them that walk in integrity;</verse>
  <verse number="8">guarding the paths of just judgment and keeping the way of his godly ones.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity: every good path.</verse>
  <verse number="10">When wisdom entereth into thy heart and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul,</verse>
  <verse number="11">discretion shall keep thee, understanding shall preserve thee:</verse>
  <verse number="12">To deliver thee from the way of evil, from the man that speaketh froward things;</verse>
  <verse number="13">[from those] who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</verse>
  <verse number="14">who rejoice to do evil, [and] delight in the frowardness of evil;</verse>
  <verse number="15">whose paths are crooked, and who are perverted in their course:</verse>
  <verse number="16">To deliver thee from the strange woman, from the stranger who flattereth with her words;</verse>
  <verse number="17">who forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God;</verse>
  <verse number="18">—for her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead;</verse>
  <verse number="19">none that go unto her return again, neither do they attain to the paths of life:</verse>
  <verse number="20">that thou mayest walk in the way of the good, And keep the paths of the righteous.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it;</verse>
  <verse number="22">but the wicked shall be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful shall be plucked up out of it.</verse>
