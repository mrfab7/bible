<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Be not many teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive greater judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For we all often offend. If any one offend not in word, he [is] a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body too.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Behold, we put the bits in the mouths of the horses, that they may obey us, and we turn round their whole bodies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Behold also the ships, which are so great, and driven by violent winds, are turned about by a very small rudder, wherever the pleasure of the helmsman will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thus also the tongue is a little member, and boasts great things. See how little a fire, how large a wood it kindles!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and the tongue [is] fire, the world of unrighteousness; the tongue is set in our members, the defiler of the whole body, and which sets fire to the course of nature, and is set on fire of hell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For every species both of beasts and of birds, both of creeping things and of sea animals, is tamed and has been tamed by the human species;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">but the tongue can no one among men tame; [it is] an unsettled evil, full of death-bringing poison.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Therewith bless we the Lord and Father, and therewith curse we men made after [the] likeness of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Out of the same mouth goes forth blessing and cursing. It is not right, my brethren, that these things should be thus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Does the fountain, out of the same opening, pour forth sweet and bitter?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Can, my brethren, a fig produce olives, or a vine figs? Neither [can] salt [water] make sweet water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who [is] wise and understanding among you; let him shew out of a good conversation his works in meekness of wisdom;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">but if ye have bitter emulation and strife in your hearts, do not boast and lie against the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">This is not the wisdom which comes down from above, but earthly, natural, devilish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For where emulation and strife [are], there [is] disorder and every evil thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But the wisdom from above first is pure, then peaceful, gentle, yielding, full of mercy and good fruits, unquestioning, unfeigned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But [the] fruit of righteousness in peace is sown for them that make peace.</p>
