<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Therefore having left the word of the beginning of Christ, we should go on to perfection; not again laying down the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Of the teaching of immersions, and placing upon of hands, and of the rising up of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And this will we do, if God even permit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For impossible for them once enlightened, and having tasted of the heavenly gift, and having partaken of the Holy Spirit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And tasted of the good word of God, and powers of the life about to be,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And having fallen, again to renew to repentance; crucifying to themselves the Son of God, and exposing to ignominy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For the earth drinking the rain coming often upon it, and bringing forth the vegetable fitting well to them by whom it is cultivated, receives commendation from God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And producing thorns and briers is rejected, after having been tried, and near cursing; whose end for destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And we have been persuaded of you, dearly beloved, of better things, and connected with salvation, if we also thus speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For God is not unjust to forget your work and fatigue of love, which ye showed to his name, having served to the holy ones, and serving.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And we desire each of you to show the same earnestness to the complete certainty of hope to the end:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">That ye be not sluggish, but imitators of them inheriting the promises by faith and longsuffering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For God promising to Abraham, since he had none greater to swear by, sware by himself,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Saying, Truly will I praise thee, and multiplying will I multiply thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And so, having endured long, he gained the promise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For truly men swear by the greater: and the oath for confirmation to them the end of all controversy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">In which God, willing more abundantly to show to the heirs of the promise the firmness of his counsel, he intervened by an oath:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">That by two unalterable deeds, in which it is impossible for God to deceive we might have a strong consolation, taking refuge in holding firmly the hope set before:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Which we have as an anchor of the soul, unshaken and firm, and entering into that further within the veil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Where the forerunner, Jesus, went in for us, according to the order of Melchisedec, being a high priest forever.</p>
