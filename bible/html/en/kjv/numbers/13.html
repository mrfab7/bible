<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men [were] heads of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And these [were] their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Of the tribe of Joseph, [namely], of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">These [are] the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them, Get you up this [way] southward, and go up into the mountain:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And see the land, what it [is]; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether they [be] strong or weak, few or many;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And what the land [is] that they dwell in, whether it [be] good or bad; and what cities [they be] that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And what the land [is], whether it [be] fat or lean, whether there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time [was] the time of the firstripe grapes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, [were]. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and [they brought] of the pomegranates, and of the figs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this [is] the fruit of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Nevertheless the people [be] strong that dwell in the land, and the cities [are] walled, [and] very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up against the people; for they [are] stronger than we.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone to search it, [is] a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in it [are] men of a great stature.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, [which come] of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.</p>
