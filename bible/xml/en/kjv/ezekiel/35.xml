<chapter book="Ezekiel" number="35" translation="King James Bible" translationID="kjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,</verse>
  <verse number="3">And say unto it, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I [am] against thee, and I will stretch out mine hand against thee, and I will make thee most desolate.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Because thou hast had a perpetual hatred, and hast shed [the blood of] the children of Israel by the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the time [that their] iniquity [had] an end:</verse>
  <verse number="6">Therefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: sith thou hast not hated blood, even blood shall pursue thee.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thus will I make mount Seir most desolate, and cut off from it him that passeth out and him that returneth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And I will fill his mountains with his slain [men]: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, shall they fall that are slain with the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall not return: and ye shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas the LORD was there:</verse>
  <verse number="11">Therefore, [as] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine anger, and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy hatred against them; and I will make myself known among them, when I have judged thee.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And thou shalt know that I [am] the LORD, [and that] I have heard all thy blasphemies which thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying, They are laid desolate, they are given us to consume.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me, and have multiplied your words against me: I have heard [them].</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thus saith the Lord GOD; When the whole earth rejoiceth, I will make thee desolate.</verse>
  <verse number="15">As thou didst rejoice at the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee: thou shalt be desolate, O mount Seir, and all Idumea, [even] all of it: and they shall know that I [am] the LORD.</verse>
