<p class="verse" data-verse="1">If a man shall steal an ox, or a sheep, and kill it, or sell it; he shall restore five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">If a thief be found breaking up, and be smitten that he die, [there shall] no blood [be shed] for him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If the sun be risen upon him, [there shall be] blood [shed] for him; [for] he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If the theft be certainly found in his hand alive, whether it be ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man’s field; of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard, shall he make restitution.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If fire break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field, be consumed [therewith]; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it be stolen out of the man’s house; if the thief be found, let him pay double.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges, [to see] whether he have put his hand unto his neighbour’s goods.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For all manner of trespass, [whether it be] for ox, for ass, for sheep, for raiment, [or] for any manner of lost thing, which [another] challengeth to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; [and] whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If a man deliver unto his neighbour an ass, or an ox, or a sheep, or any beast, to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man seeing [it]:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">[Then] shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he hath not put his hand unto his neighbour’s goods; and the owner of it shall accept [thereof], and he shall not make [it] good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And if it be stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If it be torn in pieces, [then] let him bring it [for] witness, [and] he shall not make good that which was torn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And if a man borrow [ought] of his neighbour, and it be hurt, or die, the owner thereof [being] not with it, he shall surely make [it] good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">[But] if the owner thereof [be] with it, he shall not make [it] good: if it [be] an hired [thing], it came for his hire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And if a man entice a maid that is not betrothed, and lie with her, he shall surely endow her to be his wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If her father utterly refuse to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Whosoever lieth with a beast shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He that sacrificeth unto [any] god, save unto the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If thou afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If thou lend money to [any of] my people [that is] poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as an usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">If thou at all take thy neighbour’s raiment to pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him by that the sun goeth down:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For that [is] his covering only, it [is] his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth unto me, that I will hear; for I [am] gracious.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Thou shalt not delay [to offer] the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen, [and] with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And ye shall be holy men unto me: neither shall ye eat [any] flesh [that is] torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.</p>
