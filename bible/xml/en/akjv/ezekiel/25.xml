  <verse number="1">The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;</verse>
  <verse number="3">And say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus said the Lord GOD; Because you said, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;</verse>
  <verse number="4">Behold, therefore I will deliver you to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in you, and make their dwellings in you: they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couching place for flocks: and you shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For thus said the Lord GOD; Because you have clapped your hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all your despite against the land of Israel;</verse>
  <verse number="7">Behold, therefore I will stretch out my hand on you, and will deliver you for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut you off from the people, and I will cause you to perish out of the countries: I will destroy you; and you shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thus said the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like to all the heathen;</verse>
  <verse number="9">Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Bethjeshimoth, Baalmeon, and Kiriathaim,</verse>
  <verse number="10">To the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And I will execute judgments on Moab; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Thus said the Lord GOD; Because that Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended, and revenged himself on them;</verse>
  <verse number="13">Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out my hand on Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And I will lay my vengeance on Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, said the Lord GOD.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thus said the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it for the old hatred;</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out my hand on the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And I will execute great vengeance on them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance on them.</verse>
