<chapter book="Isaiah" number="55" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Ho, every one that thirsts, come you to the waters, and he that has no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Why do you spend money for that which is not bread? and your labor for that which satisfies not? listen diligently to me, and eat you that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Incline your ear, and come to me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader and commander to the people.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Behold, you shall call a nation that you know not, and nations that knew not you shall run to you because of the LORD your God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he has glorified you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Seek you the LORD while he may be found, call you on him while he is near:</verse>
  <verse number="7">Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return to the LORD, and he will have mercy on him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, said the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and returns not thither, but waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread to the eater:</verse>
  <verse number="11">So shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth: it shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For you shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.</verse>
