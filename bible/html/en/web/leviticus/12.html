<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘If a woman conceives, and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean seven days; as in the days of her monthly period she shall be unclean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">In the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">She shall continue in the blood of purification thirty-three days. She shall not touch any holy thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying are completed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her period; and she shall continue in the blood of purification sixty-six days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">“‘When the days of her purification are completed, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the door of the Tent of Meeting, a year old lamb for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and he shall offer it before Yahweh, and make atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood. “‘This is the law for her who bears, whether a male or a female.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">If she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves, or two young pigeons; the one for a burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be clean.’”</p>
