<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: [so doth] a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom [and] honour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A wise man’s heart [is] at his right hand; but a fool’s heart at his left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth [him], and he saith to every one [that] he [is] a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">There is an evil [which] I have seen under the sun, as an error [which] proceedeth from the ruler:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; [and] he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom [is] profitable to direct.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The words of a wise man’s mouth [are] gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The beginning of the words of his mouth [is] foolishness: and the end of his talk [is] mischievous madness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Woe to thee, O land, when thy king [is] a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Blessed [art] thou, O land, when thy king [is] the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all [things].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.</p>
