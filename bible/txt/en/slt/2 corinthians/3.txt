1	Begin we again to recommend ourselves or need we not, as some; recommendatory epistles to you, or recommendatory from you?
2	Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and acknowledged by all men:
3	Made manifest that ye are the epistle of Christ served by us, not written with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables made of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart.
4	And we have such confidence through Christ to God:
5	Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to reckon anything as of ourselves; but our sufficiency of God;
6	Who rendered as fitting servants of the new covenant; not of the letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter kills, and the Spirit makes alive.
7	And if the service of death, in letters imprinted in stones, was in glory, so that the sons of Israel could not look intently to the face of Moses for the glory of his face; being left unemployed.
8	How shall not rather the service of the Spirit be in glory?
9	For if the service of condemnation glory, much more the service of justice abounds in glory.
10	For also that having been glorified has not been glorified in this part, for sake of the glory excelling.
11	For if that left unemployed by glory, much more that remaining in glory.
12	Therefore having such hope, we use much freedom of speech:
13	And not as Moses put a veil upon his face, that the sons of Israel should not look intently to the end of that left unemployed:
14	But their minds were hardened: for until this day the same veil upon the reading of the old covenant remains not uncovered; for in Christ it is left unemployed.
15	But even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies upon their heart.
16	And whenever it turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.
17	And the Lord is the Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord, there freedom.
18	And we all, shown as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, with the face uncovered, are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as from the Spirit of the Lord.
