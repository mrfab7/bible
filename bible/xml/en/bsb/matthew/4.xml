  <verse number="1">Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
  <verse number="2">After fasting forty days and forty nights, He was hungry.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The tempter came to Him and said, “If You are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">But Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’”</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then the devil took Him to the holy city and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple.</verse>
  <verse number="6">“If You are the Son of God,” he said, “throw Yourself down. For it is written: ‘He will command His angels concerning You, and they will lift You up in their hands, so that You will not strike Your foot against a stone.’”</verse>
  <verse number="7">Jesus replied, “It is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your God to the test.’”</verse>
  <verse number="8">Again, the devil took Him to a very high mountain and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.</verse>
  <verse number="9">“All this I will give You,” he said, “if You will fall down and worship me.”</verse>
  <verse number="10">“Away from Me, Satan!” Jesus told him. “For it is written: ‘Worship the Lord your God and serve Him only.’”</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then the devil left Him, and angels came and ministered to Him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">When Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, He withdrew to Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Leaving Nazareth, He went and lived in Capernaum, which is by the sea in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
  <verse number="14">to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:</verse>
  <verse number="15">“Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, the Way of the Sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles—</verse>
  <verse number="16">the people living in darkness have seen a great light; on those living in the land of the shadow of death, a light has dawned.”</verse>
  <verse number="17">From that time on Jesus began to preach, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.”</verse>
  <verse number="18">As Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.</verse>
  <verse number="19">“Come, follow Me,” Jesus said, “and I will make you fishers of men.”</verse>
  <verse number="20">And at once they left their nets and followed Him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Going on from there, He saw two other brothers, James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus called them,</verse>
  <verse number="22">and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed Him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people.</verse>
  <verse number="24">News about Him spread all over Syria, and people brought to Him all who were ill with various diseases, those suffering acute pain, the demon-possessed, those having seizures, and the paralyzed, and He healed them.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Large crowds followed Him, having come from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</verse>
