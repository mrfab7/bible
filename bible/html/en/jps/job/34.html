<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="34" data-translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" data-translation-id="jps" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover Elihu answered and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear my words, ye wise men; And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the ear trieth words, As the palate tasteth food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Let us choose for us that which is right; Let us know among ourselves what is good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For Job hath said: ‘I am righteous, And God hath taken away my right;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Notwithstanding my right I am accounted a liar; My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">What man is like Job, Who drinketh up scorning like water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, And walketh with wicked men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For he hath said: ‘It profiteth a man nothing That he should be in accord with God.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: Far be it from God, that He should do wickedness; And from the Almighty, that He should commit iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the work of a man will He requite unto him, And cause every man to find according to his ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly, Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who gave Him a charge over the earth? Or who hath disposed the whole world?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If He set His heart upon man, If He gather unto Himself his spirit and his breath;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All flesh shall perish together, And man shall return unto dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If now thou hast understanding, hear this; Hearken to the voice of my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Shall even one that hateth right govern? And wilt thou condemn Him that is just and mighty—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Is it fit to say to a king: ‘Thou art base’? Or to nobles: ‘Ye are wicked’?—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">That respecteth not the persons of princes, Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? For they all are the work of His hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In a moment they die, even at midnight; The people are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For His eyes are upon the ways of a man, And He seeth all his goings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For He doth not appoint a time unto any man, When he should go before God in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He breaketh in pieces mighty men without inquisition, And setteth others in their stead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Therefore He taketh knowledge of their works; And He overturneth them in the night, so that they are crushed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He striketh them as wicked men In the open sight of others;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Because they turned aside from following Him, And would not have regard to any of His ways;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto Him, And He heareth the cry of the afflicted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">When He giveth quietness, who then can condemn? And when He hideth His face, who then can behold Him? Whether it be done unto a nation, or unto a man, alike;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">That the godless man reign not, That there be none to ensnare the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For hath any said unto God: ‘I have borne chastisement, though I offend not;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">That which I see not teach Thou me; If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Shall His recompense be as thou wilt? For thou loathest it, So that thou must choose, and not I; Therefore speak what thou knowest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Men of understanding will say unto me, Yea, every wise man that heareth me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Job speaketh without knowledge, And his words are without discernment.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Would that Job were tried unto the end, Because of his answering like wicked men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, He clappeth his hands among us, And multiplieth his words against God.</p>
