<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, Mine ear hath heard and understood it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Surely I would speak to the Almighty, And I desire to reason with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But ye are forgers of lies; Ye are all physicians of no value.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! And it would be your wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Hear now my reasoning, And hearken to the pleadings of my lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Will ye speak unrighteously for God, And talk deceitfully for him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Will ye show partiality to him? Will ye contend for God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Is it good that he should search you out? Or as one deceiveth a man, will ye deceive him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He will surely reprove you, If ye do secretly show partiality.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Shall not his majesty make you afraid, And his dread fall upon you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, Your defences are defences of clay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak; And let come on me what will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Wherefore should I take my flesh in my teeth, And put my life in my hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold, he will slay me; I have no hope: Nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">This also shall be my salvation, That a godless man shall not come before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Hear diligently my speech, And let my declaration be in your ears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Behold now, I have set my cause in order; I know that I am righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Who is he that will contend with me? For then would I hold my peace and give up the ghost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Only do not two things unto me; Then will I not hide myself from thy face:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Withdraw thy hand far from me; And let not thy terror make me afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Then call thou, and I will answer; Or let me speak, and answer thou me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">How many are mine iniquities and sins? Make me to know my transgression and my sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Wherefore hidest thou thy face, And holdest me for thine enemy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Wilt thou harass a driven leaf? And wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For thou writest bitter things against me, And makest me to inherit the iniquities of my youth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, And markest all my paths; Thou settest a bound to the soles of my feet:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Though I am like a rotten thing that consumeth, Like a garment that is moth-eaten.</p>
