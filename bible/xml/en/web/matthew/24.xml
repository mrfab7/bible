  <verse number="1">Jesus went out from the temple, and was going on his way. His disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.</verse>
  <verse number="2">But he answered them, “You see all of these things, don’t you? Most certainly I tell you, there will not be left here one stone on another, that will not be thrown down.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be? What is the sign of your coming, and of the end of the age?”</verse>
  <verse number="4">Jesus answered them, “Be careful that no one leads you astray.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and will lead many astray.</verse>
  <verse number="6">You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you aren’t troubled, for all this must happen, but the end is not yet.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; and there will be famines, plagues, and earthquakes in various places.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But all these things are the beginning of birth pains.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then they will deliver you up to oppression, and will kill you. You will be hated by all of the nations for my name’s sake.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then many will stumble, and will deliver up one another, and will hate one another.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Many false prophets will arise, and will lead many astray.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Because iniquity will be multiplied, the love of many will grow cold.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But he who endures to the end, the same will be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="14">This Good News of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.</verse>
  <verse number="15">“When, therefore, you see the abomination of desolation, which was spoken of through Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand),</verse>
  <verse number="16">then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take out things that are in his house.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Let him who is in the field not return back to get his clothes.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But woe to those who are with child and to nursing mothers in those days!</verse>
  <verse number="20">Pray that your flight will not be in the winter, nor on a Sabbath,</verse>
  <verse number="21">for then there will be great oppression, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever will be.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Unless those days had been shortened, no flesh would have been saved. But for the sake of the chosen ones, those days will be shortened.</verse>
  <verse number="23">“Then if any man tells you, ‘Behold, here is the Christ,’ or, ‘There,’ don’t believe it.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For there will arise false christs, and false prophets, and they will show great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen ones.</verse>
  <verse number="25">“Behold, I have told you beforehand.</verse>
  <verse number="26">If therefore they tell you, ‘Behold, he is in the wilderness,’ don’t go out; ‘Behold, he is in the inner rooms,’ don’t believe it.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For as the lightning flashes from the east, and is seen even to the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.</verse>
  <verse number="28">For wherever the carcass is, there is where the vultures gather together.</verse>
  <verse number="29">But immediately after the oppression of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken;</verse>
  <verse number="30">and then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky. Then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory.</verse>
  <verse number="31">He will send out his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together his chosen ones from the four winds, from one end of the sky to the other.</verse>
  <verse number="32">“Now from the fig tree learn this parable. When its branch has now become tender, and puts forth its leaves, you know that the summer is near.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Even so you also, when you see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Most certainly I tell you, this generation will not pass away, until all these things are accomplished.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.</verse>
  <verse number="36">But no one knows of that day and hour, not even the angels of heaven, but my Father only.</verse>
  <verse number="37">“As the days of Noah were, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.</verse>
  <verse number="38">For as in those days which were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ship,</verse>
  <verse number="39">and they didn’t know until the flood came, and took them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.</verse>
  <verse number="40">Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and one will be left;</verse>
  <verse number="41">two women grinding at the mill, one will be taken and one will be left.</verse>
  <verse number="42">Watch therefore, for you don’t know in what hour your Lord comes.</verse>
  <verse number="43">But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Therefore also be ready, for in an hour that you don’t expect, the Son of Man will come.</verse>
  <verse number="45">“Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has set over his household, to give them their food in due season?</verse>
  <verse number="46">Blessed is that servant whom his lord finds doing so when he comes.</verse>
  <verse number="47">Most certainly I tell you that he will set him over all that he has.</verse>
  <verse number="48">But if that evil servant should say in his heart, ‘My lord is delaying his coming,’</verse>
  <verse number="49">and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eat and drink with the drunkards,</verse>
  <verse number="50">the lord of that servant will come in a day when he doesn’t expect it, and in an hour when he doesn’t know it,</verse>
  <verse number="51">and will cut him in pieces, and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. There is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.</verse>
