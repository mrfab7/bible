<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But the Lord, responding to Job from a whirlwind, said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Who is this that wraps sentences in unskilled words?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Gird your waist like a man. I will question you, and you must answer me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Where were you, when I set the foundations of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who set its measurements, if you know, or who stretched a line over it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Upon what have its bases been grounded, and who set forth its cornerstone,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">when the morning stars praised me together, and all the sons of God made a joyful noise?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Who enclosed the sea with doors, when it broke forth as if issuing from the womb,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">when I stationed a cloud as its garment and wrapped it in a mist as if swaddling an infant?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I encircled it with my limits, and I positioned its bars and doors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And I said: “This far you will approach, and you will proceeded no further, and here you will break your swelling waves.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Did you, after your birth, command the birth of the sun and show the sunrise its place?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And did you hold the extremities of the earth, shaking them, and have you shaken the impious out of it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The seal will be restored like clay, and it will remain in place like a garment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">From the impious, the light will be taken away, and the exalted arm will be broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Have you entered the depths of the sea, and have you taken a walk in the uttermost parts of the abyss?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Have the gates of death been opened to you, and have you seen the doors of darkness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Have you considered the breadth of the earth? If you know all things, reveal them to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Which is the way that holds the light, and which is the place of darkness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In this way, you might lead each thing to its final place, and understand the paths of its house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">So then, did you know when you were to be born? And did you know the number of your days?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Have you been admitted into the storehouses of the snows, and have you gazed upon the stockpile of the brimstone,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">which I have prepared for the time of the enemy, for the day of the battle and the war?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">In what way is the light scattered, and the heat distributed, over the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Who gave a course to the rainstorms, and a path to the resounding thunder,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">so that it would rain on the earth far from man, in the wilderness where no mortal lingers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">so that it would fill impassable and desolate places, and would bring forth green plants?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Who is the father of rain, or who conceived the drops of dew?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">From whose womb did the ice proceed, and who created the frost from the air?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The waters are hardened to become like stone, and the surface of the abyss freezes over.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Will you have the strength to join together the sparkling stars of the Pleiades, or are you able to disperse the circling of Arcturus?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Can you bring forth the morning star, in its time, and make the evening star rise over the sons of the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Do you know the order of heaven, and can you explain its rules here on the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, so that an onslaught of waters will cover you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Can you send forth lightning bolts, and will they go, and on returning, say to you: “Here we are?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Who placed discernment in the guts of man, or who gave the rooster intelligence?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Who can describe the rules of the heavens, or who can put to rest the harmony of heaven?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">When was the dust cast to become the earth, and when were its clods fastened together?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Will you seize prey for the lioness, and will you sustain the lives of her young,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">as they rest in their dens or lie in wait in pits?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Who provides the raven with its meal, when her chicks cry out to God, as they wander around because they have no food?</p>
