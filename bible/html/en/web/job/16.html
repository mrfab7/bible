<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“I have heard many such things. You are all miserable comforters!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Shall vain words have an end? Or what provokes you that you answer?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I also could speak as you do. If your soul were in my soul’s place, I could join words together against you, and shake my head at you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">but I would strengthen you with my mouth. The solace of my lips would relieve you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">“Though I speak, my grief is not subsided. Though I forbear, what am I eased?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But now, God, you have surely worn me out. You have made desolate all my company.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">You have shriveled me up. This is a witness against me. My leanness rises up against me. It testifies to my face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He has torn me in his wrath, and persecuted me. He has gnashed on me with his teeth. My adversary sharpens his eyes on me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They have gaped on me with their mouth. They have struck me on the cheek reproachfully. They gather themselves together against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">God delivers me to the ungodly, and casts me into the hands of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I was at ease, and he broke me apart. Yes, he has taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces. He has also set me up for his target.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">His archers surround me. He splits my kidneys apart, and does not spare. He pours out my gall on the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He breaks me with breach on breach. He runs on me like a giant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I have sewed sackcloth on my skin, and have thrust my horn in the dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">My face is red with weeping. Deep darkness is on my eyelids.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Although there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">“Earth, don’t cover my blood. Let my cry have no place to rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven. He who vouches for me is on high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My friends scoff at me. My eyes pour out tears to God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">that he would maintain the right of a man with God, of a son of man with his neighbor!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For when a few years have come, I shall go the way of no return.</p>
