<chapter book="Ephesians" number="5" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Be ye therefore imitators of God, as beloved children,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and walk in love, even as the Christ loved us, and delivered himself up for us, an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling savour.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But fornication and all uncleanness or unbridled lust, let it not be even named among you, as it becomes saints;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and filthiness and foolish talking, or jesting, which are not convenient; but rather thanksgiving.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For this ye are [well] informed of, knowing that no fornicator, or unclean person, or person of unbridled lust, who is an idolater, has inheritance in the kingdom of the Christ and God.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Let no one deceive you with vain words, for on account of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Be not ye therefore fellow-partakers with them;</verse>
  <verse number="8">for ye were once darkness, but now light in [the] Lord; walk as children of light,</verse>
  <verse number="9">(for the fruit of the light [is] in all goodness and righteousness and truth,)</verse>
  <verse number="10">proving what is agreeable to the Lord;</verse>
  <verse number="11">and do not have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather also reprove [them],</verse>
  <verse number="12">for the things that are done by them in secret it is shameful even to say.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But all things having their true character exposed by the light are made manifest; for that which makes everything manifest is light.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Wherefore he says, Wake up, [thou] that sleepest, and arise up from among the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee.</verse>
  <verse number="15">See therefore how ye walk carefully, not as unwise but as wise,</verse>
  <verse number="16">redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For this reason be not foolish, but understanding what [is] the will of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And be not drunk with wine, in which is debauchery; but be filled with the Spirit,</verse>
  <verse number="19">speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and chanting with your heart to the Lord;</verse>
  <verse number="20">giving thanks at all times for all things to him [who is] God and [the] Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
  <verse number="21">submitting yourselves to one another in [the] fear of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Wives, [submit yourselves] to your own husbands, as to the Lord,</verse>
  <verse number="23">for a husband is head of the wife, as also the Christ [is] head of the assembly. He [is] Saviour of the body.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But even as the assembly is subjected to the Christ, so also wives to their own husbands in everything.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Husbands, love your own wives, even as the Christ also loved the assembly, and has delivered himself up for it,</verse>
  <verse number="26">in order that he might sanctify it, purifying [it] by the washing of water by [the] word,</verse>
  <verse number="27">that he might present the assembly to himself glorious, having no spot, or wrinkle, or any of such things; but that it might be holy and blameless.</verse>
  <verse number="28">So ought men also to love their own wives as their own bodies: he that loves his own wife loves himself.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For no one has ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, even as also the Christ the assembly:</verse>
  <verse number="30">for we are members of his body; [we are of his flesh, and of his bones.]</verse>
  <verse number="31">Because of this a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall be united to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="32">This mystery is great, but I speak as to Christ, and as to the assembly.</verse>
  <verse number="33">But ye also, every one of you, let each so love his own wife as himself; but as to the wife [I speak] that she may fear the husband.</verse>
