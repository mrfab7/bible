<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The first day of the week comes Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, to the sepulcher, and sees the stone taken away from the sepulcher.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Then she runs, and comes to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken away the LORD out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulcher.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulcher.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet went he not in.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then comes Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulcher, and sees the linen clothes lie,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulcher, and he saw, and believed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then the disciples went away again to their own home.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But Mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping: and as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulcher,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And sees two angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And they say to her, Woman, why weep you? She said to them, Because they have taken away my LORD, and I know not where they have laid him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Jesus said to her, Woman, why weep you? whom seek you? She, supposing him to be the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have borne him hence, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Jesus said to her, Mary. She turned herself, and said to him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Jesus said to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the LORD, and that he had spoken these things to her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And when he had so said, he showed to them his hands and his side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be to you: as my Father has sent me, even so send I you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive you the Holy Ghost:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Whose soever sins you remit, they are remitted to them; and whose soever sins you retain, they are retained.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the LORD. But he said to them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and stood in the middle, and said, Peace be to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Then said he to Thomas, Reach here your finger, and behold my hands; and reach here your hand, and thrust it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And Thomas answered and said to him, My LORD and my God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Jesus said to him, Thomas, because you have seen me, you have believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But these are written, that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing you might have life through his name.</p>
