  <verse number="1">Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry to her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for she hath received from the LORD’S hand double for all her sins.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh together shall see it: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all its goodliness is as the flower of the field:</verse>
  <verse number="7">The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall shall stand forever.</verse>
  <verse number="9">O Zion, that bringest good tidings, go up upon the high mountain: O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say to the cities of Judah, Behold your God!</verse>
  <verse number="10">Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm will rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He will feed his flock like a shepherd: he will gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and will gently lead those that are with young.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and measured heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his counselor hath taught him?</verse>
  <verse number="14">With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and showed to him the way of understanding?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very little thing.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts of it sufficient for a burnt-offering.</verse>
  <verse number="17">All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to him less than nothing, and vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="18">To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare to him?</verse>
  <verse number="19">The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.</verse>
  <verse number="20">He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh for himself a skillful workman to prepare a graven image that shall not be moved.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the foundations of the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="22">It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in:</verse>
  <verse number="23">That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of the earth as vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Yes, they shall not be planted; yes, they shall not be sown: yes, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.</verse>
  <verse number="25">To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equaled? saith the Holy One.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names, by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one faileth.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over by my God?</verse>
  <verse number="28">Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="29">He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:</verse>
  <verse number="31">But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not faint.</verse>
