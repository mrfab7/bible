<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="5" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">For we have known that if our earthly house of the tabernacle may be thrown down, a building from God we have, an house not made with hands—age-during—in the heavens,</verse>
  <verse number="2">for also in this we groan, with our dwelling that is from heaven earnestly desiring to clothe ourselves,</verse>
  <verse number="3">if so be that, having clothed ourselves, we shall not be found naked,</verse>
  <verse number="4">for we also who are in the tabernacle do groan, being burdened, seeing we wish not to unclothe ourselves, but to clothe ourselves, that the mortal may be swallowed up of the life.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And He who did work us to this self-same thing is God, who also did give to us the earnest of the Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="6">having courage, then, at all times, and knowing that being at home in the body, we are away from home from the Lord,—</verse>
  <verse number="7">for through faith we walk, not through sight—</verse>
  <verse number="8">we have courage, and are well pleased rather to be away from the home of the body, and to be at home with the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Wherefore also we are ambitious, whether at home or away from home, to be well pleasing to him,</verse>
  <verse number="10">for all of us it behoveth to be manifested before the tribunal of the Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body, in reference to the things that he did, whether good or evil;</verse>
  <verse number="11">having known, therefore, the fear of the Lord, we persuade men, and to God we are manifested, and I hope also in your consciences to have been manifested;</verse>
  <verse number="12">for not again ourselves do we recommend to you, but we are giving occasion to you of glorifying in our behalf, that ye may have something in reference to those glorifying in face and not in heart;</verse>
  <verse number="13">for whether we were beside ourselves, it was to God; whether we be of sound mind—it is to you,</verse>
  <verse number="14">for the love of the Christ doth constrain us, having judged thus: that if one for all died, then the whole died,</verse>
  <verse number="15">and for all he died, that those living, no more to themselves may live, but to him who died for them, and was raised again.</verse>
  <verse number="16">So that we henceforth have known no one according to the flesh, and even if we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him no more;</verse>
  <verse number="17">so that if any one is in Christ—he is a new creature; the old things did pass away, lo, become new have the all things.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the all things are of God, who reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and did give to us the ministration of the reconciliation,</verse>
  <verse number="19">how that God was in Christ—a world reconciling to Himself, not reckoning to them their trespasses; and having put in us the word of the reconciliation,</verse>
  <verse number="20">in behalf of Christ, then, we are ambassadors, as if God were calling through us, we beseech, in behalf of Christ, ‘Be ye reconciled to God;’</verse>
  <verse number="21">for him who did not know sin, in our behalf He did make sin, that we may become the righteousness of God in him.</verse>
