<div class="chapter" data-book="Micah" data-chapter="3" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And I said: Hear, O ye princes of Jacob, and ye chiefs of the house of Israel: Is it not your part to know judgment,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">You that hate good, and love evil: that violently pluck off their skins from them, and their flesh from their bones?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Who have eaten the flesh of my people, and have flayed their skin from off them: and have broken, and chopped their bones as for the kettle, and as flesh in the midst of the pot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Then shall they cry to the Lord, and he will not hear them: and he will hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved wickedly in their devices.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thus saith the Lord concerning the prophets that make my people err: that bite with their teeth, and preach peace: and if a man give not something into their mouth, they prepare war against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Therefore night shall be to you instead of vision, and darkness to you instead of divination; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day shall be darkened over them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And they shall be confounded that see visions, and the diviners shall be confounded: and they shall all cover their faces, because there is no answer of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But yet I am filled with the strength of the spirit of the Lord, with judgment, and power: to declare unto Jacob his wickedness, and to Israel his sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Hear this, ye princes of the house of Jacob, and ye judges of the house of Israel: you that abhor judgment, and pervert all that is right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">You that build up Sion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Her princes have judged for bribes, and her priests have taught for hire, and her prophets divined for money: and they leaned upon the Lord, saying: Is not the Lord in the midst of us? no evil shall come upon us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Therefore, because of you, Sion shall be ploughed as a field, and Jerusalem shall be as a heap of stones, and the mountain of the temple as the high places of the forests.</p>
