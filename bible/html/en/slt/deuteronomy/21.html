<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When there shall be found a wounded in the land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee, to possess it, fallen in the field, not knowing who smote him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And thy old men and thy judges shall come forth and measure to the cities which are round about him wounded:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And it was the the city being near to the wounded, and the old men of the city took a heifer of the kine which was not worked with, and drew not in the yoke:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the old men of that city brought down the heifer to a perennial valley which shall not be worked in it, and shall not be sown, and they break there the neck of the heifer in the valley;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the priests, the sons of Levi, came near, for in them Jehovah thy God chose to serve him and to bless in the name of Jehovah, and by their mouth shall be every controversy and every blow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And all the old men of that city being near to him wounded, shall wash their hands over the heifer having her neck broken in the valley:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And they answered and said, Our hands poured not out this blood, and our eyes saw not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Expiate for thy people Israel whom thou didst redeem, O Jehovah, and thou shalt not give innocent blood in the midst of thy people Israel. And the blood was expiated to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And thou shalt put away innocent blood from the midst of thee when thou shall do the right in the eyes of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">When thou shalt go forth to war against thine enemy, and Jehovah thy God gave him into thine hand, and thou didst take him captive,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And thou sawest in the captivity a woman of beautiful form, and thou didst delight in her, and thou didst take her to thee for a wife;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And thou broughtest her to thy house, and she shaved her head and did her nails:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And she put away the garment of her captivity from off her, and she dwelt in thy house, and she wept for her father and her mother a month of days: and after that thou shalt go in to her, and thou wert her lord, and she was for wife to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And it was, if thou didst not delight in her, and thou sentest her away according to her soul; and selling, thou shalt not sell her for silver; and thou shalt not lay hands upon her because thou didst humble her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">When there shall be to a man two wives, the one loved and the one hated, and they bare sons to him, the loved and the hated, and the first-born son was to her being hated:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And it was in the day of his causing his sons to inherit what shall be to him, he shall, not be able to make the son of the loved first-born before the son of the hated, the first-born:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated, the first-born, to give to him the portion of two in all that shall be found to him; for he is the beginning of his strength; to him is the judgment of the first-born.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If there shall be to a man a son stubborn and rebellious, he not hearing to the voice of his father and to the voice of his mother, and they chastised him, and he will not hear to them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And his father and his mother laid hold on him and brought him to the old men of his city, and to the gate of his place;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And they said to the old men of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he heard not to our voice; he is vile, and drinking to excess.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And all the men of his city stoned him with stones, and he died: and put thou away evil from the midst of thee, and all Israel shall hear and shall fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And when there shall be sin in a man of the judgment of death, and he being put to death, and thou shalt hang him upon a tree:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">His carcass shall not pass the night upon the tree; for burying, ye shall bury him in that day, for he being hung is the curse of God; and thou shalt not defile thy land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee an inheritance.</p>
