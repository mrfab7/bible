<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Therefore I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Don’t be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I say, through the grace that was given me, to every man who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think reasonably, as God has apportioned to each person a measure of faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For even as we have many members in one body, and all the members don’t have the same function,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">so we, who are many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Having gifts differing according to the grace that was given to us, if prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of our faith;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">or service, let us give ourselves to service; or he who teaches, to his teaching;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">or he who exhorts, to his exhorting: he who gives, let him do it with liberality; he who rules, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor that which is evil. Cling to that which is good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">In love of the brothers be tenderly affectionate one to another; in honor preferring one another;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">not lagging in diligence; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">rejoicing in hope; enduring in troubles; continuing steadfastly in prayer;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">contributing to the needs of the saints; given to hospitality.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Bless those who persecute you; bless, and don’t curse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Be of the same mind one toward another. Don’t set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Don’t be wise in your own conceits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Repay no one evil for evil. Respect what is honorable in the sight of all men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If it is possible, as much as it is up to you, be at peace with all men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Don’t seek revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God’s wrath. For it is written, “Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Therefore “If your enemy is hungry, feed him. If he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing so, you will heap coals of fire on his head.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Don’t be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</p>
