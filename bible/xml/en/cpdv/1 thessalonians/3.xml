<chapter book="1 Thessalonians" number="3" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Because of this, willing to wait no longer, it was pleasing to us to remain at Athens, alone.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And we sent Timothy, our brother and a minister of God in the Gospel of Christ, to confirm you and to exhort you, on behalf of your faith,</verse>
  <verse number="3">so that no one would be disturbed during these tribulations. For you yourselves know that we have been appointed to this.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For even while we were with you, we predicted to you that we would suffer tribulations, even as it has happened, and as you know.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For this reason also, I was not willing to wait any longer, and I sent to find out about your faith, lest perhaps he who tempts may have tempted you, and our labor might have been in vain.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But then, when Timothy arrived to us from you, he reported to us your faith and charity, and that you keep a good remembrance of us always, desiring to see us, just as we likewise desire to see you.</verse>
  <verse number="7">As a result, we were consoled in you, brothers, in the midst of all our difficulties and tribulations, through your faith.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For we now live so that you may stand firm in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For what thanks would we be able to repay to God because of you, for all the joy with which we rejoice over you before our God?</verse>
  <verse number="10">For night and day, ever more abundantly, we are praying that we may see your face, and that we may complete those things that are lacking in your faith.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But may God our Father himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And may the Lord multiply you, and make you abound in your charity toward one another and toward all, just as we also do toward you,</verse>
  <verse number="13">in order to confirm your hearts without blame, in sanctity, before God our Father, unto the return of our Lord Jesus Christ, with all his saints. Amen.</verse>
