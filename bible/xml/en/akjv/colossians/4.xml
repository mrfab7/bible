  <verse number="1">Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;</verse>
  <verse number="3">With praying also for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:</verse>
  <verse number="4">That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer every man.</verse>
  <verse number="7">All my state shall Tychicus declare to you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord:</verse>
  <verse number="8">Whom I have sent to you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;</verse>
  <verse number="9">With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known to you all things which are done here.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salutes you, and Marcus, sister’s son to Barnabas, (touching whom you received commandments: if he come to you, receive him;)</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellow workers to the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort to me.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For I bear him record, that he has a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Salute the brothers which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And when this letter is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that you likewise read the letter from Laodicea.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.</verse>
