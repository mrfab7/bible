  <verse number="1">Brethren, my heart’s desire and my supplication to God is for them, that they may be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For being ignorant of God’s righteousness, and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness to every one that believeth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For Moses writeth that the man that doeth the righteousness which is of the law shall live thereby.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But the righteousness which is of faith saith thus, Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven? (that is, to bring Christ down:)</verse>
  <verse number="7">or, Who shall descend into the abyss? (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.)</verse>
  <verse number="8">But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach:</verse>
  <verse number="9">because if thou shalt confess with thy mouth Jesus as Lord, and shalt believe in thy heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved:</verse>
  <verse number="10">for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be put to shame.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek: for the same Lord is Lord of all, and is rich unto all that call upon him:</verse>
  <verse number="13">for, Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="14">How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?</verse>
  <verse number="15">and how shall they preach, except they be sent? even as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of them that bring glad tidings of good things!</verse>
  <verse number="16">But they did not all hearken to the glad tidings. For Isaiah saith, Lord, who hath believed our report?</verse>
  <verse number="17">So belief cometh of hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But I say, Did they not hear? Yea, verily, Their sound went out into all the earth, And their words unto the ends of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But I say, Did Israel not know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy with that which is no nation, With a nation void of understanding will I anger you.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Isaiah is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I became manifest unto them that asked not of me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But as to Israel he saith, All the day long did I spread out my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.</verse>
