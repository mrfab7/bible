<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="7" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, keep my words and treasure my commandments within you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Keep my commandments and live; guard my teachings as the apple of your eye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Tie them to your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” and call understanding your kinsman,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">that they may keep you from the adulteress, from the stranger with seductive words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For at the window of my house I looked through the lattice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I saw among the simple, I noticed among the youths, a young man lacking judgment,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">crossing the street near her corner, strolling down the road to her house,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">at twilight, as the day was fading into the dark of the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then a woman came out to meet him, with the attire of a harlot and cunning of heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">She is loud and defiant; her feet do not remain at home.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now in the street, now in the squares, she lurks at every corner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">She seizes him and kisses him; she brazenly says to him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">“I have made my peace offerings; today I have paid my vows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">So I came out to meet you; I sought you, and I have found you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I have decked my bed with coverings, with colored linen from Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, with aloes, and with cinnamon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Come, let us take our fill of love till morning. Let us delight in loving caresses!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He took with him a bag of money and will not return till the moon is full.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">With her great persuasion she entices him; with her flattering lips she lures him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He follows her on impulse, like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer bounding into a trap,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">until an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare—not knowing it will cost him his life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Now, my sons, listen to me, and attend to the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For she has brought many down to death; her slain are many in number.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Her house is the road to Sheol, descending to the chambers of death.</p>
