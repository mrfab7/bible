<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="4" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">LET a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ, and the dispensers of the mysteries of God.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Here now it is required among the dispensers, that a man be found faithful.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But to me it is a very small thing to be judged by you, or by man’s day; but neither do I judge my own self.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For I am not conscious to myself of any thing, yet am I not hereby justified; but he that judgeth me, is the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Therefore judge not before the time; until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall every man have praise from God.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollo, for your sakes; that in us you may learn, that one be not puffed up against the other for another, above that which is written.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For who distinguisheth thee ? Or what hast thou that thou hast not received ? And if thou hast received, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it ?</verse>
  <verse number="8">You are now full; you are now become rich; you reign without us; and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For I think that God hath set forth us apostles, the last, as it were men appointed to death: we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men.</verse>
  <verse number="10">We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; you are honourable, but we without honour.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Even unto this hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no fixed abode;</verse>
  <verse number="12">And we labour, working with our own hands: we are reviled, and we bless; we are persecuted, and we suffer it.</verse>
  <verse number="13">We are blasphemed, and we entreat; we are made as the refuse of this world, the offscouring of all even until now.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I write not these things to confound you; but I admonish you as my dearest children.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For if you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet not many fathers. For in Christ Jesus, by the gospel, I have begotten you.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For this cause have I sent to you Timothy, who is my dearest son and faithful in the Lord; who will put you in mind of my ways, which are in Christ Jesus; as I teach every where in every church.</verse>
  <verse number="18">As if I would not come to you, so some are puffed up.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will: and will know, not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For the kingdom of God is not in speech, but in power.</verse>
  <verse number="21">What will you ? shall I come to you with a rod; or in charity, and in the spirit of meekness ?</verse>
