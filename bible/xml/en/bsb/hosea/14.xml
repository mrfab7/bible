  <verse number="4">I will heal their apostasy; I will freely love them, for My anger has turned away from them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I will be like the dew to Israel; he will blossom like the lily and take root like the cedars of Lebanon.</verse>
  <verse number="6">His shoots will sprout, and his splendor will be like the olive tree, his fragrance like the cedars of Lebanon.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They will return and dwell in his shade; they will grow grain and blossom like the vine. His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon.</verse>
  <verse number="8">O Ephraim, what have I to do anymore with idols? It is I who answer and watch over him. I am like a flourishing cypress; your fruit comes from Me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Whoever is wise, let him understand these things; whoever is discerning, let him know them. For the ways of the LORD are right, and the righteous walk in them but the rebellious stumble in them.</verse>
