  <verse number="1">When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be you clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Jesus said to him, See you tell no man; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him,</verse>
  <verse number="6">And saying, Lord, my servant lies at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Jesus said to him, I will come and heal him.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that you should come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I say to this man, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">When Jesus heard it, he marveled, and said to them that followed, Truly I say to you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And I say to you, That many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Jesus said to the centurion, Go your way; and as you have believed, so be it done to you. And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother laid, and sick of a fever.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose, and ministered to them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">When the even was come, they brought to him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and healed all that were sick:</verse>
  <verse number="17">That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave commandment to depart to the other side.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And a certain scribe came, and said to him, Master, I will follow you wherever you go.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has not where to lay his head.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And another of his disciples said to him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But Jesus said to him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their dead.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, so that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And he said to them, Why are you fearful, O you of little faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But the men marveled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!</verse>
  <verse number="28">And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with you, Jesus, you Son of God? are you come here to torment us before the time?</verse>
  <verse number="30">And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine feeding.</verse>
  <verse number="31">So the devils sought him, saying, If you cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And he said to them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the devils.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they sought him that he would depart out of their coasts.</verse>
