1	Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, observe the sent and Chief Priest of our assent, Christ Jesus;
2	Faithful to him having made him, as also Moses in his whole house.
3	For this was deemed worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he has greater honour of the house having built it.
4	For every house is built by somebody; and he having built all things, God.
5	And truly Moses faithful in his whole house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things to be spoken;
6	And Christ as a son over his house: whose house are we, if we should hold freedom of speech and the boast of hope firm to the end.
7	Wherefore (as the Holy Spirit says, If to day ye hear his voice,
8	Harden not your hearts, as in the exasperation, in the day of trial in the desert:
9	Where your fathers tried me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.
10	Wherefore I was offended with that generation and I said, They always wander in heart; and they knew not my ways.
11	As I aware in my wrath, If they shall come into my rest.)
12	See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in removing away from the living God.
13	But beseech one another according to each day, as far as the day is called; lest any of you be hardened by deceit of sin.
14	For we have been partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our foundation firm to the end;
15	In that it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, ye should not harden your hearts, as in the exasperation.
16	For some, having heard, did exasperate: but not all they having come out of Egypt by Moses.
17	And with whom was he offended forty years? was it not with them having sinned, whose members fell in the desert?
18	And to whom sware he that they could not come into his rest, if not to them having been disobedient?
19	And we see they could not come in through unbelief.
