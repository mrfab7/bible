<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Should a wise man make answer with vain knowledge, And fill himself with the east wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Should he reason with unprofitable talk, Or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Yea, thou doest away with fear, And hinderest devotion before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For thine iniquity teacheth thy mouth, And thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; Yea, thine own lips testify against thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Art thou the first man that was born? Or wast thou brought forth before the hills?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Hast thou heard the secret counsel of God? And dost thou limit wisdom to thyself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What knowest thou, that we know not? What understandest thou, which is not in us?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">With us are both the grayheaded and the very aged men, Much elder than thy father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Are the consolations of God too small for thee, Even the word that is gentle toward thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Why doth thy heart carry thee away? And why do thine eyes flash,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">That against God thou turnest thy spirit, And lettest words go out of thy mouth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What is man, that he should be clean? And he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold, he putteth no trust in his holy ones; Yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">How much less one that is abominable and corrupt, A man that drinketh iniquity like water!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I will show thee, hear thou me; And that which I have seen I will declare</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">(Which wise men have told From their fathers, and have not hid it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Unto whom alone the land was given, And no stranger passed among them):</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, Even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">A sound of terrors is in his ears; In prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, And he is waited for of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Distress and anguish make him afraid; They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Because he hath stretched out his hand against God, And behaveth himself proudly against the Almighty;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He runneth upon him with a stiff neck, With the thick bosses of his bucklers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Because he hath covered his face with his fatness, And gathered fat upon his loins;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And he hath dwelt in desolate cities, In houses which no man inhabited, Which were ready to become heaps;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, Neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He shall not depart out of darkness; The flame shall dry up his branches, And by the breath of Godâ€™s mouth shall he go away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Let him not trust in vanity, deceiving himself; For vanity shall be his recompense.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">It shall be accomplished before his time, And his branch shall not be green.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, And shall cast off his flower as the olive-tree.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For the company of the godless shall be barren, And fire shall consume the tents of bribery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, And their heart prepareth deceit.</p>
