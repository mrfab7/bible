<p class="verse" data-verse="1">After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Job answered and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Let the day perish wherein I was born, And the night which said, There is a man-child conceived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Let that day be darkness; Let not God from above seek for it, Neither let the light shine upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their own; Let a cloud dwell upon it; Let all that maketh black the day terrify it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it: Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Lo, let that night be barren; Let no joyful voice come therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Let them curse it that curse the day, Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark: Let it look for light, but have none; Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Because it shut not up the doors of my motherâ€™s womb, Nor hid trouble from mine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bare me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should suck?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For now should I have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept; then had I been at rest,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">With kings and counsellors of the earth, Who built up waste places for themselves;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Or with princes that had gold, Who filled their houses with silver</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, As infants that never saw light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">There the wicked cease from troubling; And there the weary are at rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">There the prisoners are at ease together; They hear not the voice of the taskmaster.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The small and the great are there: And the servant is free from his master.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, And life unto the bitter in soul;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Who long for death, but it cometh not, And dig for it more than for hid treasures;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Who rejoice exceedingly, And are glad, when they can find the grave?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, And whom God hath hedged in?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For my sighing cometh before I eat, And my groanings are poured out like water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For the thing which I fear cometh upon me, And that which I am afraid of cometh unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; But trouble cometh.</p>
