<chapter book="Job" number="10" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My soul is weary of my life; I will give free course to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Hast thou eyes of flesh, or seest thou as man seeth?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Are thy days as the days of man, or thy years as man’s days,</verse>
  <verse number="6">That thou inquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin,</verse>
  <verse number="7">Although thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Thine hands have framed me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast fashioned me as clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Yet these things thou didst hide in thine heart; I know that this is with thee:</verse>
  <verse number="14">If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="15">If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet shall I not lift up my head; being filled with ignominy and looking upon mine affliction.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And if my head exalt itself, thou huntest me as a lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvelous upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and warfare are with me.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,</verse>
  <verse number="21">Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;</verse>
  <verse number="22">A land of thick darkness, as darkness itself; a land of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.</verse>
