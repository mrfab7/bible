<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And they will bring the ark of God and set it in the midst of the tent which David stretched out for it: and they will bring near burnt-offerings and peace before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And David will finish the bringing up of the burnt-offering and the peace, and he will bless the people in the name of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he will divide to every man of Israel from man and even to woman, to each a round of bread, and a measure and cakes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he will give before the ark of Jehovah from the Levites serving, and for keeping in remembrance, and to confess and to praise to Jehovah God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Asaph the head, and his second, Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-Edom: and Jeiel with instruments of lyres and harps; and Asaph with trumpets causing to hear;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Benaiah and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In that day thus David gave at the first to confess to Jehovah by the hand of Asaph and his brethren.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Sing ye to him, play on the harp to him, speak upon all his wonders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Praise ye in his holy name: the heart of those seeking Jehovah shall rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Seek ye Jehovah and his strength, seek his face always.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Remember ye his wonders which he did, and his miracles, and the judgments of his mouth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye sons of Jacob his chosen ones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He Jehovah our God; in all the earth his judgments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Remember ye forever his covenant; the word be commanded to a thousand generations;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Which he cut out with Abraham, and his oath to Isaak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he will cause it to stand to Jacob for a law, to Israel a covenant forever,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Saying, To thee I will give the land of Canaan, the cord of your inheritance;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">In your being men of number, as few, and strangers in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And they will go about from nation to nation, and from kingdom to another people;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And he permitted not to a man to oppress them: and for them he will reprove kings:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Ye shall not touch upon my Messiah, and upon my prophets ye shall not do evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Sing ye to Jehovah, all the earth; announce good news, from day to day his salvation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Recount his glory among the nations; his wonders among all peoples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For great is Jehovah, and greatly praised: and he to be feared above all gods.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For all the gods of the peoples nothings: and Jehovah made the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Glory and honor before his face; strength and joy in his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Give to Jehovah ye families of the peoples, give to Jehovah glory and strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Give ye to Jehovah the glory of his name: lift up a gift and come before him: worship to Jehovah the ornaments of holiness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Tremble from before him, all ye earth: also the habitable globe shall be set up, it shall not be shaken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The heavens shall rejoice, and the earth shall exult: and they shall say among the nations, Jehovah reigned:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">The sea shall tremble and its fulness, and the field shall rejoice and all that is in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Then shall the trees of the forest shout from the face of Jehovah, for he came to judge the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Confess ye to Jehovah, for he is good, for his mercy is forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And say ye, Save us, God of our salvation, and gather us together and deliver us from the nations, to confess to thy holy name, to glory in thy praise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Praised be Jehovah God of Israel from forever and even to forever. And all the people will say, Amen, and praise to Jehovah.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And Obed-Edom and his brethren, sixty and eight; and Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun and Hosah for gate-keepers:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the dwelling of Jehovah in the height which is in Gibeon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">To bring up burnt-offerings to Jehovah upon the altar of burnt-offering always at morning and at evening, and according to all written in the law of Jehovah which he charged upon Israel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest being chosen, who were separated by names to confess to Jehovah: for his mercy is forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And with them Heman and Jeduthun, with trumpets and cymbals to cause to hear, and instruments of song of God. And the sons of Jeduthun at the gate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And all the people will go each to his house: and David will turn about to bless his house.</p>
