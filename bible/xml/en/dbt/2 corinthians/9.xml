<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="9" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">For concerning the ministration which [is] for the saints, it is superfluous my writing to you.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For I know your readiness, which I boast of as respects you to Macedonians, that Achaia is prepared since a year ago, and the zeal [reported] of you has stimulated the mass [of the brethren].</verse>
  <verse number="3">But I have sent the brethren, in order that our boasting about you may not be made void in this respect, in order that, as I have said, ye may be prepared;</verse>
  <verse number="4">lest haply, if Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we, that we say not ye, may be put to shame in this confidence.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I thought it necessary therefore to beg the brethren that they would come to you, and complete beforehand your fore-announced blessing, that this may be ready thus as blessing, and not as got out of you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But this [is true], he that sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he that sows in [the spirit of] blessing shall reap also in blessing:</verse>
  <verse number="7">each according as he is purposed in his heart; not grievingly, or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But God is able to make every gracious gift abound towards you, that, having in every way always all-sufficiency, ye may abound to every good work:</verse>
  <verse number="9">according as it is written, He has scattered abroad, he has given to the poor, his righteousness remains for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Now he that supplies seed to the sower and bread for eating shall supply and make abundant your sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness:</verse>
  <verse number="11">enriched in every way unto all free-hearted liberality, which works through us thanksgiving to God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Because the ministration of this service is not only filling up the measure of what is lacking to the saints, but also abounding by many thanksgivings to God;</verse>
  <verse number="13">they glorifying God through the proof of this ministration, by reason of your subjection, by profession, to the glad tidings of the Christ, and your free-hearted liberality in communicating towards them and towards all;</verse>
  <verse number="14">and in their supplication for you, full of ardent desire for you, on account of the exceeding grace of God [which is] upon you.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thanks [be] to God for his unspeakable free gift.</verse>
