<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the heavens and the earth and all their host were finished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And God had finished on the seventh day his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it, because that on it he rested from all his work which God had created in making it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">These are the histories of the heavens and the earth, when they were created, in the day that Jehovah Elohim made earth and heavens,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and every shrub of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew; for Jehovah Elohim had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to till the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But a mist went up from the earth, and moistened the whole surface of the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And Jehovah Elohim formed Man, dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and Man became a living soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Jehovah Elohim planted a garden in Eden eastward, and there put Man whom he had formed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And out of the ground Jehovah Elohim made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; and the tree of life, in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And a river went out of Eden, to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became four main streams.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The name of the one is Pison: that is it which surrounds the whole land of Havilah, where the gold is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and the onyx stone are there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the name of the second river is Gihon: that is it which surrounds the whole land of Cush.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which flows forward toward Asshur. And the fourth river, that is Euphrates.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Jehovah Elohim took Man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to till it and to guard it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Jehovah Elohim commanded Man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou shalt freely eat;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eatest of it thou shalt certainly die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Jehovah Elohim said, It is not good that Man should be alone; I will make him a helpmate, his like.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And out of the ground Jehovah Elohim had formed every animal of the field and all fowl of the heavens, and brought [them] to Man, to see what he would call them; and whatever Man called each living soul, that was its name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Man gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the heavens, and to every beast of the field; but as for Adam, he found no helpmate, his like.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Jehovah Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall upon Man; and he slept. And he took one of his ribs and closed up flesh in its stead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Jehovah Elohim built the rib that he had taken from Man into a woman; and brought her to Man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Man said, This time it is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh: this shall be called Woman, because this was taken out of a man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and cleave to his wife; and they shall become one flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And they were both naked, Man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</p>
