<p class="verse" data-verse="1">He said to Moses, “Come up to Yahweh, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship from a distance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Moses alone shall come near to Yahweh, but they shall not come near, neither shall the people go up with him.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Moses came and told the people all the words of Yahweh, and all the ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice, and said, “All the words which Yahweh has spoken will we do.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Moses wrote all the words of Yahweh, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar under the mountain, and twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of cattle to Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He took the book of the covenant and read it in the hearing of the people, and they said, “All that Yahweh has spoken will we do, and be obedient.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people, and said, “Look, this is the blood of the covenant, which Yahweh has made with you concerning all these words.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was like a paved work of sapphire stone, like the skies for clearness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He didn’t lay his hand on the nobles of the children of Israel. They saw God, and ate and drank.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Yahweh said to Moses, “Come up to me on the mountain, and stay here, and I will give you the tables of stone with the law and the commands that I have written, that you may teach them.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Moses rose up with Joshua, his servant, and Moses went up onto God’s Mountain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He said to the elders, “Wait here for us, until we come again to you. Behold, Aaron and Hur are with you. Whoever is involved in a dispute can go to them.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The glory of Yahweh settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it six days. The seventh day he called to Moses out of the midst of the cloud.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The appearance of the glory of Yahweh was like devouring fire on the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and went up on the mountain; and Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.</p>
