  <verse number="2">And they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods: and the people ate, and bowed down to their gods.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Israel joined himself to Baal-peor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the LORD said to Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.</verse>

  <verse number="11">Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, (while he was zealous for my sake among them,) that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Wherefore say, Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.</verse>

  <verse number="17">Distress the Midianites, and smite them:</verse>
  <verse number="18">For they distress you with their wiles, with which they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian their sister, who was slain in the day of the plague for Peor’s sake.</verse>
