<chapter book="Job" number="33" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">“But now, O Job, hear my speech, and listen to all my words.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Behold, I will open my mouth; my address is on the tip of my tongue.</verse>
  <verse number="3">My words are from an upright heart, and my lips speak sincerely what I know.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Refute me if you can; prepare your case and confront me.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I am just like you before God; I was also formed from clay.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Surely no fear of me should terrify you; nor will my hand be heavy upon you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Surely you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard these very words:</verse>
  <verse number="9">‘I am pure, without transgression; I am clean, with no iniquity in me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Yet God finds occasions against me; He counts me as His enemy.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He puts my feet in the stocks; He watches over all my paths.’</verse>
  <verse number="12">Behold, you are not right in this matter. I will answer you, for God is greater than man.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Why do you complain to Him that He answers nothing a man asks?</verse>
  <verse number="14">For God speaks in one way and in another, yet no one notices.</verse>
  <verse number="15">In a dream, in a vision in the night, when deep sleep falls upon men as they slumber on their beds,</verse>
  <verse number="16">He opens their ears and terrifies them with warnings</verse>
  <verse number="17">to turn a man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride,</verse>
  <verse number="18">to preserve his soul from the Pit and his life from perishing by the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="19">A man is also chastened on his bed with pain and constant distress in his bones,</verse>
  <verse number="20">so that he detests his bread, and his soul loathes his favorite food.</verse>
  <verse number="21">His flesh wastes away from sight, and his hidden bones protrude.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He draws near to the Pit, and his life to the messengers of death.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Yet if there is a messenger on his side, one mediator in a thousand, to tell a man what is right for him,</verse>
  <verse number="24">to be gracious to him and say, ‘Spare him from going down to the Pit; I have found his ransom,’</verse>
  <verse number="25">then his flesh is refreshed like a child’s; he returns to the days of his youth.</verse>
  <verse number="26">He prays to God and finds favor; he sees God’s face and shouts for joy, and God restores His righteousness to that man.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Then he sings before men with these words: ‘I have sinned and perverted what was right; yet I did not get what I deserved.</verse>
  <verse number="28">He redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit, and I will live to see the light.’</verse>
  <verse number="29">Behold, all these things God does to a man, two or even three times,</verse>
  <verse number="30">to bring back his soul from the Pit, that he may be enlightened with the light of life.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Pay attention, Job, and listen to me; be silent, and I will speak.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But if you have something to say, answer me; speak up, for I would like to vindicate you.</verse>
  <verse number="33">But if not, then listen to me; be quiet, and I will teach you wisdom.”</verse>
