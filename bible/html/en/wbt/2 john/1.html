<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The elder to the elect lady, and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For the truthâ€™s sake which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Grace be with you, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I rejoiced greatly, that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment to thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments. This is the commandment, that as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For many deceivers have entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver, and an antichrist.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Whoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If any one cometh to you, and bringeth not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither wish him happiness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For he that wisheth him happiness, is partaker of his evil deeds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Having many things to write to you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come to you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.</p>
