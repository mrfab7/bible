<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Every wise woman buildeth her house; But the foolish plucketh it down with her own hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">He that walketh in his uprightness feareth Jehovah; But he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">In the mouth of the foolish is a rod for his pride; But the lips of the wise shall preserve them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Where no oxen are, the crib is clean; But much increase is by the strength of the ox.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A faithful witness will not lie; But a false witness uttereth lies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">A scoffer seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not; But knowledge is easy unto him that hath understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Go into the presence of a foolish man, And thou shalt not perceive in him the lips of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way; But the folly of fools is deceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A trespass-offering mocketh fools; But among the upright there is good will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The heart knoweth its own bitterness; And a stranger doth not inter-meddle with its joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The house of the wicked shall be overthrown; But the tent of the upright shall flourish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">There is a way which seemeth right unto a man; But the end thereof are the ways of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; And the end of mirth is heaviness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways; And a good man shall be satisfied from himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The simple believeth every word; But the prudent man looketh well to his going.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil; But the fool beareth himself insolently, and is confident.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He that is soon angry will deal foolishly; And a man of wicked devices is hated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The simple inherit folly; But the prudent are crowned with knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The evil bow down before the good; And the wicked, at the gates of the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The poor is hated even of his own neighbor; But the rich hath many friends.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He that despiseth his neighbor sinneth; But he that hath pity on the poor, happy is he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Do they not err that devise evil? But mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">In all labor there is profit; But the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The crown of the wise is their riches; But the folly of fools is only folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">A true witness delivereth souls; But he that uttereth lies causeth deceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">In the fear of Jehovah is strong confidence; And his children shall have a place of refuge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The fear of Jehovah is a fountain of life, That one may depart from the snares of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">In the multitude of people is the king’s glory; But in the want of people is the destruction of the prince.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He that is slow to anger is of great understanding; But he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">A tranquil heart is the life of the flesh; But envy is the rottenness of the bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker; But he that hath mercy on the needy honoreth him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">The wicked is thrust down in his evil-doing; But the righteous hath a refuge in his death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding; But that which is in the inward part of fools is made known.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Righteousness exalteth a nation; But sin is a reproach to any people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">The king’s favor is toward a servant that dealeth wisely; But his wrath will be against him that causeth shame.</p>
