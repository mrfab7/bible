<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Why are not times treasured up with the Almighty? why do not they that know him see his days?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">They remove the landmarks; they violently take away the flocks and pasture them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow’s ox for a pledge;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They turn the needy out of the way: the afflicted of the land all hide themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Lo, [as] wild asses in the desert, they go forth to their work, seeking early for the prey: the wilderness [yieldeth] them food for [their] children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">They reap in the field the fodder thereof, and they gather the vintage of the wicked;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They pass the night naked without clothing, and have no covering in the cold;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and for want of a shelter embrace the rock...</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">These go naked without clothing, and, hungry, they bear the sheaf;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They press out oil within their walls, they tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out; and +God imputeth not the impiety.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">There are those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The murderer riseth with the light, killeth the afflicted and needy, and in the night is as a thief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the eye of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me; and he putteth a covering on [his] face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">In the dark they dig through houses; by day they shut themselves in; they know not the light:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the morning is to them all [as] the shadow of death; for they are familiar with the terrors of the shadow of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He is swift on the face of the waters; their portion is cursed on the earth: he turneth not unto the way of the vineyards.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Drought and heat consume snow waters; so doth Sheol those that have sinned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The womb forgetteth him; the worm feedeth sweetly on him: he shall be no more remembered; and unrighteousness is broken as a tree,—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He that despoileth the barren that beareth not, and doeth not good to the widow:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He draweth also the mighty with his power; he riseth up, and no [man] is sure of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">[God] setteth him in safety, and he resteth thereon; but his eyes are upon their ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">They are exalted for a little, and are no more; they are laid low; like all [other] are they gathered, and are cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?</p>
