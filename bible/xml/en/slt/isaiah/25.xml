  <verse number="1">O Jehovah, thou my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name, for thou didst a wonder; counsels from far off, stability, faithfulness.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For thou didst set from a city to a heap, a fortified city to ruins: a palace of strangers from a city; it shall not be built forever.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For this shall the strong people honor thee, the city of terrible nations shall fear thee.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For thou wert a fortress to the poor, a fortress to the needy in straits; to him a refuge from the inundation, a shadow from the heat when the wind of the terrible ones as the inundation of the wall.</verse>
  <verse number="5">As the heat in Zion the noise of strangers thou shalt bring down; the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the song of the terrible shall be humbled.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Jehovah of armies will make to all peoples in this mountain a drinking of fatness, a drinking of lees of wine, fatness of marrows, strained lees of wine.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he will swallow up in this mountain the face of the covering covered over all peoples, and the veil covered over all nations.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He swallowed up death for glory, the Lord Jehovah will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the reproach of his people he will remove from off all the earth, for Jehovah spake.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And it was said in that day, Behold, this our God, we hoped for him, and he will save us: this Jehovah, we hoped for him, we will rejoice and be glad in his salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For the hand of Jehovah shall rest in this mountain, and Moab was thrust down under him as straw was thrust down in the water of the dunghill.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he spread forth his hands in their midst, as he swimming will spread forth to swim: and he humbled their pride with the ambuscades of their hands.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the fortress of the height of thy walls shall be brought low; be humbled, be struck to the earth, even to the dust.</verse>
