  <verse number="1">In the third year of the reign of Belshazzar the king, a vision appeared unto me, [even] to me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And I saw in the vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was in the fortress of Shushan, which is in the province of Elam. And I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I lifted up mine eyes and saw, and behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns; and the two horns were high; and one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward, and no beast could stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; and he did according to his will, and became great.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And as I was considering, behold, a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran upon him in the fury of his power.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was enraged with him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns; and there was no power in the ram to stand before him; and he cast him down to the ground, and trampled upon him; and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the he-goat became exceeding great; but when he was become strong, the great horn was broken; and in its stead came up four notable ones toward the four winds of the heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which became exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the beauty [of the earth].</verse>
  <verse number="10">And it became great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down [some] of the host and of the stars to the ground, and trampled upon them.</verse>
  <verse number="11">(And he magnified [himself] even to the prince of the host, and from him the continual [sacrifice] was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast down.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And a time of trial was appointed unto the continual [sacrifice] by reason of transgression.) And it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practised and prospered.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto that one who spoke, How long shall be the vision of the continual [sacrifice] and of the transgression that maketh desolate, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden down under foot?</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he said unto me, Until two thousand and three hundred evenings [and] mornings: then shall the sanctuary be vindicated.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And it came to pass, when I Daniel had seen the vision, I sought for the understanding of it, and behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And I heard a man’s voice between [the banks of] the Ulai; and he called and said, Gabriel, make this [man] to understand the vision.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he came near where I stood; and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face; and he said unto me, Understand, son of man; for the vision is for the time of the end.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Now, as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep stupor, with my face toward the ground. And he touched me, and set me up where I had stood.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be at the end of the indignation: for at the set time the end shall be.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The ram that thou sawest having the two horns: they are the kings of Media and Persia.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the rough goat is the king of Greece; and the great horn that was between his eyes is the first king.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Now that being broken, whereas four stood up in its stead, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not with his power.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And at the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors shall have come to the full, a king of bold countenance, and understanding riddles, shall stand up.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy marvellously, and shall prosper, and shall practise, and shall destroy the mighty ones, and the people of the saints.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And through his cunning shall he cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he will magnify [himself] in his heart, and by prosperity will corrupt many; and he will stand up against the Prince of princes: but he shall be broken without hand.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the vision of the evening and the morning which hath been told is true; but close thou up the vision, for it is for many days [to come].</verse>
  <verse number="27">And I Daniel fainted, and was sick [certain] days: then I rose up, and did the king’s business. And I was astonished at the vision, but none understood [it].</verse>
