<p class="verse" data-verse="1">IN THE third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; and he carried them into the land of Shinar to the house of his god, and the vessels he brought into the treasure-house of his god.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the king spoke unto Ashpenaz his chief officer, that he should bring in certain of the children of Israel, and of the seed royal, and of the nobles,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">youths in whom was no blemish, but fair to look on, and skilful in all wisdom, and skilful in knowledge, and discerning in thought, and such as had ability to stand in the king’s palace; and that he should teach them the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the king appointed for them a daily portion of the king’s food, and of the wine which he drank, and that they should be nourished three years; that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Now among these were, of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the chief of the officers gave names unto them: unto Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abed-nego.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king’s food, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the chief of the officers that he might not defile himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And God granted Daniel mercy and compassion in the sight of the chief of the officers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the chief of the officers said unto Daniel: ‘I fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your food and your drink; for why should he see your faces sad in comparison with the youths that are of your own age? so would ye endanger my head with the king.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Then said Daniel to the steward, whom the chief of the officers had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Try thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the youths that eat of the king’s food; and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">So he hearkened unto them in this matter, and tried them ten days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer, and they were fatter in flesh, than all the youths that did eat of the king’s food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">So the steward took away their food, and the wine that they should drink, and gave them pulse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Now as for these four youths, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And at the end of the days which the king had appointed for bringing them in, the chief of the officers brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the king spoke with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore stood they before the king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters that were in all his realm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.</p>
