<chapter book="Hebrews" number="10" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">For the law is only a shadow of the good things to come, not the realities themselves. It can never, by the same sacrifices offered year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship.</verse>
  <verse number="2">If it could, would not the offerings have ceased? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt the guilt of their sins.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Instead, those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins,</verse>
  <verse number="4">because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Therefore, when Christ came into the world, He said: “Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You prepared for Me.</verse>
  <verse number="6">In burnt offerings and sin offerings You took no delight.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then I said, ‘Here I am, it is written about Me in the scroll: I have come to do Your will, O God.’”</verse>
  <verse number="8">In the passage above He says, “Sacrifices and offerings, burnt offerings and sin offerings You did not desire, nor did You delight in them” (although they are offered according to the law).</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then He adds, “Here I am, I have come to do Your will.” He takes away the first to establish the second.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And by that will, we have been sanctified through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Day after day every priest stands to minister and to offer again and again the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But when this Priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, He sat down at the right hand of God.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Since that time, He waits for His enemies to be made a footstool for His feet,</verse>
  <verse number="14">because by a single offering He has made perfect for all time those who are being sanctified.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. First He says:</verse>
  <verse number="16">“This is the covenant I will make with them after those days, declares the Lord. I will put My laws in their hearts and inscribe them on their minds.”</verse>
  <verse number="17">Then He adds: “Their sins and lawless acts I will remember no more.”</verse>
  <verse number="18">And where these have been forgiven, an offering for sin is no longer needed.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="20">by the new and living way opened for us through the curtain of His body,</verse>
  <verse number="21">and since we have a great priest over the house of God,</verse>
  <verse number="22">let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Let us hold resolutely to the hope we profess, for He who promised is faithful.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And let us consider how to spur one another on to love and good deeds.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Let us not neglect meeting together, as some have made a habit, but let us encourage one another, and all the more as you see the Day approaching.</verse>
  <verse number="26">If we deliberately go on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no further sacrifice for sins remains,</verse>
  <verse number="27">but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume all adversaries.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.</verse>
  <verse number="29">How much more severely do you think one deserves to be punished who has trampled on the Son of God, profaned the blood of the covenant that sanctified him, and insulted the Spirit of grace?</verse>
  <verse number="30">For we know Him who said, “Vengeance is Mine; I will repay,” and again, “The Lord will judge His people.”</verse>
  <verse number="31">It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Remember the early days that you were in the light. In those days, you endured a great conflict in the face of suffering.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Sometimes you were publicly exposed to ridicule and persecution; at other times you were partners with those who were so treated.</verse>
  <verse number="34">You sympathized with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property, knowing that you yourselves had a better and permanent possession.</verse>
  <verse number="35">So do not throw away your confidence; it holds a great reward.</verse>
  <verse number="36">You need to persevere, so that after you have done the will of God, you will receive what He has promised.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For, “In just a little while, He who is coming will come and will not delay.</verse>
  <verse number="38">But My righteous one will live by faith; and if he shrinks back, I will take no pleasure in him.”</verse>
  <verse number="39">But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.</verse>
