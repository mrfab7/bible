<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="6" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Dare any one of you, having a matter with the other, go to be judged before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?</verse>
  <verse number="2">have ye not known that the saints shall judge the world? and if by you the world is judged, are ye unworthy of the smaller judgments?</verse>
  <verse number="3">have ye not known that we shall judge messengers? why not then the things of life?</verse>
  <verse number="4">of the things of life, indeed, then, if ye may have judgment, those despised in the assembly—these cause ye to sit;</verse>
  <verse number="5">unto your shame I speak: so there is not among you one wise man, not even one, who shall be able to discern in the midst of his brethren!</verse>
  <verse number="6">but brother with brother doth go to be judged, and this before unbelievers!</verse>
  <verse number="7">Already, indeed, then, there is altogether a fault among you, that ye have judgments with one another; wherefore do ye not rather suffer injustice? wherefore be ye not rather defrauded?</verse>
  <verse number="8">but ye—ye do injustice, and ye defraud, and these—brethren!</verse>
  <verse number="9">have ye not known that the unrighteous the reign of God shall not inherit? be not led astray; neither whoremongers, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor sodomites,</verse>
  <verse number="10">nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, the reign of God shall inherit.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And certain of you were these! but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were declared righteous, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">All things are lawful to me, but all things are not profitable; all things are lawful to me, but I—I will not be under authority by any;</verse>
  <verse number="13">the meats are for the belly, and the belly for the meats. And God both this and these shall make useless; and the body is not for whoredom, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body;</verse>
  <verse number="14">and God both the Lord did raise, and us will raise up through His power.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Have ye not known that your bodies are members of Christ? having taken, then, the members of the Christ, shall I make them members of an harlot? let it be not!</verse>
  <verse number="16">have ye not known that he who is joined to the harlot is one body? ‘for they shall be—saith He—the two for one flesh.’</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="18">flee the whoredom; every sin—whatever a man may commit—is without the body, and he who is committing whoredom, against his own body doth sin.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Have ye not known that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own,</verse>
  <verse number="20">for ye were bought with a price; glorify, then, God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.</verse>
