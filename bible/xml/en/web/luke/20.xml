  <verse number="1">It happened on one of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the Good News, that the priests and scribes came to him with the elders.</verse>
  <verse number="2">They asked him, “Tell us: by what authority do you do these things? Or who is giving you this authority?”</verse>
  <verse number="3">He answered them, “I also will ask you one question. Tell me:</verse>
  <verse number="4">the baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?”</verse>
  <verse number="5">They reasoned with themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’</verse>
  <verse number="6">But if we say, ‘From men,’ all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.”</verse>
  <verse number="7">They answered that they didn’t know where it was from.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.”</verse>
  <verse number="9">He began to tell the people this parable. “A man planted a vineyard, and rented it out to some farmers, and went into another country for a long time.</verse>
  <verse number="10">At the proper season, he sent a servant to the farmers to collect his share of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him, and sent him away empty.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He sent yet another servant, and they also beat him, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.</verse>
  <verse number="12">He sent yet a third, and they also wounded him, and threw him out.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The lord of the vineyard said, ‘What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. It may be that seeing him, they will respect him.’</verse>
  <verse number="14">“But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.’</verse>
  <verse number="15">They threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
  <verse number="16">He will come and destroy these farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.” When they heard it, they said, “May it never be!”</verse>
  <verse number="17">But he looked at them, and said, “Then what is this that is written, ‘The stone which the builders rejected, the same was made the chief cornerstone?’</verse>
  <verse number="18">Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but it will crush whomever it falls on to dust.”</verse>
  <verse number="19">The chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him that very hour, but they feared the people—for they knew he had spoken this parable against them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">They watched him, and sent out spies, who pretended to be righteous, that they might trap him in something he said, so as to deliver him up to the power and authority of the governor.</verse>
  <verse number="21">They asked him, “Teacher, we know that you say and teach what is right, and aren’t partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?”</verse>
  <verse number="23">But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, “Why do you test me?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription are on it?” They answered, “Caesar’s.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">He said to them, “Then give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.”</verse>
  <verse number="26">They weren’t able to trap him in his words before the people. They marveled at his answer, and were silent.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Some of the Sadducees came to him, those who deny that there is a resurrection.</verse>
  <verse number="28">They asked him, “Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man’s brother dies having a wife, and he is childless, his brother should take the wife, and raise up children for his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="29">There were therefore seven brothers. The first took a wife, and died childless.</verse>
  <verse number="30">The second took her as wife, and he died childless.</verse>
  <verse number="31">The third took her, and likewise the seven all left no children, and died.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Afterward the woman also died.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them will she be? For the seven had her as a wife.”</verse>
  <verse number="34">Jesus said to them, “The children of this age marry, and are given in marriage.</verse>
  <verse number="35">But those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage.</verse>
  <verse number="36">For they can’t die any more, for they are like the angels, and are children of God, being children of the resurrection.</verse>
  <verse number="37">But that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he called the Lord ‘The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’</verse>
  <verse number="38">Now he is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for all are alive to him.”</verse>
  <verse number="39">Some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, you speak well.”</verse>
  <verse number="40">They didn’t dare to ask him any more questions.</verse>
  <verse number="41">He said to them, “Why do they say that the Christ is David’s son?</verse>
  <verse number="42">David himself says in the book of Psalms, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand,</verse>
  <verse number="43">until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.”’</verse>
  <verse number="44">“David therefore calls him Lord, so how is he his son?”</verse>
  <verse number="45">In the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples,</verse>
  <verse number="46">“Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts;</verse>
  <verse number="47">who devour widows’ houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these will receive greater condemnation.”</verse>
