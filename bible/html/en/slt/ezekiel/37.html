<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The hand of Jehovah was upon me, and he will bring me forth in the spirit of Jehovah, and he will set me down in the midst of the valley; and it was filled with bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he caused me to pass over them round about, round about: and behold, exceeding many upon the face of the valley; and behold, exceedingly dry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he will say to me, Son of man, shall these bones live? And saying, Thou Lord Jehovah knoweth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he will say to me, Prophesy over these bones, and say to them, Ye dry bones, hear the word of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thus said the Lord Jehovah to these bones: Behold, I bring upon you the spirit, and ye lived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And I gave sinews upon you, and I brought up flesh upon you, and I drew skin over you, and I gave spirit in you, and ye lived; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I prophesied as I was commanded: and there will be a voice as I prophesied, and behold a shaking, the bones will draw near, bone to his bone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And I saw and behold, upon them sinews and flesh came up, and the skin will draw over them from above: and no spirit in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he will say to me, prophesy to the spirit, prophesy, son of man, and say to the spirit, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Come from the four winds, O wind and blow upon these slain, and they shall live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I prophesied as he commanded me, and the spirit will come upon them and they will live, and they will stand upon their feet, an army great, exceedingly, exceedingly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And he will say to me, Son of man, these bones all the house of Israel: behold them saying, Our bones were dried up, and our hope perished, and we were cut off to us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For this, prophesy and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I opened your graves and brought you up from your graves, O my people, and I brought you to the land of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And ye knew that I was Jehovah in my opening your graves and in my bringing you up from your graves, O my People.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And I gave my spirit in you, and ye lived, and I caused you to rest upon your land: and ye knew that I Jehovah spake, and I did, says the Lord Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And thou son of man, take to thee one tree and write upon it, For Judah, and for the sons of Israel his company: and take one tree and write upon it, For Joseph, the tree of Ephraim, and all the house of Israel his company:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And draw them near one to one to thee, for one tree; and they were for one in thine hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And when the sons of thy people shall say to thee, saying, Wilt thou not announce to us what these to thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Speak to them, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold I take the tree of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his company, and I gave them upon him with the tree of Judah, and ye made them for one tree, and they were one in my hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the trees which thou shalt write upon them were in thy hand before their eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And speak to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I take the sons of Israel from among the nations where they went there, and I gathered them from round about, and I brought them to their land:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And I made them for one nation in the land in the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be to them all for king: and they shall no more be for two nations, and they shall no more be divided into two kingdoms at all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And they shall no more be defiled with their blocks and with their abominable things, and in all their transgressions: and I saved them from all their dwellings where they sinned in them, and I cleansed them: and they were to me for a people, and I will be to them for God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And my servant David a king over them; and one shepherd shall be to all of them: and in my judgments they shall go and they shall watch my laws and do them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And they shall dwell upon the land which I gave to my servant to Jacob which your fathers dwelt upon it, and they shall dwell upon it, they and their sons and their sonsâ€™ sons, even to forever: and David my servant a prince to them forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And I cut out to them a covenant of peace; it shall be an eternal covenant with them: and I gave them, and I multiplied them, and I gave my holy place in the midst of them forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And my dwelling was with them, and I was to them for God, and they shall be to me for a people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And the nations shall know that I am Jehovah consecrating Israel in my holy place, being in the midst of them forever.</p>
