<p class="verse" data-verse="1">For there is a going forth for silver, and a place for gold they will purify it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Iron shall be taken from the dust, and stone will pour out brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He set an end to darkness, and he searched out for all completeness: the stone of darkness and the shadow of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The torrent broke out from the sojourner; being forgotten of the foot, they were weak, they wandered from men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The earth, from it will come forth bread, and under it was turned as fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Its stones the place of the sapphire, and dust gold to it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">A beaten path the birds knew not, and the vultureâ€™s eye scanned it not:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The sons of pride trod it not, and the lion passed not by upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He stretched forth his hand upon the flint; he overturned the mountains from the roots.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He cut rivers in the rocks, and his eye saw every precious thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He bound the rivers from weeping, and he will bring forth the hidden thing to light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And from whence shall wisdom be found? and where this place of understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And man knew not its estimation, and it shall not be found in the land of the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The depth said, It is not in me: and the sea said, Not with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Shut up gold shall not be given for it, and silver shall not be weighed its price.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">It shall not be weighed with gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, and the sapphire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Gold and crystal shall not compare with it, and its exchange, vessels of pure gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">High things, and crystal, shall not be remembered: and the drawing out of wisdom above pearls.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The topaz of Cush shall not compare with it; with pure gold it shall not be weighed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And from whence shall wisdom come? and where this place of understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And being hid from the eyes of all living, and covered from the birds of the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Destruction and death said, We heard its report with our ears:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">God understood its way, and he knew its place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For he will look to the ends of the earth, he will see under all the heavens;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">To make the weight for the wind; and he weighed the waters by measure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">In his making a law for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the voices.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Then he saw, and he will recount it; he prepared it, and also he searched it out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And he will say to man, Behold, the fear of Jehovah, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.</p>
