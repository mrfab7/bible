<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Joshua will say to them, Pass ye over before the ark of Jehovah your God into the midst of Jordan, and lift up to you each one stone upon his shoulder according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel:</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Jehovah will say to Joshua, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Command the priests lifting up the ark of the testimony, and they shall come up out of Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Joshua will command the priests, saying, Come up out of Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And it will be in the priests lifting up the ark of the covenant of Jehovah coming up from the midst of Jordan, the soles of the feet of the priests were plucked up to the dry land, and the waters of Jordan will turn back to their place and will go as yesterday the third day, over all its banks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the people came up out of Jordan in the tenth to the first month, and they will encamp in Gilgal, in the extremity of the sunrising of Jericho.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="23">That Jehovah your God dried up the water of Jordan from before you till your passing through as Jehovah your God did to the sea of sedge which he dried up from before us till our passing through:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">So that all the people of the earth knew the hand of Jehovah that it is strong: so that ye shall fear Jehovah your God all the days.</p>
