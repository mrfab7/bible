  <verse number="1">A [good] name is better than precious ointment, and the day of death than the day of one’s birth.</verse>
  <verse number="2">It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting: in that that is the end of all men, and the living taketh it to heart.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Vexation is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools in the house of mirth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">It is better for a man to hear the rebuke of the wise, than to hear the song of fools.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This also is vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad, and a gift destroyeth the heart.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Better is the end of a thing than its beginning; better is a patient spirit than a proud spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Be not hasty in thy spirit to be vexed; for vexation resteth in the bosom of fools.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Say not, How is it that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Wisdom is as good as an inheritance, and profitable to them that see the sun.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For wisdom is a defence [as] money is a defence; but the excellency of knowledge is, [that] wisdom maketh them that possess it to live.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Consider the work of God; for who can make straight what he hath made crooked?</verse>
  <verse number="14">In the day of prosperity enjoy good, and in the day of adversity consider: God hath also set the one beside the other, to the end that man should find out nothing [of what shall be] after him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">All [this] have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a righteous [man] that perisheth by his righteousness, and there is a wicked [man] that prolongeth [his days] by his wickedness.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Be not righteous overmuch; neither make thyself overwise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?</verse>
  <verse number="17">Be not overmuch wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?</verse>
  <verse number="18">It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from that withdraw not thy hand: for he that feareth God cometh forth from them all.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty [men] that are in a city.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Surely there is not a righteous man upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth not.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Also give not heed unto all words that are spoken, lest thou hear thy servant curse thee.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For also thine own heart knoweth that oftentimes thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.</verse>
  <verse number="23">All this have I tried by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Whatever hath been, is far off, and exceeding deep: who will find it out?</verse>
  <verse number="25">I turned, I and my heart, to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom and reason, and to know wickedness to be folly, and foolishness to be madness;</verse>
  <verse number="26">and I found more bitter than death the woman whose heart is nets and snares, [and] whose hands are bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be caught by her.</verse>
  <verse number="27">See this which I have found, saith the Preacher, [searching] one by one to find out the reason;</verse>
  <verse number="28">which my soul yet seeketh, and I have not found: one man among a thousand have I found, but a woman among all those have I not found.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Only see this which I have found: that God made man upright, but they have sought out many devices.</verse>
