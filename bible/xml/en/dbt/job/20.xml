  <verse number="1">And Zophar the Naamathite answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Therefore do my thoughts give me an answer, and for this is my haste within me.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I hear a reproof putting me to shame; and [my] spirit answereth me by mine understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Knowest thou [not] this, that of old, since man was placed upon earth,</verse>
  <verse number="5">The exultation of the wicked is short, and the joy of the ungodly man but for a moment?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Though his height mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds,</verse>
  <verse number="7">Like his own dung doth he perish for ever; they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?</verse>
  <verse number="8">He flieth away as a dream, and is not found; and is chased away as a vision of the night.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The eye which saw him shall [see him] not again; and his place beholdeth him no more.</verse>
  <verse number="10">His children shall seek the favour of the poor, and his hands restore his wealth.</verse>
  <verse number="11">His bones were full of his youthful strength; but it shall lie down with him in the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth [and] he hide it under his tongue,</verse>
  <verse number="13">[Though] he spare it, and forsake it not, but keep it within his mouth,</verse>
  <verse number="14">His food is turned in his bowels; it is the gall of asps within him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">He hath swallowed down riches, but he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.</verse>
  <verse number="16">He shall suck the poison of asps; the viper’s tongue shall kill him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He shall not see streams, rivers, brooks of honey and butter.</verse>
  <verse number="18">That which he laboured for shall he restore, and not swallow down; its restitution shall be according to the value, and he shall not rejoice [therein].</verse>
  <verse number="19">For he hath oppressed, hath forsaken the poor; he hath violently taken away a house that he did not build.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Because he knew no rest in his craving, he shall save nought of what he most desired.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Nothing escaped his greediness; therefore his prosperity shall not endure.</verse>
  <verse number="22">In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits; every hand of the wretched shall come upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">It shall be that, to fill his belly, he will cast his fierce anger upon him, and will rain it upon him into his flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="24">If he have fled from the iron weapon, the bow of brass shall strike him through.</verse>
  <verse number="25">He draweth it forth; it cometh out of his body, and the glittering point out of his gall: terrors are upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="26">All darkness is laid up for his treasures: a fire not blown shall devour him; it shall feed upon what is left in his tent.</verse>
  <verse number="27">The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against him.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The increase of his house shall depart, flowing away in the day of his anger.</verse>
  <verse number="29">This is the portion of the wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed to him by God.</verse>
