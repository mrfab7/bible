  <verse number="1">And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Son of man, thou art dwelling in the midst of a house of contradiction, which to them eyes to see, and they saw not: ears to them to hear, and they heard not: for they are a house of contradiction.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And thou Son of man, make to thee vessels of captivity and emigrate by day before their eyes; and emigrating from thy place to another place before their eyes; perhaps they will see if they are a house of contradiction.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And bring forth thy vessels as vessels of captivity by day, before their eyes: and thou shalt go forth in the evening before their eyes, as the goings forth of captivity.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Before their eyes break through to thee in the wall, and bring forth by it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Before their eyes upon the shoulder thou shalt lift up, in thick darkness thou shalt bring forth: thou shalt cover thy face, and thou shalt not see the earth: for I gave thee a wonder to the house of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And I shall do thus as I was commanded: I brought forth the vessels as vessels of captivity by day, and in the evening I broke through for me in the wall with the hand; in the thick darkness I brought forth, upon the shoulder I lifted up before their eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the word of Jehovah will be to me in the morning, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="9">Son of man, did not the house of Israel, the house of contradiction, say to thee, What doest thou?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Say to them, thus said the Lord Jehovah: The ruler of this burden in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel which they are in the midst of them.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Say, I am your wonder: as I did, so it shall be done to them: by emigrating, they shall go into captivity.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the prince which is in the midst of them shall lift up upon the shoulder in thick darkness, and go forth: they shall break through into the wall to bring forth by it: he shall cover his face so that be shall not see the earth with the eye.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And I spread my net upon him, and he was taken in my net: and I brought him to Babel the land of the Chaldeans, and he shall not see it, and there he shall die.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And all which are round about him to help, and all his hosts, I will scatter to every wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And they shall know that I am Jehovah, in my scattering them in the nations; and I scattered them in the lands.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And I left of them men of number, from the sword and from famine, and from death, so that they shall recount all their abominations among the nations where they went there; and they shall know that I am Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="18">Son of man, thou shalt eat thy bread with trembling, and thou shalt drink thy water with disquiet and with dread;</verse>
  <verse number="19">And say to the people of the land, Thus said the Lord Jehovah to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to the land of Israel: they shall eat their bread with dread, and they shall drink their waters with astonishment, that her land shall be laid waste from her fulness from the violence of all dwelling in her.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the cities being inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be a desolation; and they knew that I am Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the word of Jehovah was to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="22">Son of man, what this parable to you upon the land of Israel, saying, The days will be prolonged and every vision perished?</verse>
  <verse number="23">For this, say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: I caused this parable to cease, and they shall no more use it for a parable in Israel; but speak to them: The days drew near, and the word of every vision.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For no more shall there be any vain vision and smooth divination in the midst of the house of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For I am Jehovah: I will speak, what word I will speak and it shall be done; it shall no more be protracted: for in your days, O house of contradiction, I will speak the word, and I did it, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="27">Son of man, behold the house of Israel saying, The vision which he saw is for many days, and for the times afar off he prophesied.</verse>
  <verse number="28">For this, say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: No more shall my words be protracted, for I will speak the word and it shall be done, says the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
