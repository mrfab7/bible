  <verse number="1">Then Zophar the Naamathite answered by saying:</verse>
  <verse number="2">In response, various thoughts succeed one another in me, and my mind moves quickly through different ideas.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The teaching you use to admonish me, I will hear, and the spirit of my understanding will respond for me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">This, I know, is from the beginning, from the time that man was set over the earth:</verse>
  <verse number="5">that the praise of the impious shall be short, and the joy of the hypocrite lasts only a moment.</verse>
  <verse number="6">If his pride ascends even towards the heavens, and his head touches the clouds,</verse>
  <verse number="7">in the end, he will be destroyed like a trash heap, and those who had seen him will say: “Where is he?”</verse>
  <verse number="8">Like a dream that flies away, he will not be found; he will pass away like a nightmare.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The eyes that had seen him, will not see him; no longer will his own place admire him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">His sons will be worn away by poverty, and his own hands will deliver his grief to him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">His bones will be filled with the vices of his youth, and they will sleep with him in the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For, when evil will be sweet in his mouth, he will hide it under his tongue.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He will permit it, and not abandon it, and he will conceal it in his throat.</verse>
  <verse number="14">His bread in his belly will be turned into the venom of snakes within him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The riches that he devours, he will vomit up, and from his stomach God will draw them out.</verse>
  <verse number="16">He will suck the head of snakes, and the tongue of the viper will kill him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">(May he never see the streams of the river, the torrents of honey and butter.)</verse>
  <verse number="18">He will be repaid for all he has done, yet he will not be consumed; according to the multitude of his schemes, so also will he suffer.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For, having broken in, he stripped the poor. He has quickly stolen away a house he did not build.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And yet his stomach will not be satisfied, and when he has the things he desires, he will not be able to possess them.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Nothing remained of his portion, and, because of this, nothing will continue of his kind.</verse>
  <verse number="22">When he will be satisfied, he will be constrained; he will seethe, and all anguish will fall upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">May his stomach be filled, so that God may send forth the fury of his wrath to him and may rain down his battle upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He will flee from weapons of iron, and he will fall in an arc of brass,</verse>
  <verse number="25">which had been drawn and had issued forth from its sheath, glittering in its bitterness: the horrible ones will go forth and approach over him.</verse>
  <verse number="26">All darkness has been hidden in his secrecy. A fire that has not been set will devour him; he will be thrown down and forsaken in his tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="27">The heavens will reveal his sinfulness, and the earth will rise up against him.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The offspring of his house will be exposed; he will be pulled down in the day of God’s wrath.</verse>
  <verse number="29">This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the inheritance of his words from the Lord.</verse>
