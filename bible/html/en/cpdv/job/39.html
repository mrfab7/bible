<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="39" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Do you know at what time the wild goats have given birth among the rocks, or do you observe the deer when they go into labor?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Have you numbered the months since their conception, and do you know at what time they gave birth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They bend themselves for their offspring, and they give birth, and they emit roars.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Their young are weaned and go out to feed; they depart and do not return to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who has set the wild ass free, and who has released his bonds?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I have given a house in solitude to him, and his tabernacle is in the salted land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He despises the crowded city; he does not pay attention to the bellow of the tax collector.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He looks around the mountains of his pasture, and he searches everywhere for green plants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Will the rhinoceros be willing to serve you, and will he remain in your stall?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Can you detain the rhinoceros with your harness to plough for you, and will he loosen the soil of the furrows behind you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Will you put your faith in his great strength, and delegate your labors to him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Will you trust him to return to you the seed, and to gather it on your drying floor?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The wing of the ostrich is like the wings of the heron, and of the hawk.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">When she leaves eggs behind in the earth, will you perhaps warm them in the dust?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">She forgets that feet may trample them, or that the beasts of the field may shatter them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">She is hardened against her young, as if they were not hers; she has labored in vain, with no fear compelling her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For God has deprived her of wisdom; neither has he given her understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Yet, when the time is right, she raises her wings on high; she ridicules the horse and his rider.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Will you supply strength to the horse, or envelope his throat with neighing?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Will you alarm him as the locusts do? His panic is revealed by the display of his nostrils.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He digs at the earth with his hoof; he jumps around boldly; he advances to meet armed men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He despises fear; he does not turn away from the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Above him, the quiver rattles, the spear and the shield shake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Seething and raging, he drinks up the earth; neither does he pause when the blast of the trumpet sounds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">When he hears the bugle, he says, “Ha!” He smells the battle from a distance, the exhortation of the officers, and the battle cry of the soldiers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Does the hawk grow feathers by means of your wisdom, spreading her wings towards the south?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Will the eagle lift herself up at your command and make her nest in steep places?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">She dwells among the rocks, and she lingers among broken boulders and inaccessible cliffs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">From there, she looks for food, and her eyes catch sight of it from far away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Her young will drink blood, and wherever the carcass will be, she is there immediately.</p>
