<chapter book="Job" number="41" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Wilt thou draw out the leviathan with the hook, and press down his tongue with a cord?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Wilt thou put a rush-rope into his nose, and pierce his jaw with a spike?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Will he make many supplications unto thee? or will he speak softly unto thee?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him as a bondman for ever?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Wilt thou play with him as with a bird, and wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Shall partners make traffic of him, will they divide him among merchants?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Wilt thou fill his skin with darts, and his head with fish-spears?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Lay thy hand upon him; remember the battle,—do no more!</verse>
  <verse number="9">Lo, hope as to him is belied: is not one cast down even at the sight of him?</verse>
  <verse number="10">None is so bold as to stir him up; and who is he that will stand before me?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Who hath first given to me, that I should repay [him]? [Whatsoever is] under the whole heaven is mine.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I will not be silent as to his parts, the story of his power, and the beauty of his structure.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who can uncover the surface of his garment? who can come within his double jaws?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The rows of his shields are a pride, shut up together [as with] a close seal.</verse>
  <verse number="16">One is so near to another that no air can come between them;</verse>
  <verse number="17">They are joined each to its fellow; they stick together, and cannot be sundered.</verse>
  <verse number="18">His sneezings flash light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Out of his mouth go forth flames; sparks of fire leap out:</verse>
  <verse number="20">Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a boiling pot and cauldron.</verse>
  <verse number="21">His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="22">In his neck lodgeth strength, and terror danceth before him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are fused upon him, they cannot be moved.</verse>
  <verse number="24">His heart is firm as a stone, yea, firm as the nether [millstone].</verse>
  <verse number="25">When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: they are beside themselves with consternation.</verse>
  <verse number="26">If any reach him with a sword, it cannot hold; neither spear, nor dart, nor harpoon.</verse>
  <verse number="27">He esteemeth iron as straw, bronze as rotten wood.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The arrow will not make him flee; slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Clubs are counted as stubble; he laugheth at the shaking of a javelin.</verse>
  <verse number="30">His under parts are sharp potsherds: he spreadeth a threshing-sledge upon the mire.</verse>
  <verse number="31">He maketh the deep to boil like a pot; he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment;</verse>
  <verse number="32">He maketh the path to shine after him: one would think the deep to be hoary.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</verse>
  <verse number="34">He beholdeth all high things; he is king over all the proud beasts.</verse>
