  <verse number="1">As to the rest, pray ye, brethren, concerning us, that the word of the Lord may run and may be glorified, as also with you,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and that we may be delivered from the unreasonable and evil men, for the faith is not of all;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and stedfast is the Lord, who shall establish you, and shall guard you from the evil;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that the things that we command you ye both do and will do;</verse>
  <verse number="5">and the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God, and to the endurance of the Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to withdraw yourselves from every brother disorderly walking, and not after the deliverance that ye received from us,</verse>
  <verse number="7">for yourselves have known how it behoveth you to imitate us, because we did not act disorderly among you;</verse>
  <verse number="8">nor for nought did we eat bread of any one, but in labour and in travail, night and day working, not to be chargeable to any of you;</verse>
  <verse number="9">not because we have not authority, but that ourselves a pattern we might give to you, to imitate us;</verse>
  <verse number="10">for even when we were with you, this we did command you, that if any one is not willing to work, neither let him eat,</verse>
  <verse number="11">for we hear of certain walking among you disorderly, nothing working, but over working,</verse>
  <verse number="12">and such we command and exhort through our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness working, their own bread they may eat;</verse>
  <verse number="13">and ye, brethren, may ye not be weary doing well,</verse>
  <verse number="14">and if any one do not obey our word through the letter, this one note ye, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed,</verse>
  <verse number="15">and as an enemy count him not, but admonish ye him as a brother;</verse>
  <verse number="16">and may the Lord of the peace Himself give to you the peace always in every way; the Lord is with you all!</verse>
  <verse number="17">The salutation by the hand of me, Paul, which is a sign in every letter; thus I write;</verse>
  <verse number="18">the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ is with you all! Amen.</verse>
