<chapter book="1 Peter" number="2" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Therefore setting aside all wickedness, and all artifice, and dissimulation; and envies, and all calumnies,</verse>
  <verse number="2">As new born babes, long for the sincere milk pertaining to the word, that ye might be nourished with it:</verse>
  <verse number="3">If ye have tasted that the Lord is good.</verse>
  <verse number="4">To whom approaching, a living stone, truly disapproved of by men, and chosen by God, highly valued,</verse>
  <verse number="5">And ye yourselves are built, as living stones, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to bring up spiritual sacrifice; acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Wherefore also it holds in the writing, Behold, I place in Zion a corner stone, chosen, highly valued: and he believing on him shall not be ashamed.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore honour to you believing: and to the unbelieving, the stone which the builders disapproved of has become the head of the corner,</verse>
  <verse number="8">And a stone of stumble, and rock of offence, they disbelieving the word stumble: to which also they were set.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And ye a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for acquisition; so that ye should proclaim the excellencies of him having called you out of darkness into his wonderful light:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Who once not a people, and now the people of God: they not commiserated, and now commiserated.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Dearly beloved, I beseech as sojourners and strangers, to keep off from fleshly passions, which war against the soul;</verse>
  <verse number="12">Having your turning back good in the nations: that, in what they speak against you as doing evil, from good works, they having beheld, might praise God in the day of inspection.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Be subjected to every creation proceeding from man on account of the Lord: whether to the king, as having superiority;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Or to chiefs, as sent by him for the punishing of them doing evil, and the praise of them doing good.</verse>
  <verse number="15">(For so is the will of God, those doing good to silence the want of knowledge of the foolish men:)</verse>
  <verse number="16">As free, and as not having liberty for a covering of wickedness, but as the servants of God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Honour all. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Servants being subjected to masters in all fear; not only to the good and equitable, but also to the crooked.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For this is grace, if any by consciousness of God bear grief, suffering unjustly.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For what glory, if, sinning and being cuffed, ye endure? but if, doing good, and suffering, ye endure, this is grace with God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For to this were ye called: for also Christ suffered for you, leaving behind to you an underwriting, that ye should follow upon his footsteps:</verse>
  <verse number="22">Who did no sin, nor was deceit found in his mouth:</verse>
  <verse number="23">Who, being reviled, reviled not back; suffering, he threatened not; and delivered to him judging justly;</verse>
  <verse number="24">Who himself bear up our sins in his body upon the wood, that we, removed from sins, should live to justice: by whose bloody mark ye were healed.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For ye were as sheep going astray; but now have turned about to the Shepherd and inspector of your souls.</verse>
