<div class="chapter" data-book="2 John" data-chapter="1" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The elder, To the chosen lady and her children, whom I love in the truth—and not I alone, but also all who know the truth—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, will be with us in truth and love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I was overjoyed to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as the Father has commanded us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And now I urge you, dear lady—not as a new commandment to you, but one we have had from the beginning—that we love one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the very commandment you have heard from the beginning, that you must walk in love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For many deceivers have gone out into the world, refusing to confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Watch yourselves, so that you do not lose what we have worked for, but that you may be fully rewarded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Anyone who runs ahead without remaining in the teaching of Christ does not have God. Whoever remains in His teaching has both the Father and the Son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If anyone comes to you but does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your home or even greet him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Whoever greets such a person shares in his evil deeds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I have many things to write to you, but I would prefer not to do so with paper and ink. Instead, I hope to come and speak with you face to face, so that our joy may be complete.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The children of your elect sister send you greetings.</p>
