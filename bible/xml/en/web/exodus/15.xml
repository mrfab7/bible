  <verse number="1">Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Yahweh, and said, “I will sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously. The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Yah is my strength and song. He has become my salvation. This is my God, and I will praise him; my father’s God, and I will exalt him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Yahweh is a man of war. Yahweh is his name.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He has cast Pharaoh’s chariots and his army into the sea. His chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The deeps cover them. They went down into the depths like a stone.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Your right hand, Yahweh, is glorious in power. Your right hand, Yahweh, dashes the enemy in pieces.</verse>
  <verse number="7">In the greatness of your excellency, you overthrow those who rise up against you. You send forth your wrath. It consumes them as stubble.</verse>
  <verse number="8">With the blast of your nostrils, the waters were piled up. The floods stood upright as a heap. The deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The enemy said, ‘I will pursue. I will overtake. I will divide the spoil. My desire shall be satisfied on them. I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.’</verse>
  <verse number="10">You blew with your wind. The sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Who is like you, Yahweh, among the gods? Who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?</verse>
  <verse number="12">You stretched out your right hand. The earth swallowed them.</verse>
  <verse number="13">“You, in your loving kindness, have led the people that you have redeemed. You have guided them in your strength to your holy habitation.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The peoples have heard. They tremble. Pangs have taken hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed. Trembling takes hold of the mighty men of Moab. All the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Terror and dread falls on them. By the greatness of your arm they are as still as a stone—until your people pass over, Yahweh, until the people pass over who you have purchased.</verse>
  <verse number="17">You shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of your inheritance, the place, Yahweh, which you have made for yourself to dwell in; the sanctuary, Lord, which your hands have established.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Yahweh shall reign forever and ever.”</verse>
  <verse number="19">For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and Yahweh brought back the waters of the sea on them; but the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of the sea.</verse>

  <verse number="25">Then he cried to Yahweh. Yahweh showed him a tree, and he threw it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet. There he made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there he tested them;</verse>
  <verse number="26">and he said, “If you will diligently listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, and will do that which is right in his eyes, and will pay attention to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you, which I have put on the Egyptians; for I am Yahweh who heals you.”</verse>
  <verse number="27">They came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water, and seventy palm trees: and they encamped there by the waters.</verse>
