<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And now Israel, hear to the laws and to the judgments which I am teaching you to do, so that ye shall live and go in and possess the land which Jehovah the God of your fathers gave to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Ye shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, and ye shall not take away from it, to watch the commands of Jehovah your God which I am commanding you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Your eyes saw what Jehovah did upon Baal-Peor: for every man who went after Baal-Peor, Jehovah thy God destroyed him from the midst of you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And ye cleaving to Jehovah your God, are living all of you this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">See, I taught you laws and judgments as Jehovah my God commanded me, to do thus in the midst of the land where ye are going there to possess it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And watch and do: for it is your wisdom and your understanding before the eyes of the peoples who shall hear all these laws, and say, Only this great nation a wise and understanding people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For what great nation to whom God being near to it as Jehovah our God in all our calling to him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And what great nation to whom laws and judgments just, as all the instructions which I give before you this day?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Only watch to thyself and watch thy soul greatly, lest thou shalt forget the words which thine eyes saw, and lest they shall remove from thy heart all the days of thy life: and make them known to thy sons and to the sons of thy sons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The day thou stoodest before Jehovah thy God in Horeb, in Jehovah saying to me, Gather to me the people and I will cause them to hear my word, that they shall be taught to fear me all the days which they live upon the land; and they shall teach their sons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And ye shall come near and shall stand under the mountain; and the mountain burnt with fire even to the heart of the heavens, darkness, cloud, and gloom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Jehovah will speak to you from the midst of the fire, ye hearing a voice of words, and ye seeing not an appearance, except a voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And he will announce to you his covenant which he commanded you to do, the ten words; and he will write them upon two tables of stones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Jehovah commanded me in that time to teach you laws and judgments for you to do them in the land which ye are passing over there to possess it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And watch ye greatly to your souls, for ye saw not any appearance in the day Jehovah spoke to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Lest ye shall be corrupted and make to you a carved thing, the appearance of any likeness, the model of male or female,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The model of any cattle that is upon the earth, the model of any winged bird that shall fly in the heavens,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The model of any thing creeping upon the earth, the model of any fish that is in the waters from under the earth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And lest thou shalt lift up thine eyes to the heavens, and seeing the sun and the moon and the stars, all the army of the heavens, and thou wert driven and didst worship to them, and didst serve them, which Jehovah thy God divided them out to all the peoples under all the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Jehovah took you and brought you forth out of the furnace of iron, out of Egypt, to be to him for a people of inheritance as this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Jehovah will be angry with me on account of your words, and he will swear for me not to pass through Jordan, and not to go in to the good land which Jehovah thy God gave to thee an inheritance:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For I die in this land, not to pass over Jordan: and ye are passing over and shall possess this good land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Watch for yourselves lest ye shall forget the covenant of Jehovah your God which he cut out with you, and ye make to you any carved thing, the appearance of any thing which Jehovah thy God commanded thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For Jehovah thy God he is a consuming fire, a jealous God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">When thou shalt beget sons, and sons’ sons, and ye rested in the land and were corrupted, and made a carved thing, the appearance of any thing, and ye did evil in the eyes of Jehovah thy God to irritate him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I took the heavens and the earth to witness against you this day, that perishing, ye shall perish to-morrow from the land which ye are passing over Jordan there to possess it: ye shall not prolong the days upon it, but being destroyed, ye shall be destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And Jehovah scattered you among the peoples, and ye remained men of number among the nations where Jehovah will lead you there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And ye served there gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which shall not see, and shall not hear, and shall not eat, and shall not breathe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And thou sought from thence Jehovah thy God, and thou didst find, for ye shall seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">In straitness to thee, and all these words found thee in the last of the days, and thou didst turn to Jehovah thy God and heardest to his voice;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For Jehovah thy God a merciful God; he will not desert thee, and he will not destroy thee, and he will not forget the covenant of thy fathers which he sware to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For ask now to the former days which were before thee from the day that God created man upon the earth, and from the end of the heavens to the end of the heavens, Has there been as this great word, or was heard like it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Did people hear the voice of God speaking from the midst of the fire as thou didst hear, and shall live?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Or did God try to go and take to him a nation from the midst of a nation by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a strong hand and by an extended arm, and by great fears, according to all that Jehovah your God did to you in Egypt before your eyes?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Thou sawest to know that Jehovah he is God: no more beside him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Out of the heavens he caused thee to hear his voice to instruct thee: and upon earth he caused thee to see his great fire, and thou heardest his words from the midst of the fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And because that he loved thy fathers he will choose in his seed after him, and he will bring thee out before him with his great strength from Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">To drive out nations great and strong above thee, from thy face, to bring thee in to give to thee their land an inheritance as this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And know thou this day, and turn back to thy heart, that Jehovah he is God in the heavens from above and upon the earth underneath: and none yet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And watch thou his laws and his commands which I am commanding thee this day, that it shall be good to thee and to thy sons after thee, and that thou shalt prolong the days upon the land that Jehovah thy God gave to thee, all the days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Then Moses will separate three cities in the other side of Jordan from the rising of the sun;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">For the slayer to flee there when he shall slay his friend without knowledge; and he hated him not yesterday the third day; and he fled to one of these cities and he lived:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">Bezer in the desert, in the land of the plain to the Reubenites, and Ramoth in Gilead to the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan, to the Manassites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And this the instruction which Moses set before the sons of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">These the testimonies and the laws and the judgments which Moses spake to the sons of Israel in their going forth out of Egypt,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">In the other side of Jordan, in the valley over against the House of Peor, in the land of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who will dwell in Heshbon, whom Moses smote, and the sons of Israel, in their going out of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">And they shall possess their land and the land of Og, king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, which in the other side of Jordan from the rising of the sun;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">From Aroer, which is upon the lip of the torrent Arnon, and even to mount Sion (it is Hermon.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">And all the desert the other side of Jordan, from the sun-rising and even to the sea, the desert under the springs of Pisgah.</p>
