1	We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain.
2	(For he said, I have heard you in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succored you: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)
3	Giving no offense in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:
4	But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,
5	In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in watchings, in fastings;
6	By pureness, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,
7	By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
8	By honor and dishonor, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;
9	As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;
10	As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.
11	O you Corinthians, our mouth is open to you, our heart is enlarged.
12	You are not straitened in us, but you are straitened in your own bowels.
13	Now for a recompense in the same, (I speak as to my children,) be you also enlarged.
14	Be you not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness?
15	And what concord has Christ with Belial? or what part has he that believes with an infidel?
16	And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? for you are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
17	Why come out from among them, and be you separate, said the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.
18	And will be a Father to you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, said the Lord Almighty.
