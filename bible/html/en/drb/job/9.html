<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="9" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job answered, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Indeed I know it is so, and that man cannot be justified compared with</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one for a thousand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath resisted him, and hath had peace ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who hath removed mountains, and they whom he overthrew in his wrath, knew it not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Who shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Who commandeth tile sun and it riseth not: and shutteth up the stars as it were under a seal:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Who alone spreadeth out the heavens, and walketh upon the waves of the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who maketh Arcturus, and Orion, and Hyades, and the inner parts of the south.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who doth things great and incomprehensible, and wonderful, of which there is no number.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If he come to me, I shall not see him: if he depart I shall not understand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If he examine on a sudden, who shall answer him? or who can say: Why dost thou so?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">God, whose wrath no man can resist, and under whom they stoop that bear up the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What am I then, that I should answer him, and have words with him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I, who although I should have any just thing, would not answer, but would make supplication to my judge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And if he should hear me when I call, I should not believe that he had heard my voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For he shall crush me in a whirlwind, and multiply my wounds even without cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He alloweth not my spirit to rest, and he filleth me with bitterness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If strength be demanded, he is most strong: if equity of judgment, no man dare bear witness for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">If I would justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me: if I would shew myself innocent, he shall prove me wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Although I should be simple, even this my soul shall be ignorant of, and I shall be weary of my life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">One thing there is that I have spoken, both the innocent and the wicked he consumeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If he scourge, let him kill at once, and not laugh at the pains of the innocent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The earth is given into the hand of the wicked, he covereth the face of the judges thereof: and if it be not he, who is it then?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">My days have been swifter than a post: they have fled away and have not seen good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">They have passed by as ships carrying fruits, as an eagle flying to the prey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">If I say: I will not speak so: I change my face, and am tormented with sorrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">I feared all my works, knowing that thou didst not spare the offender.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">But if so also I am wicked, why have I laboured in vain?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">If I be washed as it were with snow waters, and my hands shall shine ever so clean :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Yet thou shalt plunge me in filth, and my garments shall abhor me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For I shall not answer a man that is like myself: nor one that may be heard with me equally in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">There is none that may be able to reprove both, and to put his hand between both.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">I will speak, and will not fear him: for I cannot answer while I am in fear.</p>
