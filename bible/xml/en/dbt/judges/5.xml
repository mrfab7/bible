  <verse number="1">Then sang Deborah and Barak, the son of Abinoam, on that day, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">For that leaders led in Israel, For that the people willingly offered themselves, Bless Jehovah!</verse>
  <verse number="3">Hear, ye kings; give ear, ye princes, I, [even] I, will sing to Jehovah; I will hymn to Jehovah the God of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Jehovah, when thou wentest forth from Seir, When thou marchedst out of the fields of Edom, The earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, Yea, the clouds dropped water.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The mountains quaked before the face of Jehovah, That Sinai, from before Jehovah the God of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="6">In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, The roads were unused, and the travellers on highways went by crooked paths.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The villages ceased in Israel, Ceased until that I Deborah arose, That I arose a mother in Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="8">They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?</verse>
  <verse number="9">My heart is toward the governors of Israel, who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless Jehovah!</verse>
  <verse number="10">Ye that ride on white she-asses, ye that sit on carpets, and ye that walk by the way, consider.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Because of the voice of those who divide [the spoil] in the midst of the places of drawing water; There they rehearse the righteous acts of Jehovah, His righteous acts toward his villages in Israel. Then the people of Jehovah went down to the gates.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Awake, awake, Deborah! awake, awake, utter a song! Arise, Barak, and lead captive thy captives, thou son of Abinoam!</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then come down, thou, the remnant of nobles, [as his] people; Jehovah! come down with me in the midst of the mighty ones.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Out of Ephraim [came] those whose root was in Amalek; After thee was Benjamin among thy peoples. Out of Machir came down governors, And out of Zebulun they that handled the staff of the ruler.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the princes in Issachar were with Deborah; And Issachar, like Barak; They were sent into the valley at his feet. In the divisions of Reuben there were great resolves of heart!</verse>
  <verse number="16">Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, To hear the bleating of the flocks? In the divisions of Reuben there were great deliberations of heart!</verse>
  <verse number="17">Gilead abode beyond Jordan; And Dan, why did he remain in ships? Asher sat on the sea-shore, And abode in his creeks.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Zebulun is a people [that] jeoparded their lives unto death, Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Kings came,—they fought; Then fought the kings of Canaan; At Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo; They took no spoil of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="20">From heaven was the fight; The stars from their courses fought with Sisera.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The torrent of Kishon swept them away, That ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon. My soul, thou hast trodden down strength!</verse>
  <verse number="22">Then did the horse-hoofs clatter with the coursings, The coursings of their steeds.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Curse Meroz, saith the Angel of Jehovah; Curse, curse the inhabitants thereof; For they came not to the help of Jehovah, To the help of Jehovah among the mighty.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be, Blessed above women in the tent!</verse>
  <verse number="25">He asked water, she gave milk; In the nobles’ bowl she brought forth cream.</verse>
  <verse number="26">She put her hand to the tent-pin, And her right hand to the workmen’s hammer; And she smote Sisera, she struck through his head, Shattered and pierced through his temples.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Between her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: Between her feet he bowed, he fell; Where he bowed, there he fell, overcome.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Them other of Sisera looketh out at the window, And crieth through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why tarry the trampings of his chariots?</verse>
  <verse number="29">The wise amongst her ladies answer [her], Yea, she returneth answer to herself,</verse>
  <verse number="30">Have they not found, divided the booty, A damsel, two damsels, to each? A booty of dyed stuffs for Sisera, A booty of dyed stuffs of embroidery, Dyed stuff of double embroidery for the neck of a spoiler?</verse>
  <verse number="31">So let all thine enemies perish, Jehovah! But let them that love him be as the rising of the sun in its might. And the land had rest forty years.</verse>
