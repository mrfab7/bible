<p class="verse" data-verse="1">As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour beseemeth not a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As the sparrow for flitting about, as the swallow for flying, so a curse undeserved shall not come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the back of fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off [his own] feet, [and] drinketh damage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The legs of the lame hang loose; so is a proverb in the mouth of fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">As a bag of gems in a stoneheap, so is he that giveth honour to a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">[As] a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a proverb in the mouth of fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A master roughly worketh every one: he both hireth the fool and hireth passers-by.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">As a dog turneth back to its vomit, [so] a fool repeateth his folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Hast thou seen a man wise in his own eyes? There is more hope of a fool than of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The sluggard saith, There is a fierce lion in the way; a lion is in the midst of the streets!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">[As] the door turneth upon its hinges, so the sluggard upon his bed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The sluggard burieth his hand in the dish: it wearieth him to bring it again to his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven [men] that answer discreetly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He that passing by vexeth himself with strife belonging not to him, is [like] one that taketh a dog by the ears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">As a madman who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">so is a man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am I not in sport?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Where no wood is, the fire goeth out; and where there is no talebearer, the contention ceaseth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">[As] coals for hot coals, and wood for fire, so is a contentious man to inflame strife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The words of a talebearer are as dainty morsels, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Ardent lips, and a wicked heart, are [as] an earthen vessel overlaid with silver dross.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, but he layeth up deceit within him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">when his voice is gracious, believe him not, for there are seven abominations in his heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Though [his] hatred is covered by dissimulation, his wickedness shall be made manifest in the congregation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein; and he that rolleth a stone, it shall return upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A lying tongue hateth those that are injured by it, and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.</p>
