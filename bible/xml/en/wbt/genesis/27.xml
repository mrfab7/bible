  <verse number="1">And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest son, and said to him, My son: and he said to him, Behold, here am I.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;</verse>
  <verse number="4">And make me savory meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son; and Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak to Esau thy brother, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="7">Bring me venison, and make me savory meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD, before my death.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now therefore, my son, obey my voice, according to that which I command thee.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Go now to the flock, and bring me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savory meat for thy father, such as he loveth:</verse>
  <verse number="10">And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:</verse>
  <verse number="12">My father perhaps will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And his mother said to him, upon me be thy curse, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them to me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he went, and took, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savory meat, such as his father loved.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which was with her in the house, and put it upon Jacob her younger son:</verse>
  <verse number="16">And she put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands, and on the smooth part of his neck:</verse>
  <verse number="17">And she gave the savory meat, and the bread which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he came to his father, and said, My father: And he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Jacob said to his father, I am Esau thy first-born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Isaac said to his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Isaac said to Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou art my very son Esau, or not.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Jacob went near to Isaac his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands: So he blessed him.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he said, bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he ate: and he brought him wine, and he drank.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And his father Isaac said to him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:</verse>
  <verse number="28">Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:</verse>
  <verse number="29">Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee; be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob had yet scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And he also had made savory meat, and brought it to his father; and said to his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son’s venison, that thy soul may bless me.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And Isaac his father said to him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy first-born Esau.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And Isaac trembled exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceedingly bitter cry, and said to his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And he said, Is he not rightly named Jacob? for he hath supplanted me twice: he took away my birth-right; and behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?</verse>
  <verse number="37">And Isaac answered and said to Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now to thee, my son?</verse>
  <verse number="38">And Esau said to his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice, and wept.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And Isaac his father answered, and said to him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above;</verse>
  <verse number="40">And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother: and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And Esau hated Jacob, because of the blessing with which his father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah: and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as concerning thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Now therefore, my son, obey my voice: and arise, flee thou to Laban my brother to Haran;</verse>
  <verse number="44">And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother’s fury shall turn away;</verse>
  <verse number="45">Till thy brother’s anger shall turn away from thee, and he shall forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and bring thee from thence. Why should I be deprived also of you both in one day?</verse>
  <verse number="46">And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life, because of the daughters of Heth: if Jacob shall take a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these who are of the daughters of the land, what good will my life do me?</verse>
