<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I speak the truth in Christ; I am not lying, as confirmed by my conscience in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I have deep sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my own flesh and blood,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">the people of Israel. Theirs is the adoption as sons; theirs the divine glory and the covenants; theirs the giving of the law, the temple worship, and the promises.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Theirs are the patriarchs, and from them proceeds the human descent of Christ, who is God over all, forever worthy of praise! Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">It is not as though God’s word has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel are Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Nor because they are Abraham’s descendants are they all his children. On the contrary, “Through Isaac your offspring will be reckoned.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">So it is not the children of the flesh who are God’s children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as offspring.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For this is what the promise stated: “At the appointed time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Not only that, but Rebecca’s children were conceived by one man, our father Isaac.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Yet before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad, in order that God’s plan of election might stand,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">not by works but by Him who calls, she was told, “The older will serve the younger.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">So it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Certainly not!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For He says to Moses: “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">So then, it does not depend on man’s desire or effort, but on God’s mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: “I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display My power in you, and that My name might be proclaimed in all the earth.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Therefore God has mercy on whom He wants to have mercy, and He hardens whom He wants to harden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">One of you will say to me, “Then why does God still find fault? For who can resist His will?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? Shall what is formed say to Him who formed it, “Why did You make me like this?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Does not the potter have the right to make from the same lump of clay one vessel for special occasions and another for common use?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">What if God, intending to show His wrath and make His power known, bore with great patience the vessels of His wrath, prepared for destruction?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">What if He did this to make the riches of His glory known to the vessels of His mercy, whom He prepared in advance for glory—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">including us, whom He has called not only from the Jews, but also from the Gentiles?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">As He says in Hosea: “I will call them ‘My People’ who are not My people, and I will call her ‘My Beloved’ who is not My beloved,”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">and, “It will happen that in the very place where it was said to them, ‘You are not My people,’ they will be called ‘sons of the living God.’”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Though the number of the Israelites is like the sand of the sea, only the remnant will be saved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For the Lord will carry out His sentence on the earth thoroughly and decisively.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">It is just as Isaiah foretold: “Unless the Lord of Hosts had left us descendants, we would have become like Sodom, we would have resembled Gomorrah.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">What then will we say? That the Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained it, a righteousness that is by faith;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">but Israel, who pursued a law of righteousness, has not attained it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Why not? Because their pursuit was not by faith, but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">as it is written: “See, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense; and the one who believes in Him will never be put to shame.”</p>
