<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Having, then, these promises, beloved, may we cleanse ourselves from every pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting sanctification in the fear of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">receive us; no one did we wrong; no one did we waste; no one did we defraud;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">not to condemn you do I say it, for I have said before that in our hearts ye are to die with and to live with;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">great is my freedom of speech unto you, great my glory on your behalf; I have been filled with the comfort, I overabound with the joy on all our tribulation,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">for also we, having come to Macedonia, no relaxation hath our flesh had, but on every side we are in tribulation, without are fightings, within—fears;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">but He who is comforting the cast-down—God—He did comfort us in the presence of Titus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and not only in his presence, but also in the comfort with which he was comforted over you, declaring to us your longing desire, your lamentation, your zeal for me, so that the more I did rejoice,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">because even if I made you sorry in the letter, I do not repent—if even I did repent—for I perceive that the letter, even if for an hour, did make you sorry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I now do rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye were made sorry to reformation, for ye were made sorry toward God, that in nothing ye might receive damage from us;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">for the sorrow toward God reformation to salvation not to be repented of doth work, and the sorrow of the world doth work death,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">for, lo, this same thing—your being made sorry toward God—how much diligence it doth work in you! but defence, but displeasure, but fear, but longing desire, but zeal, but revenge; in every thing ye did approve yourselves to be pure in the matter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If, then, I also wrote to you—not for his cause who did wrong, nor for his cause who did suffer wrong, but for our diligence in your behalf being manifested unto you before God—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">because of this we have been comforted in your comfort, and more abundantly the more did we rejoice in the joy of Titus, that his spirit hath been refreshed from you all;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">because if anything to him in your behalf I have boasted, I was not put to shame; but as all things in truth we did speak to you, so also our boasting before Titus became truth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">and his tender affection is more abundantly toward you, remembering the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye did receive him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I rejoice, therefore, that in everything I have courage in you.</p>
