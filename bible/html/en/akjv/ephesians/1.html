<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">According as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Having predestinated us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has made us accepted in the beloved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Having made known to us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">That in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">In whom you also trusted, after that you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that you believed, you were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Why I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love to all the saints,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And has put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Which is his body, the fullness of him that fills all in all.</p>
