  <verse number="1">And Abijah will lie down with his fathers, and they will bury him in the city of David: and Asa his son will reign in his stead. In his days the land rested ten years.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Asa will do the good and the straight in the eyes of Jehovah his God:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he will remove the altars of the stranger, and the heights, and break the pillars, and cut down the images:</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he will say to Judah to seek Jehovah the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commands.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he will remove from all the cities of Judah the heights and the images: and the kingdom will rest before him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he will build cities of fortification in Judah: for the land rested, and not with him war in these years; for Jehovah gave rest to him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he will say to Judah, We will build these cities, and surround a wall, and towers, doors and bars, and the land yet before us: for we sought Jehovah our God, and he will give to us rest from round about And they will build and prosper.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And there will be to Asa an army lifting up the shield and spear, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and from Benjamin lifting up the shield and bending the bow, two hundred and eighty thousand: all these strong of power.</verse>

  <verse number="11">And Asa will call to Jehovah his God, and he will say, O Jehovah, nothing with thee to help between many to those of no power: help us, O Jehovah our God, for upon thee we relied, and in thy name we came against this multitude. O Jehovah, thou our God; man shall not detain with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Jehovah will smite the Cushites before Asa, and before Judah; and the Cushites will flee.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Asa will pursue them, and the people which were with him, even to the lodging-place: and there will fall from the Cushites to nothing being to them, for they were broken before Jehovah, and before his camp; and they will lift up exceeding much spoil.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And they will strike all the cities round about the lodging-place; for the fear of Jehovah was upon them: and they will plunder all the cities; for much plunder was in them.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And also tents of cattle they struck, and they will turn back sheep for multitude, and camels; and they will turn back to Jerusalem.</verse>
