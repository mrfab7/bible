  <verse number="1">The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Even as it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, Who shall prepare thy way;</verse>
  <verse number="3">The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make ye ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight;</verse>
  <verse number="4">John came, who baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance unto remission of sins.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And there went out unto him all the country of Judaea, and all they of Jerusalem; and they were baptized of him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and had a leathern girdle about his loins, and did eat locusts and wild honey.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he preached, saying, There cometh after me he that is mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I baptized you with water; but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in the Jordan.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens rent asunder, and the Spirit as a dove descending upon him:</verse>
  <verse number="11">And a voice came out of the heavens, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And straightway the Spirit driveth him forth into the wilderness.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he was in the wilderness forty days tempted of Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Now after that John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,</verse>
  <verse number="15">and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe in the gospel.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea: for they were fishers.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And straightway they left the nets, and followed him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And going on a little further, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they go into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And they were astonished at his teaching: for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And straightway there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</verse>
  <verse number="24">saying, What have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the unclean spirit, tearing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? a new teaching! with authority he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the report of him went out straightway everywhere into all the region of Galilee round about.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And straightway, when they were come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Now Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever; and straightway they tell him of her:</verse>
  <verse number="31">and he came and took her by the hand, and raised her up; and the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were sick, and them that were possessed with devils.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And all the city was gathered together at the door.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And he healed many that were sick with divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and he suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And Simon and they that were with him followed after him;</verse>
  <verse number="37">and they found him, and say unto him, All are seeking thee.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And he saith unto them, Let us go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also; for to this end came I forth.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And he went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out devils.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And there cometh to him a leper, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou made clean.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And straightway the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And he strictly charged him, and straightway sent him out,</verse>
  <verse number="44">and saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</verse>
  <verse number="45">But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to spread abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</verse>
