<p class="verse" data-verse="1">How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince’s daughter! the joints of thy thighs [are] like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thy navel [is like] a round goblet, [which] wanteth not liquor: thy belly [is like] an heap of wheat set about with lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thy two breasts [are] like two young roes [that are] twins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thy neck [is] as a tower of ivory; thine eyes [like] the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose [is] as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thine head upon thee [is] like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king [is] held in the galleries.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters [of grapes].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth [down] sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I [am] my beloved’s, and his desire [is] toward me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, [whether] the tender grape appear, [and] the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates [are] all manner of pleasant [fruits], new and old, [which] I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.</p>
