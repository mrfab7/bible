<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now faith is [the] substantiating of things hoped for, [the] conviction of things not seen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For in [the power of] this the elders have obtained testimony.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">By faith we apprehend that the worlds were framed by [the] word of God, so that that which is seen should not take its origin from things which appear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained testimony of being righteous, God bearing testimony to his gifts, and by it, having died, he yet speaks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death; and was not found, because God had translated him; for before [his] translation he has the testimony that he had pleased God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But without faith [it is] impossible to please [him]. For he that draws near to God must believe that he is, and [that] he is a rewarder of them who seek him out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">By faith, Noah, oracularly warned concerning things not yet seen, moved with fear, prepared an ark for the saving of his house; by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which [is] according to faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">By faith Abraham, being called, obeyed to go out into the place which he was to receive for an inheritance, and went out, not knowing where he was going.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">By faith he sojourned as a stranger in the land of promise as a foreign country, having dwelt in tents with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with [him] of the same promise;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">for he waited for the city which has foundations, of which God is [the] artificer and constructor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">By faith also Sarah herself received strength for [the] conception of seed, and [that] beyond a seasonable age; since she counted him faithful who promised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Wherefore also there have been born of one, and that of one become dead, even as the stars of heaven in multitude, and as the countless sand which [is] by the sea shore.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">All these died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them from afar off and embraced [them], and confessed that they were strangers and sojourners on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For they who say such things shew clearly that they seek [their] country.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And if they had called to mind that from whence they went out, they had had opportunity to have returned;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">but now they seek a better, that is, a heavenly; wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God; for he has prepared for them a city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">By faith Abraham, [when] tried, offered up Isaac, and he who had received to himself the promises offered up his only begotten [son],</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">as to whom it had been said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">counting that God [was] able to raise [him] even from among [the] dead, whence also he received him in a figure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">By faith Jacob [when] dying blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshipped on the top of his staff.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">By faith Joseph [when] dying called to mind the going forth of the sons of Israel, and gave commandment concerning his bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">By faith Moses, being born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw the child beautiful; and they did not fear the injunction of the king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">By faith Moses, when he had become great, refused to be called son of Pharaoh’s daughter;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">choosing rather to suffer affliction along with the people of God than to have [the] temporary pleasure of sin;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">esteeming the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt, for he had respect to the recompense.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he persevered, as seeing him who is invisible.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">By faith he celebrated the passover and the sprinkling of the blood, that the destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">By faith they passed through the Red sea as through dry land; of which the Egyptians having made trial were swallowed up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">By faith the walls of Jericho fell, having been encircled for seven days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with the unbelieving, having received the spies in peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And what more do I say? For the time would fail me telling of Gideon, and Barak, and Samson, and Jephthah, and David and Samuel, and of the prophets:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">who by faith overcame kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped lions’ mouths,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">quenched [the] power of fire, escaped [the] edge of the sword, became strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, made [the] armies of strangers give way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Women received their dead again by resurrection; and others were tortured, not having accepted deliverance, that they might get a better resurrection;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">and others underwent trial of mockings and scourgings, yea, and of bonds and imprisonment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">They were stoned, were sawn asunder, were tempted, died by the death of the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, destitute, afflicted, evil treated,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">(of whom the world was not worthy,) wandering in deserts and mountains, and [in] dens and caverns of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And these all, having obtained witness through faith, did not receive the promise,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">God having foreseen some better thing for us, that they should not be made perfect without us.</p>
