<chapter book="2 Samuel" number="7" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;</verse>
  <verse number="2">That the king said to Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in your heart; for the LORD is with you.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Go and tell my servant David, Thus said the LORD, Shall you build me an house for me to dwell in?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Whereas I have not dwelled in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.</verse>
  <verse number="7">In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spoke I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build you not me an house of cedar?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now therefore so shall you say to my servant David, Thus said the LORD of hosts, I took you from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:</verse>
  <verse number="9">And I was with you wherever you went, and have cut off all your enemies out of your sight, and have made you a great name, like to the name of the great men that are in the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,</verse>
  <verse number="11">And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused you to rest from all your enemies. Also the LORD tells you that he will make you an house.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And when your days be fulfilled, and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, which shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He shall build an house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:</verse>
  <verse number="15">But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before you.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And your house and your kingdom shall be established for ever before you: your throne shall be established for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="17">According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak to David.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that you have brought me till now?</verse>
  <verse number="19">And this was yet a small thing in your sight, O Lord GOD; but you have spoken also of your servant’s house for a great while to come. And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?</verse>
  <verse number="20">And what can David say more to you? for you, Lord GOD, know your servant.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For your word’s sake, and according to your own heart, have you done all these great things, to make your servant know them.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Why you are great, O LORD God: for there is none like you, neither is there any God beside you, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And what one nation in the earth is like your people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for your land, before your people, which you redeemed to you from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?</verse>
  <verse number="24">For you have confirmed to yourself your people Israel to be a people to you for ever: and you, LORD, are become their God.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And now, O LORD God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as you have said.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And let your name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of your servant David be established before you.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For you, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed to your servant, saying, I will build you an house: therefore has your servant found in his heart to pray this prayer to you.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And now, O Lord GOD, you are that God, and your words be true, and you have promised this goodness to your servant:</verse>
  <verse number="29">Therefore now let it please you to bless the house of your servant, that it may continue for ever before you: for you, O Lord GOD, have spoken it: and with your blessing let the house of your servant be blessed for ever.</verse>
