  <verse number="1">AND Jesus went unto mount Olivet.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him, and sitting down he taught them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the scribes and the Pharisees bring unto him a woman taken in adultery: and they set her in the midst,</verse>
  <verse number="4">And said to him: Master, this woman was even now taken in adultery.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now Moses in the law commanded us to stone such a one. But what sayest thou?</verse>
  <verse number="6">And this they said tempting him, that they might accuse him. But Jesus bowing himself down, wrote with his finger on the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="7">When therefore they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said to them: He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And again stooping down, he wrote on the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But they hearing this, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest. And Jesus alone remained, and the woman standing in the midst.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then Jesus lifting up himself, said to her: Woman, where are they that accused thee? Hath no man condemned thee?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Who said: No man, Lord. And Jesus said: Neither will I condemn thee. Go, and now sin no more.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Again therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying: I am the light of the world: he that followeth me, walketh not in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The Pharisees therefore said to him: Thou givest testimony of thyself: thy testimony is not true.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Jesus answered, and said to them: Although I give testimony of myself, my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go: but you know not whence I come, or whither I go.</verse>
  <verse number="15">You judge according to the flesh: I judge not any man.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And if I do judge, my judgment is true: because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And in your law it is written, that the testimony of two men is true.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I am one that give testimony of myself: and the Father that sent me giveth testimony of me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">They said therefore to him: Where is thy Father? Jesus answered: Neither me do you know, nor my Father: if you did know me, perhaps you would know my Father also.</verse>
  <verse number="20">These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, teaching in the temple: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Again therefore Jesus said to them: I go, and you shall seek me, and you shall die in your sin. Whither I go, you cannot come.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The Jews therefore said: Will he kill himself, because he said: Whither I go, you cannot come?</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he said to them: You are from beneath, I am from above. You are of this world, I am not of this world.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore I said to you, that you shall die in your sins. For if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sin.</verse>
  <verse number="25">They said therefore to him: Who art thou? Jesus said to them: The beginning, who also speak unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Many things I have to speak and to judge of you. But he that sent me, is true: and the things I have heard of him, these same I speak in the world.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And they understood not, that he called God his Father.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Jesus therefore said to them: When you shall have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know, that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father hath taught me, these things I speak:</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he that sent me, is with me, and he hath not left me alone: for I do always the things that please him.</verse>
  <verse number="30">When he spoke these things, many believed in him.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Then Jesus said to those Jews, who believed him: If you continue in my word, you shall be my disciples indeed.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</verse>
  <verse number="33">They answered him: We are the seed of Abraham, and we have never been slaves to any man: how sayest thou: you shall be free?</verse>
  <verse number="34">Jesus answered them: Amen, amen I say unto you: that whosoever committeth sin, is the servant of sin.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Now the servant abideth not in the house for ever; but the son abideth for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="36">If therefore the son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.</verse>
  <verse number="37">I know that you are the children of Abraham: but you seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</verse>
  <verse number="38">I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do the things that you have seen with your father.</verse>
  <verse number="39">They answered, and said to him: Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them: If you be the children of Abraham, do the works of Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="40">But now you seek to kill me, a man who have spoken the truth to you, which I have heard of God. This Abraham did not.</verse>
  <verse number="41">You do the works of your father. They said therefore to him: We are not born of fornication: we have one Father, even God.</verse>
  <verse number="42">Jesus therefore said to them: If God were your Father, you would indeed love me. For from God I proceeded, and came; for I came not of myself, but he sent me:</verse>
  <verse number="43">Why do you not know my speech? Because you cannot hear my word.</verse>
  <verse number="44">You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and he stood not in the truth; because truth is not in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="45">But if I say the truth, you believe me not.</verse>
  <verse number="46">Which of you shall convince me of sin? If I say the truth to you, why do you not believe me?</verse>
  <verse number="47">He that is of God, heareth the words of God. Therefore you hear them not, because you are not of God.</verse>
  <verse number="48">The Jews therefore answered, and said to him: Do not we say well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</verse>
  <verse number="49">Jesus answered: I have not a devil: but I honour my Father, and you have dishonoured me.</verse>
  <verse number="50">But I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</verse>
  <verse number="51">Amen, amen I say to you: If any man keep my word, he shall not see death for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="52">The Jews therefore said: Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest: If any man keep my word, he shall not taste death for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="53">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? and the prophets are dead. Whom dost thou make thyself?</verse>
  <verse number="54">Jesus answered: If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father that glorifieth me, of whom you say that he is your God.</verse>
  <verse number="55">And you have not known him, but I know him. And if I shall say that I know him not, I shall be like to you, a liar. But I do know him, and do keep his word.</verse>
  <verse number="56">Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see my day: he saw it, and was glad.</verse>
  <verse number="57">The Jews therefore said to him: Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</verse>
  <verse number="58">Jesus said to them: Amen, amen I say to you, before Abraham was made, I am.</verse>
  <verse number="59">They took up stones therefore to cast at him. But Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.</verse>
