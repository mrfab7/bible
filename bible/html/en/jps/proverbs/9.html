<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wisdom hath builded her house, She hath hewn out her seven pillars;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">She hath prepared her meat, she hath mingled her wine; She hath also furnished her table.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">She hath sent forth her maidens, she calleth, Upon the highest places of the city:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Whoso is thoughtless, let him turn in hither’; As for him that lacketh understanding, she saith to him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Come, eat of my bread, And drink of the wine which I have mingled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Forsake all thoughtlessness, and live; And walk in the way of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He that correcteth a scorner getteth to himself shame, And he that reproveth a wicked man, it becometh unto him a blot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee; Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Give to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser; Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, And the knowledge of the All-holy is understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For by me thy days shall be multiplied, And the years of thy life shall be increased.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself; And if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The woman Folly is riotous; She is thoughtless, and knoweth nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And she sitteth at the door of her house, On a seat in the high places of the city,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">To call to them that pass by, Who go right on their ways:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Whoso is thoughtless, let him turn in hither’; And as for him that lacketh understanding, she saith to him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Stolen waters are sweet, And bread eaten in secret is pleasant.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But he knoweth not that the shades are there; That her guests are in the depths of the nether-world.</p>
