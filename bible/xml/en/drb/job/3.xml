<chapter book="Job" number="3" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">After this Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and he said:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said: A man child is conceived.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Let that day be turned into darkness, let not God regard it from above, and let not the light shine upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Let darkness, and the shadow of death cover it, let a mist overspread it, and let it be wrapped up in bitterness.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Let a darksome whirlwind seize upon that night, let it not be counted in the days of the year, nor numbered in the months.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Let that night be solitary, and not worthy of praise.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Let them curse it who curse the day. who are ready to raise up a leviathan:</verse>
  <verse number="9">Let the stars be darkened with the mist thereof: let it expect light and not see it, nor the rising of the dawning of the day:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Because it shut not up the doors of the womb that bore me, nor took away evils from my eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Why did I not die in the womb, why did I not perish when I came out of the belly?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Why received upon the knees? why suckled at the breasts ?</verse>
  <verse number="13">For now I should have been asleep and still, and should have rest in my sleep.</verse>
  <verse number="14">With kings and consuls of the earth, who build themselves solitudes:</verse>
  <verse number="15">Or with princes, that possess gold, and All their houses with silver:</verse>
  <verse number="16">Or as a hidden untimely birth I should not be, or as they that being conceived have not seen the light.</verse>
  <verse number="17">There the wicked cease from tumult, and there the wearied in strength are at rest.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And they sometime bound together without disquiet, have not heard the voice of the oppressor.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The small and great are there, and the servant is free from his master.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to them that are in bitterness of soul?</verse>
  <verse number="21">That look for death, and it cometh not, as they that dig for a treasure:</verse>
  <verse number="22">And they rejoice exceedingly when they have found the grave.</verse>
  <verse number="23">To a man whose way is hidden, and God hath surrounded him with darkness?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Before I eat I sigh: and as overflowing waters, so is my roaring:</verse>
  <verse number="25">For the fear which I feared hath come upon me: and that which I was afraid of, hath befallen me.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Have I not dissembled ? have I not kept silence ? have I not been quiet? and indignation is come upon me.</verse>
