  <verse number="1">Now I Paul myself beseech you, by the mildness and modesty of Christ, who in presence indeed am lowly among you, but being absent, am bold toward you.</verse>
  <verse number="2">But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present, with that confidence wherewith I am thought to be bold, against some, who reckon us as if we walked according to the flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty to God unto the pulling down of fortifications, destroying counsels,</verse>
  <verse number="5">And every height that exhalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every understanding unto the obedience of Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="6">And having in readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience shall be fulfilled.</verse>
  <verse number="7">See the things that are according to outward appearance. If any man trust to himself, that he is Christ’s, let him think this again with himself, that as he is Christ’s, so are we also.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For if also I should boast somewhat more of our power, which the Lord hath given us unto edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But that I may not be thought as it were to terrify you by epistles,</verse>
  <verse number="10">(For his epistles indeed, say they, are weighty and strong; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible,)</verse>
  <verse number="11">Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by epistles, when absent, such also we will be indeed when present.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For we dare not match, or compare ourselves with some, that commend themselves; but we measure ourselves by ourselves, and compare ourselves with ourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But we will not glory beyond our measure; but according to the measure of the rule, which God hath measured to us, a measure to reach even unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as if we reached not unto you. For we are come as far as to you in the gospel of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Not glorying beyond measure in other men’s labours; but having hope of your increasing faith, to be magnified in you according to our rule abundantly;</verse>
  <verse number="16">Yea, unto those places that are beyond you, to preach the gospel, not to glory in another man’s rule, in those things that are made ready to our hand.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For not he who commendeth himself, is approved, but he, whom God commendeth.</verse>
