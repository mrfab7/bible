<chapter book="Ezekiel" number="13" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy, and say thou unto them that prophesy out of their own heart, Hear ye the word of the LORD;</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thus saith the Lord GOD: Woe unto the foolish prophets, that follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing!</verse>
  <verse number="4">O Israel, thy prophets have been like foxes in the waste places.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the fence for the house of Israel, to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="6">They have seen vanity and lying divination, that say, The LORD saith; and the LORD hath not sent them: and they have made men to hope that the word should be confirmed.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Have ye not seen a vain vision, and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The LORD saith; albeit I have not spoken?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And mine hand shall be against the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the council of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there is no peace; and when one buildeth up a wall, behold, they daub it with untempered mortar:</verse>
  <verse number="11">say unto them which daub it with untempered mortar, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and ye, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Lo, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed it?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in mine anger, and great hailstones in fury to consume it.</verse>
  <verse number="14">So will I break down the wall that ye have daubed with untempered mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered: and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thus will I accomplish my fury upon the wall, and upon them that have daubed it with untempered mortar; and I will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;</verse>
  <verse number="16">to wit, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy thou against them,</verse>
  <verse number="18">and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Woe to the women that sew pillows upon all elbows, and make kerchiefs for the head of persons of every stature to hunt souls! will ye hunt the souls of my people, and save souls alive for yourselves?</verse>
  <verse number="19">And ye have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hearken unto lies.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, I am against your pillows, wherewith ye there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms; and I will let the souls go, even the souls that ye hunt to make them fly.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Because with lies ye have grieved the heart of the righteous, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, and be saved alive:</verse>
  <verse number="23">therefore ye shall no more see vanity, nor divine divinations: and I will deliver my people out of your hand; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
