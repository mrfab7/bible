  <verse number="1">Surely there is a mine for silver, And a place for gold which they refine.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Iron is taken out of the earth, And copper is molten out of the stone.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Man setteth an end to darkness, And searcheth out, to the furthest bound, The stones of obscurity and of thick darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He breaketh open a shaft away from where men sojourn; They are forgotten of the foot; They hang afar from men, they swing to and fro.</verse>
  <verse number="5">As for the earth, out of it cometh bread; And underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The stones thereof are the place of sapphires, And it hath dust of gold.</verse>
  <verse number="7">That path no bird of prey knoweth, Neither hath the falcon’s eye seen it:</verse>
  <verse number="8">The proud beasts have not trodden it, Nor hath the fierce lion passed thereby.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock; He overturneth the mountains by the roots.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He cutteth out channels among the rocks; And his eye seeth every precious thing.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He bindeth the streams that they trickle not; And the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Man knoweth not the price thereof; Neither is it found in the land of the living.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The deep saith, It is not in me; And the sea saith, It is not with me.</verse>
  <verse number="15">It cannot be gotten for gold, Neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="16">It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, With the precious onyx, or the sapphire.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Gold and glass cannot equal it, Neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.</verse>
  <verse number="18">No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal: Yea, the price of wisdom is above rubies.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, Neither shall it be valued with pure gold.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Whence then cometh wisdom? And where is the place of understanding?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, And kept close from the birds of the heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Destruction and Death say, We have heard a rumor thereof with our ears.</verse>
  <verse number="23">God understandeth the way thereof, And he knoweth the place thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For he looketh to the ends of the earth, And seeth under the whole heaven;</verse>
  <verse number="25">To make a weight for the wind: Yea, he meteth out the waters by measure.</verse>
  <verse number="26">When he made a decree for the rain, And a way for the lightning of the thunder;</verse>
  <verse number="27">Then did he see it, and declare it; He established it, yea, and searched it out.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; And to depart from evil is understanding.</verse>
