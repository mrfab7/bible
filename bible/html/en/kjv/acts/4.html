<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they laid hands on them, and put [them] in hold unto the next day: for it was now eventide.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have ye done this?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, [even] by him doth this man stand here before you whole.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them [is] manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny [it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for all [men] glorified God for that which was done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shewed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, thou [art] God, which hast made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Who by the mouth of thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">By stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any [of them] that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And laid [them] down at the apostles’ feet: and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, [and] of the country of Cyprus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Having land, sold [it], and brought the money, and laid [it] at the apostles’ feet.</p>
