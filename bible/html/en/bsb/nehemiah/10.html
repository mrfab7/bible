<p class="verse" data-verse="28">“The rest of the people—the priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, temple servants, and all who had separated themselves from the people of the land to obey the Law of God—along with their wives and all their sons and daughters who are able to understand,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">hereby join with their noble brothers and commit themselves with a sworn oath to follow the Law of God given through His servant Moses and to obey carefully all the commandments, ordinances, and statutes of the LORD our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">We will not give our daughters in marriage to the people of the land, and we will not take their daughters for our sons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">When the people of the land bring merchandise or any kind of grain to sell on the Sabbath day, we will not buy from them on a Sabbath or holy day. Every seventh year we will let the fields lie fallow and will cancel every debt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">We also place ourselves under the obligation to contribute a third of a shekel yearly for the service of the house of our God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">for the showbread, for the regular grain offerings and burnt offerings, for the Sabbath offerings, for the New Moons and appointed feasts, for the holy offerings, for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the duties of the house of our God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">We have cast lots among the priests, Levites, and people for the donation of wood by our families at the appointed times each year. They are to bring it to the house of our God to burn on the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the Law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">We will also bring the firstfruits of our land and of every fruit tree to the house of the LORD year by year.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And we will bring the firstborn of our sons and our livestock, as it is written in the Law, and will bring the firstborn of our herds and flocks to the house of our God, to the priests who minister in the house of our God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Moreover, we will bring to the priests at the storerooms of the house of our God the firstfruits of our dough, of our grain offerings, of the fruit of all our trees, and of our new wine and oil. A tenth of our produce belongs to the Levites, so that they shall receive tithes in all the towns where we labor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">A priest of Aaron’s line is to accompany the Levites when they collect the tenth, and the Levites are to bring a tenth of these tithes to the storerooms of the treasury in the house of our God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">For the Israelites and the Levites are to bring the contributions of grain, new wine, and oil to the storerooms where the articles of the sanctuary are kept and where the ministering priests, the gatekeepers, and the singers stay. Thus we will not neglect the house of our God.”</p>
