<p class="verse" data-verse="1">At this also my heart trembles, and is moved out of his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goes out of his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He directs it under the whole heaven, and his lightning to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">After it a voice roars: he thunders with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">God thunders marvelously with his voice; great things does he, which we cannot comprehend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For he said to the snow, Be you on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He seals up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Out of the south comes the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Also by watering he wearies the thick cloud: he scatters his bright cloud:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatever he commands them on the face of the world in the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He causes it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Listen to this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Do you know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Do you know the balancing of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">How your garments are warm, when he quiets the earth by the south wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Have you with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Teach us what we shall say to him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passes, and cleans them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Fair weather comes out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Men do therefore fear him: he respects not any that are wise of heart.</p>
