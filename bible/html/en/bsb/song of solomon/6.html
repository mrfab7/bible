<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Which way has he turned? We will seek him with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to pasture his flock in the gardens and to gather lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I belong to my beloved and he belongs to me; he pastures his flock among the lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">You are as beautiful, my darling, as Tirzah, as lovely as Jerusalem, as majestic as troops with banners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Turn your eyes away from me, for they have overcome me. Your hair is like a flock of goats streaming down from Gilead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Your teeth are like a flock of sheep coming up from the washing; each has its twin, and not one of them is lost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Your brow behind your veil is like a slice of pomegranate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and maidens without number,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">but my dove, my perfect one, is unique, the favorite of the mother who bore her. The maidens see her and call her blessed; the queens and concubines sing her praises.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who is this who shines like the dawn, as fair as the moon, as bright as the sun, as majestic as the stars in procession?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I went down to the walnut grove to see the blossoms of the valley, to see if the vines were budding or the pomegranates were in bloom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Before I realized it, my desire had set me among the royal chariots of my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Come back, come back, O Shulammite! Come back, come back, that we may gaze upon you. Why do you look at the Shulammite, as on the dance of Mahanaim?</p>
