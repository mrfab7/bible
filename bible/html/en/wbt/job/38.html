<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who hath laid the measures of it, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Upon what are the foundations of it fastened? or who laid its corner stone;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">When I made a cloud its garment, and thick darkness a swaddling band for it,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And broke up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the day-spring to know its place;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">That it might take hold of the ends of earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And from the wicked their light is withheld, and the high arm shall be broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Have the gates of death been opened to thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shades of death?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is its place,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">That thou shouldest take it to its bound, and that thou shouldest know the paths to its house?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness in which there is no man;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of the dew?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in its season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with its sons?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set its dominion on the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Canst thou lift thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say to thee, Here we are?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry to God, they wander for want of food.</p>
