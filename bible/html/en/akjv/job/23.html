<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">On the left hand, where he does work, but I cannot behold him: he hides himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But he knows the way that I take: when he has tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My foot has held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desires, even that he does.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For he performes the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For God makes my heart soft, and the Almighty troubles me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither has he covered the darkness from my face.</p>
