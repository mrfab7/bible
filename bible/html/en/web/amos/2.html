<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Thus says Yahweh: “For three transgressions of Moab, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">but I will send a fire on Moab, and it will devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab will die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and I will cut off the judge from their midst, and will kill all its princes with him,” says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thus says Yahweh: “For three transgressions of Judah, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because they have rejected Yahweh’s law, and have not kept his statutes, and their lies have led them astray, after which their fathers walked;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But I will send a fire on Judah, and it will devour the palaces of Jerusalem.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thus says Yahweh: “For three transgressions of Israel, yes, for four, I will not turn away its punishment; because they have sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They trample on the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and deny justice to the oppressed; and a man and his father use the same maiden, to profane my holy name;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">and they lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes taken in pledge; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who have been fined.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I raised up some of your sons for prophets, and some of your young men for Nazirites. Isn’t this true, you children of Israel?” says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">“But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, ‘Don’t prophesy!’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Behold, I will crush you in your place, as a cart crushes that is full of grain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Flight will perish from the swift; and the strong won’t strengthen his force; neither shall the mighty deliver himself;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">neither shall he stand who handles the bow; and he who is swift of foot won’t escape; neither shall he who rides the horse deliver himself;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">and he who is courageous among the mighty will flee away naked on that day,” says Yahweh.</p>
