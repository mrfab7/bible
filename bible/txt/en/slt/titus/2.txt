1	And do thou speak what becomes sound doctrine:
2	The aged men to be sober, grave, of sound mind, sound in the faith, in love, in patience.
3	The aged women likewise, becoming holy in a serene state of mind, not accusers, not slaves to much wine, teachers of good;
4	That they render the young women discreet, to be lovers of the husband, lovers of the children,
5	Of sound mind chaste, remaining at home, good subordinates to their own husbands, that the word of God be not defamed.
6	The younger men likewise beseech to be of sound mind.
7	Concerning all things hold thyself a type of good works: in doctrine, integrity, gravity, incorruptibility,
8	The word sound, not to be condemned; that he from the opposite may be changed, having nothing bad to say of you.
9	Servants to be subordinate to their own masters, to be pleasing in all things; not contradicting;
10	Not purloining, but showing all good faith; that they may adorn the doctrine of the Saviour our God in all things.
11	For the grace of God who saves, was manifested to all men,
12	Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and eager worldly desires, we should live discreetly, and justly, and religiously, in the time now;
13	Expecting the blessed hope, and appearance of the glory of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
14	Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify to himself a distinguished people, zealous of good works.
15	These things speak, and beseech, and reprove with all order. Let none despise thee.
