  <verse number="1">And it came to pass, that, as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said to him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he said to them, When you pray, say, Our Father which are in heaven, Hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done, as in heaven, so in earth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Give us day by day our daily bread.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And forgive us our sins; for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he said to them, Which of you shall have a friend, and shall go to him at midnight, and say to him, Friend, lend me three loaves;</verse>
  <verse number="6">For a friend of my in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give you.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I say to you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needs.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And I say to you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For every one that asks receives; and he that seeks finds; and to him that knocks it shall be opened.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?</verse>
  <verse number="13">If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spoke; and the people wondered.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But some of them said, He casts out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and a house divided against a house falls.</verse>
  <verse number="18">If Satan also be divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because you say that I cast out devils through Beelzebub.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But if I with the finger of God cast out devils, no doubt the kingdom of God is come on you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">When a strong man armed keeps his palace, his goods are in peace:</verse>
  <verse number="22">But when a stronger than he shall come on him, and overcome him, he takes from him all his armor wherein he trusted, and divides his spoils.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathers not with me scatters.</verse>
  <verse number="24">When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he said, I will return to my house from where I came out.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And when he comes, he finds it swept and garnished.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Then goes he, and takes to him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in, and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And it came to pass, as he spoke these things, a certain woman of the company lifted up her voice, and said to him, Blessed is the womb that bore you, and the breasts which you have sucked.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But he said, Yes rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And when the people were gathered thick together, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign; and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For as Jonas was a sign to the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.</verse>
  <verse number="31">The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with the men of this generation, and condemn them: for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.</verse>
  <verse number="32">The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.</verse>
  <verse number="33">No man, when he has lighted a candle, puts it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a candlestick, that they which come in may see the light.</verse>
  <verse number="34">The light of the body is the eye: therefore when your eye is single, your whole body also is full of light; but when your eye is evil, your body also is full of darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Take heed therefore that the light which is in you be not darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="36">If your whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle does give you light.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And as he spoke, a certain Pharisee sought him to dine with him: and he went in, and sat down to meat.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And when the Pharisee saw it, he marveled that he had not first washed before dinner.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And the Lord said to him, Now do you Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.</verse>
  <verse number="40">You fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?</verse>
  <verse number="41">But rather give alms of such things as you have; and, behold, all things are clean to you.</verse>
  <verse number="42">But woe to you, Pharisees! for you tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Woe to you, Pharisees! for you love the uppermost seats in the synagogues, and greetings in the markets.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Then answered one of the lawyers, and said to him, Master, thus saying you reproach us also.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And he said, Woe to you also, you lawyers! for you lade men with burdens grievous to be borne, and you yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.</verse>
  <verse number="47">Woe to you! for you build the sepulchers of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.</verse>
  <verse number="48">Truly you bear witness that you allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and you build their sepulchers.</verse>
  <verse number="49">Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute:</verse>
  <verse number="50">That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation of the world, may be required of this generation;</verse>
  <verse number="51">From the blood of Abel to the blood of Zacharias which perished between the altar and the temple: truly I say to you, It shall be required of this generation.</verse>
  <verse number="52">Woe to you, lawyers! for you have taken away the key of knowledge: you entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in you hindered.</verse>
  <verse number="53">And as he said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many things:</verse>
  <verse number="54">Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, that they might accuse him.</verse>
