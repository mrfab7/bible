<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Joshua will gather together all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and he will call for the old men of Israel, and for the heads, and for the judges, and for the scribes; and they will stand before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Joshua will say to all the people, So said Jehovah the God of Israel, Your fathers dwelt beyond the river from everlasting time, Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor and they will serve other gods.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I will take your father Abraham from beyond the river, and I will lead him into all the land of Canaan, and I will multiply his seed and I will give to him Isaak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I will give to Isaak, Jacob and Esau: and I will give to Esau mount Seir, to possess it; and Jacob and his sons will go down to Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And I will send Moses and Aaron, and I will strike Egypt as I did in its midst: and afterwards I will bring you out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And I will bring out your fathers from Egypt; and ye shall come to the sea: and the Egyptians will pursue after your fathers with chariot and horsemen to the sea of sedge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And they will cry to Jehovah, and he will put darkness between you and between Egypt, and he will bring the sea upon him, and will cover him; and your eyes will see what I did in Egypt; and ye shall dwell in the desert many days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And I will bring you to the land of the Amorite dwelling beyond Jordan, and they will fight with you and I will give them into your hand, and ye shall inherit their land; and I will destroy them from before your face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, will rise up and will fight against Israel, and he will send and call for Balaam son of Beor, to curse you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I was not disposed to hear to Balaam and blessing, he will bless you; and I will deliver you from his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And ye shall pass through Jordan, and ye shall come to Jericho; and the lords of Jericho will fight against you, the Amorite and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I will give them into your hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And I will send before you the hornet, and it shall drive them out from your face, the two kings of the Amorites: not with thy sword and not with thy bow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And I will give to you the land which ye labored not in it, and cities which ye built not, and ye shall dwell in them; the vineyards and the olives which ye planted not, ye ate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And, now fear ye Jehovah and serve him in uprightness and in truth; and remove the gods which your fathers served beyond the river and in Egypt; and serve ye Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And if evil in your eyes to serve Jehovah, choose for yourselves this day whom ye will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served which are beyond the river, and whether the gods of the Amorite which ye dwelt in their land: and I and my house, we will serve Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">An the people will answer and say, Woe to us forsaking Jehovah to serve other gods;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For Jehovah our God, he bringing us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants, and who did before our eyes these great signs; and he will watch us in all the way which we went in it, and among all the peoples which we passed through in the midst of them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Jehovah will drive out all the peoples, and the Amorite dwelling in the land, from our face: also we will serve Jehovah, for he is our God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Joshua will say to the people, Ye will not be able to serve Jehovah, for a holy God is he: a jealous God is he; he will not take away your transgressions and your sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">If ye shall forsake Jehovah and serve strange gods, and he turned back and did evil to you, and finished you after that he did good to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the people will say to Joshua, Nay; but Jehovah we will serve.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Joshua will say to the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves, for ye chose to yourselves Jehovah to serve him. And they will say, Witnesses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And now remove the strange gods which are in the midst of you, and incline your heart to Jehovah the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And the people will say to Joshua, Jehovah our God we will serve, and to his voice will we hear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Joshua will cut out a covenant to the people in that day and will set to him a law and a judgment in Shechem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And Joshua will write these words in the book of the law of God, and he will take a great stone and will set it up there under the oak which is in the holy place of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And Joshua will say to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be to us for a testimony, for it heard all the sayings of Jehovah which he spake with us: and it was to you for a testimony lest ye shall lie to your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And Joshua will send away the people each to his inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And it will be after these words, and Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Jehovah, will die, the son of a hundred and ten years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And they will bury him in the bound of his inheritance in Timnath-Serah, which is in mount Ephraim from the north, to the mount of Gaash.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And Israel will serve Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the old men who prolonged the days after Joshua, and who knew all the works of Jehovah which he did to Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And the bones of Joseph which the sons of Israel brought up out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in a portion of the field which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem, for a hundred weight; and they will be to the sons of Joseph for an inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they will bury him in Gibeah of Phinehas his son, which he gave to him in mount Ephraim.</p>
