  <verse number="1">And Jehovah visited Sarah as he had said, and Jehovah did to Sarah as he had spoken.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, being eight days old, as God had commanded him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Sarah said, God has made me laugh: all that hear will laugh with me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And she said, Who would have said to Abraham, Sarah will suckle children? For I have borne [him] a son in his old age.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the child grew, and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And she said to Abraham, Cast out this handmaid and her son; for the son of this handmaid shall not inherit with my son—with Isaac.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his son.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And God said to Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy handmaid: [in] all that Sarah hath said to thee hearken to her voice, for in Isaac shall a seed be called to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But also the son of the handmaid will I make a nation, because he is thy seed.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and a flask of water, and gave [it] to Hagar, putting [it] on her shoulder—and the child, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered about in the wilderness of Beer-sheba.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the water was exhausted from the flask; and she cast the child under one of the shrubs,</verse>
  <verse number="16">and she went and sat down over against [him], a bow-shot off; for she said, Let me not behold the death of the child. And she sat over against [him], and lifted up her voice and wept.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And God heard the voice of the lad. And the Angel of God called to Hagar from the heavens, and said to her, What [aileth] thee, Hagar? Fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad there, where he is.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Arise, take the lad, and hold him in thy hand; for I will make of him a great nation.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the flask with water, and gave the lad drink.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And God was with the lad, and he grew; and he dwelt in the wilderness, and became an archer.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran. And his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech, and Phichol the captain of his host, spoke to Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And now swear to me here by God that thou wilt not deal deceitfully with me, nor with my son, nor with my grandson. According to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land in which thou sojournest.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Abraham said, I will swear.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water that Abimelech’s servants had violently taken away.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And Abimelech said, I do not know who has done this, neither hast thou told me [of it], neither have I heard [of it] but to-day.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Abraham set seven ewe-lambs of the flock by themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Abimelech said to Abraham, What [mean] these seven ewe-lambs, these which thou hast set by themselves?</verse>
  <verse number="30">And he said, That thou take the seven ewe-lambs of my hand, that they may be a witness to me that I have dug this well.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Therefore he called that place Beer-sheba, because there they had sworn, both of them.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And they made a covenant at Beer-sheba. And Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the captain of his host, and returned into the land of the Philistines.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And [Abraham] planted a tamarisk in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of Jehovah, the Eternal God.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines’ land many days.</verse>
