<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, Even by reason of mine agitation that is in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I have heard the reproof which putteth me to shame, But out of my understanding my spirit answereth me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Knowest thou not this of old time, Since man was placed upon earth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless but for a moment?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, And his head reach unto the clouds;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung; They that have seen him shall say: ‘Where is he?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found; Yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The eye which saw him shall see him no more; Neither shall his place any more behold him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">His children shall appease the poor, And his hands shall restore his wealth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">His bones are full of his youth, But it shall lie down with him in the dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, Though he hide it under his tongue;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Though he spare it, and will not let it go, But keep it still within his mouth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Yet his food in his bowels is turned, It is the gall of asps within him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again; God shall cast them out of his belly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He shall suck the poison of asps; The viper’s tongue shall slay him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He shall not look upon the rivers, The flowing streams of honey and curd.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">That which he laboured for shall he give back, and shall not swallow it down; According to the substance that he hath gotten, he shall not rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For he hath oppressed and forsaken the poor; He hath violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Because he knew no quietness within him, In his greed he suffered nought to escape,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">There was nothing left that he devoured not—Therefore his prosperity shall not endure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits; The hand of every one that is in misery shall come upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">It shall be for the filling of his belly; He shall cast the fierceness of His wrath upon him, And shall cause it to rain upon him into his flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">If he flee from the iron weapon, The bow of brass shall strike him through.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He draweth it forth, and it cometh out of his body; Yea, the glittering point cometh out of his gall; Terrors are upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">All darkness is laid up for his treasures; A fire not blown by man shall consume him; It shall go ill with him that is left in his tent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The heavens shall reveal his iniquity, And the earth shall rise up against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The increase of his house shall depart, His goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">This is the portion of a wicked man from God, And the heritage appointed unto him by God.</p>
