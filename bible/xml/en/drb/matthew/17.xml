  <verse number="1">AND after six days Jesus taketh unto him Peter and James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart:</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he was transfigured before them. And his face did shine as the sun: and his garments became white as snow.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And behold there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Peter answering, said to Jesus: Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And as he was yet speaking, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them. And lo, a voice out of the cloud, saying: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: hear ye him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the disciples hearing, fell upon their face, and were very much afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Jesus came and touched them: and said to them, Arise, and fear not.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And they lifting up their eyes saw no one but only Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying: Tell the vision to no man, till the Son of man be risen from the dead.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And his disciples asked him, saying: Why then do the scribes say that Elias must come first?</verse>
  <verse number="11">But he answering, said to them: Elias indeed shall come, and restore all things.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But I say to you, that Elias is already come, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they had a mind. So also the Son of man shall suffer from them.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then the disciples understood, that he had spoken to them of John the Baptist.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And when he was come to the multitude, there came to him a man falling down on his knees before him, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="15">Lord, have pity on my son, for he is a lunatic, and suffereth much: for he falleth often into the fire, and often into the water.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Then Jesus answered and said: O unbelieving and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? bring him hither to me.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Jesus rebuked him, and the devil went out of him, and the child was cured from that hour.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Then came the disciples to Jesus secretly, and said: Why could not we cast him out?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Jesus said to them: Because of your unbelief. For, amen I say to you, if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove from hence hither, and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But this kind is not cast out but by prayer and fasting.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And when they abode together in Galilee, Jesus said to them: The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise again. And they were troubled exceedingly.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And when they were come to Capharnaum, they that recieved the didrachmas, came to Peter and said to him: Doth not your master pay the didrachmas?</verse>
  <verse number="25">He said: Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus prevented him, saying: What is thy opinion, Simon? The kings of the earth, of whom do they receive tribute or custom? of their own children, or of strangers?</verse>
  <verse number="26">And he said: Of strangers. Jesus said to him: Then the children are free.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But that we may not scandalize them, go to the sea, and cast in a hook: and that fish which shall first come up, take: and when thou hast opened its mouth, thou shalt find a stater: take that, and give it to them for me and thee.</verse>
