  <verse number="1">And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, which they hallow unto me, and that they profane not my holy name: I am Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed throughout your generations, that approacheth unto the holy things, which the children of Israel hallow unto Jehovah, having his uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from before me: I am Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="4">What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath an issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he be clean. And whoso toucheth anything that is unclean by the dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;</verse>
  <verse number="5">or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness, whatsoever uncleanness he hath;</verse>
  <verse number="6">the soul that toucheth any such shall be unclean until the even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his flesh in water.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And when the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he shall eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.</verse>
  <verse number="8">That which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts, he shall not eat, to defile himself therewith:—I am Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="9">They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it: I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them.</verse>
  <verse number="10">There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of the priest’s, or a hired servant, shall not eat of the holy thing.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But if a priest buy any soul, the purchase of his money, he shall eat of it; and such as are born in his house, they shall eat of his bread.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And if a priest’s daughter be married unto a stranger, she shall not eat of the heave-offering of the holy things.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But if a priest’s daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have no child, and be returned unto her father’s house, as in her youth, she shall eat of her father’s bread: but there shall no stranger eat thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give unto the priest the holy thing.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, which they offer unto Jehovah,</verse>
  <verse number="16">and so cause them to bear the iniquity that bringeth guilt, when they eat their holy things: for I am Jehovah who sanctifieth them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="18">Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whosoever he be of the house of Israel, or of the sojourners in Israel, that offereth his oblation, whether it be any of their vows, or any of their freewill-offerings, which they offer unto Jehovah for a burnt-offering;</verse>
  <verse number="19">that ye may be accepted, ye shall offer a male without blemish, of the bullocks, of the sheep, or of the goats.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace-offerings unto Jehovah to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill-offering, of the herd or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto Jehovah, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Either a bullock or a lamb that hath anything superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill-offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.</verse>
  <verse number="24">That which hath its stones bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut, ye shall not offer unto Jehovah; neither shall ye do thus in your land.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them, there is a blemish in them: they shall not be accepted for you.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="27">When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for the oblation of an offering made by fire unto Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And whether it be cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and its young both in one day.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And when ye sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto Jehovah, ye shall sacrifice it that ye may be accepted.</verse>
  <verse number="30">On the same day it shall be eaten; ye shall leave none of it until the morning: I am Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And ye shall not profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I am Jehovah who halloweth you,</verse>
  <verse number="33">who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am Jehovah.</verse>
