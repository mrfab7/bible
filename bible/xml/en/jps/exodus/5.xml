  <verse number="1">And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said unto Pharaoh: ‘Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Let My people go, that they may hold a feast unto Me in the wilderness.’</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Pharaoh said: ‘Who is the LORD, that I should hearken unto His voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, and moreover I will not let Israel go.’</verse>
  <verse number="3">And they said: ‘The God of the Hebrews hath met with us. Let us go, we pray thee, three days’ journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice unto the LORD our God; lest He fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.’</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the king of Egypt said unto them: ‘Wherefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, cause the people to break loose from their work? get you unto your burdens.’</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Pharaoh said: ‘Behold, the people of the land are now many, and will ye make them rest from their burdens?’</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="7">Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the tale of the bricks, which they did make heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof; for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying: Let us go and sacrifice to our God.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Let heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labour therein; and let them not regard lying words.’</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying: ‘Thus saith Pharaoh: I will not give you straw.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it; for nought of your work shall be diminished.’</verse>
  <verse number="12">So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the taskmasters were urgent, saying: ‘Fulfil your work, your daily task, as when there was straw.’</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, saying: ‘Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your appointed task in making brick both yesterday and today as heretofore?’</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying: ‘Wherefore dealest thou thus with thy servants?</verse>
  <verse number="16">There is no straw given unto thy servants, and they say to us: Make brick; and, behold, thy servants are beaten, but the fault is in thine own people.’</verse>
  <verse number="17">But he said: ‘Ye are idle, ye are idle; therefore ye say: Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the tale of bricks.’</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the officers of the children of Israel did see that they were set on mischief, when they said: ‘Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks, your daily task.’</verse>
  <verse number="20">And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh;</verse>
  <verse number="21">and they said unto them: ‘The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.’</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Moses returned unto the LORD, and said: ‘Lord, wherefore hast Thou dealt ill with this people? why is it that Thou hast sent me?</verse>
  <verse number="23">For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Thy name, he hath dealt ill with this people; neither hast Thou delivered Thy people at all.’</verse>
