<div class="chapter" data-book="Romans" data-chapter="13" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Whoever therefore resists the power, resists the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Will you then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and you shall have praise of the same:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For he is the minister of God to you for good. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid; for he bears not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath on him that does evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Why you must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For for this cause pay you tribute also: for they are Godâ€™s ministers, attending continually on this very thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loves another has fulfilled the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Love works no ill to his neighbor: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But put you on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.</p>
