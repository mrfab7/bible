<chapter book="Isaiah" number="46" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Bel bows down, Nebo stoops; their idols are on the animals, and on the livestock: the things that you carried about are made a load, a burden to the weary.</verse>
  <verse number="2">They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves have gone into captivity.</verse>
  <verse number="3">“Listen to me, house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, that have been borne from their birth, that have been carried from the womb;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and even to old age I am he, and even to gray hairs will I carry you. I have made, and I will bear; yes, I will carry, and will deliver.</verse>
  <verse number="5">“To whom will you liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Some pour out gold from the bag, and weigh silver in the balance. They hire a goldsmith, and he makes it a god. They fall down—yes, they worship.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They bear it on the shoulder, they carry it, and set it in its place, and it stands, from its place it shall not move: yes, one may cry to it, yet it can not answer, nor save him out of his trouble.</verse>
  <verse number="8">“Remember this, and show yourselves men; bring it again to mind, you transgressors.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like me;</verse>
  <verse number="10">declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times things that are not yet done; saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure;</verse>
  <verse number="11">calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man of my counsel from a far country; yes, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed, I will also do it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Listen to me, you stout-hearted, who are far from righteousness:</verse>
  <verse number="13">I bring near my righteousness, it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not wait; and I will place salvation in Zion for Israel my glory.</verse>
