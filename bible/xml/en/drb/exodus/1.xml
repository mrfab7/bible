  <verse number="1">These are the names of the children of Israel, that went into Egypt with Jacob: they went in, every man with his household:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Ruben, Simeon, Levi, Juda,</verse>
  <verse number="3">Issachar, Zabulon, and Benjamin,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Dan, and Nephtali, Gad and Aser.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And all the souls that came out of Jacob’s thigh, were seventy: but Joseph was in Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="6">After he was dead, and all his brethren, and all that generation,</verse>
  <verse number="7">The children of Israel increased, and sprung up into multitudes, and growing exceedingly strong they filled the land.</verse>
  <verse number="8">In the mean time there arose a new king over Egypt, that knew not Joseph:</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he said to his people: Behold the people of the children of Israel are numerous and stronger than we.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Come, let us wisely oppress them, lest they multiply: and if any war shall rise against us, join with our enemies, and having overcome us, depart out of the land.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Therefore he set over them masters of the works, to afflict them with burdens, and they built for Pharao cities of tabernacles, Phithom and Ramesses.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But the more they oppressed them, the more they were multiplied, and increased:</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the Egyptians hated the children of Israel, and afflicted them and mocked them:</verse>
  <verse number="14">And they made their life bitter with hard works in clay, and brick, and with all manner of service, wherewith they were overcharged in the works of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the king of Egypt spoke to the midwives of the Hebrews: of whom one was called Sephora, the other Phua,</verse>
  <verse number="16">Commanding them: When you shall do the office of midwives to the Hebrew women, and the time of delivery is come: if it be a man child, kill it: if a woman, keep it alive.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt had commanded, but saved the men children.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the king called for them and said: What is that you meant to do, that you would save the men children ?</verse>
  <verse number="19">They answered: The Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women: for they themselves are skillful in the office of a midwife; and they are delivered before we come to them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied and grew exceedingly strong.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And because the midwives feared God, he built them houses.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Pharao therefore charged all his people, saying: Whatsoever shall be born of the male sex, ye shall cast into the river: whatsoever of the female, ye shall save alive.</verse>
