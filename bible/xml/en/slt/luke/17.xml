  <verse number="1">And he said to the disciples, It is impossible there come not causes of offence: and woe, through whom they come!</verse>
  <verse number="2">It is profitable to him if the millstone of an ass were placed about his neck, and he cast into the sea, rather than he should offend one of these little ones.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Attend to yourselves: and if thy brother sin against thee, censure him; and if he should repent, let him go.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And if seven times in a day he sin against thee, and seven times in a day turn back to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt let him go.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the sent said to the Lord, Add faith to us.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a kernel of mustard, said ye to this mulberry-tree, Be thou rooted up, and planted in the sea; and it had listened to you.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And which of you having a servant ploughing or feeding, who will say to him having come out of the field, Quickly having come, recline?</verse>
  <verse number="8">But will he not say to him, Prepare what I shall sup, and, being girded, serve me, till I eat and drink; and after these, thou mayest eat and drink?</verse>
  <verse number="9">He has no favor to that servant, for he did the things appointed. I think not.</verse>
  <verse number="10">So also ye, when ye do all appointed you, say, That we are useless servants: for what we ought to do, we have done.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it was in his going to Jerusalem, and he came through the land of Samaria and Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he coming to a certain town, ten leprous men met him, who stood far off:</verse>
  <verse number="13">And they lifted up the voice, saying, Jesus, faster, pity us.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And having seen, he said to them, Having gone, show yourselves to the priests. And it was in their retiring they were cleansed.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And one of them, having seen that he was healed, turned back, with a great voice honouring God.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he fell upon the face at his feet, thanking him: and he was a Samaritan.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Jesus having answered said, Were not ten cleansed? and where the nine?</verse>
  <verse number="18">They were not found returning to give glory to God, except this of another race.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And he said to him, Having risen, go: thy faith has saved thee.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And having been asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God comes, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God comes not with observation:</verse>
  <verse number="21">Neither shall they say, Behold here or, behold there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he said to the disciples, The days come when ye shall eagerly desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they shall say to you, Behold here, or; behold there: go not away, nor pursue.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For as lightning, flashing out from that under heaven, shines to that under heaven; so also shall be the Son of man in his day.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And first must he suffer many things, and be disapproved of by this generation.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be in the days of the Son of man.</verse>
  <verse number="27">They ate, they drank, they married, they were given in marriage, till the day which Noe came into the ark, and the overflow came, and destroyed all.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And likewise as it was in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;</verse>
  <verse number="29">And the day which Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and sulphur from heaven, and destroyed all.</verse>
  <verse number="30">According to these shall be the day in which the Son of man is revealed.</verse>
  <verse number="31">In that day, whoever shall be upon the house, and his goods in the house, let him not go down to take them away: and he in the fields, likewise let him not turn back behind.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Remember Lot’s wife.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Whoever should seek to save his life shall lose it; and whoever shall lose it, shall preserve it alive.</verse>
  <verse number="34">I say to you, that night shall be two upon one bed; one shall be taken, and the other let go.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Two females shall be grinding together; one shall be taken, and the other let go.</verse>
  <verse number="36">[Verse 36 is wanting (Missing) in most of the Greek copies.]</verse>
  <verse number="37">And having answered, they say to him, Where, Lord And he said to them, Where the body, there shall the eagles be gathered together.</verse>
