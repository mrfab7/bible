<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Who shall give thee to me for my brother, sucking the breasts of my mother, that I may find thee without, and kiss thee, and now no man may despise me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I will take hold of thee, and bring thee Into my motherâ€™s house: there thou shalt teach me, and I will give thee a cup of spiced wine and new wine of my pomegranates.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">His left hand under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you stir not up, nor awake my love till she please.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who is this that cometh up from the desert, flowing with delights, leaning upon her beloved? Under the apple tree I raised thee up: there thy mother was corrupted, there she was defloured that bore thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Put me as a seal upon thy heart, as a seal upon thy arm, for love is strong as death, jealousy as hard as hell, the lamps thereof are fire and flames.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Many waters cannot quench charity, neither can the floods drown it: if a man should give all the substance of his house for love, he shall despise it as nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Our sister is little, and hath no breasts. What shall we do to our sister in the day when she is to be spoken to?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">If she be a wall: let us build upon it bulwarks of silver: if she be a door, let us join it together with boards or cedar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I am a wall: and my breasts are as a tower since I am become in his presence as one finding peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The peaceable had a vineyard, in that which hath people: he let out the same to keepers, every man bringeth for the fruit thereof a thousand pieces of silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">My vineyard is before me. A thousand are for thee, the peaceable, and two hundred for them that keep the fruit thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the friends hearken: make me hear thy voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Flee away, O my beloved, and be like to the roe, and to the young hart upon the mountains of aromatical spices.</p>
