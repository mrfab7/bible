<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Remember, O Jehovah, what is come upon us; consider, and see our reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Our water have we to drink for money, our wood cometh unto us for a price.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Our pursuers are on our necks: we are weary, we have no rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">We have given the hand to Egypt, [and] to Asshur, to be satisfied with bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Our fathers have sinned, [and] they are not; and we bear their iniquities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Bondmen rule over us: there is no deliverer out of their hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">We have to get our bread at the risk of our lives, because of the sword of the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Our skin gloweth like an oven, because of the burning heat of the famine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They have ravished the women in Zion, the maids in the cities of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Princes were hanged up by their hand; the faces of elders were not honoured.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The young men have borne the mill, and the youths have stumbled under the wood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The joy of our heart hath ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, for we have sinned!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes have grown dim,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate: foxes walk over it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thou, Jehovah, dwellest for ever; thy throne is from generation to generation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, dost thou forsake us so long time?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Turn thou us unto thee, Jehovah, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Or is it that thou hast utterly rejected us? Wouldest thou be exceeding wroth against us?</p>
