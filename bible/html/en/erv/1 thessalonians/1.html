<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labour of love and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, before our God and Father;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">how that our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; even as ye know what manner of men we shewed ourselves toward you for your sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And ye became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">so that ye became an ensample to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For from you hath sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith to God-ward is gone forth; so that we need not to speak anything.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For they themselves report concerning us what manner of entering in we had unto you; and how ye turned unto God from idols, to serve a living and true God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivereth us from the wrath to come.</p>
