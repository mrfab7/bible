  <verse number="1">After this hath Job opened his mouth, and revileth his day.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Job answereth and saith:—</verse>
  <verse number="3">Let the day perish in which I am born, And the night that hath said: ‘A man-child hath been conceived.’</verse>
  <verse number="4">That day—let it be darkness, Let not God require it from above, Nor let light shine upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Let darkness and death-shade redeem it, Let a cloud tabernacle upon it, Let them terrify it as the most bitter of days.</verse>
  <verse number="6">That night—let thick darkness take it, Let it not be united to days of the year, Into the number of months let it not come.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Lo! that night—let it be gloomy, Let no singing come into it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Let the cursers of day mark it, Who are ready to wake up Leviathan.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Let the stars of its twilight be dark, Let it wait for light, and there is none, And let it not look on the eyelids of the dawn.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Because it hath not shut the doors Of the womb that was mine! And hide misery from mine eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Why from the womb do I not die? From the belly I have come forth and gasp!</verse>
  <verse number="12">Wherefore have knees been before me? And what are breasts, that I suck?</verse>
  <verse number="13">For now, I have lain down, and am quiet, I have slept—then there is rest to me,</verse>
  <verse number="14">With kings and counsellors of earth, These building wastes for themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Or with princes—they have gold, They are filling their houses with silver.</verse>
  <verse number="16">(Or as a hidden abortion I am not, As infants—they have not seen light.)</verse>
  <verse number="17">There the wicked have ceased troubling, And there rest do the wearied in power.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Together prisoners have been at ease, They have not heard the voice of an exactor,</verse>
  <verse number="19">Small and great are there the same. And a servant is free from his lord.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Why giveth He to the miserable light, and life to the bitter soul?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Who are waiting for death, and it is not, And they seek it above hid treasures.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Who are glad—unto joy, They rejoice when they find a grave.</verse>
  <verse number="23">To a man whose way hath been hidden, And whom God doth shut up?</verse>
  <verse number="24">For before my food, my sighing cometh, And poured out as waters are my roarings.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For a fear I feared and it meeteth me, And what I was afraid of doth come to me.</verse>
  <verse number="26">I was not safe—nor was I quiet—Nor was I at rest—and trouble cometh!</verse>
