<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The sons of Amram: Aaron, Moses, and Miriam. The sons of Aaron: Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Eleazar conceived Phinehas, and Phinehas conceived Abishua.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Now Jehozadak departed, when the Lord took away Judah and Jerusalem, by the hands of Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">So the sons of Levi were Gershom, Kohath, and Merari.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And these are the names of the sons of Gershom: Libni and Shimei.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="31">These are the ones whom David appointed over the singing men in the house of the Lord, in the place where the ark was located.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And they ministered before the tabernacle of the testimony with singing, until Solomon built the house of the Lord in Jerusalem. And they would stand according to their order in the ministry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Truly, these are the ones who were assisting, with their sons, from the sons of Kohath: the singer Heman, the son of Joel, the son of Samuel,</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="43">the son of Jahath, the son of Gershom, the son of Levi.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">Now the sons of Merari, their brothers, were on the left: Ethan, the son of Kishi, the son of Abdi, the son of Malluch,</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="48">There were also their brothers, Levites who were appointed for every ministry of the tabernacle of the house of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">Truly, Aaron and his sons were burning offerings upon the altar of holocausts and upon the altar of incense, for the entire work of the Holy of Holies, and to pray on behalf of Israel, in accord with all the things that Moses, the servant of God, had instructed.</p>
