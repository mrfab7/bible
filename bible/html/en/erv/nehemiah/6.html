<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though even unto that time I had not set up the doors in the gates;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: Why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">wherein was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou buildest the wall: and thou wouldest be their king, according to these words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. But now, O God, strengthen thou my hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him: but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard thereof, that all the heathen that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Also they spake of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</p>
