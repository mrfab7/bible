<p class="verse" data-verse="1">What advantage then hath the Jew? or what is the profit of circumcision?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Much every way: first of all, that they were intrusted with the oracles of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For what if some were without faith? shall their want of faith make of none effect the faithfulness of God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">God forbid: yea, let God be found true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy words, And mightest prevail when thou comest into judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But if our unrighteousness commendeth the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who visiteth with wrath? (I speak after the manner of men.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But if the truth of God through my lie abounded unto his glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">and why not (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? whose condemnation is just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we before laid to the charge both of Jews and Greeks, that they are all under sin;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">as it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">There is none that understandeth, There is none that seeketh after God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They have all turned aside, they are together become unprofitable; There is none that doeth good, no, not so much as one:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Their throat is an open sepulchre; With their tongues they have used deceit: The poison of asps is under their lips:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Their feet are swift to shed blood;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Destruction and misery are in their ways;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the way of peace have they not known:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">There is no fear of God before their eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it speaketh to them that are under the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be brought under the judgment of God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified in his sight; for through the law cometh the knowledge of sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But now apart from the law a righteousness of God hath been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">even the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ unto all them that believe; for there is no distinction;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">for all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">whom God set forth to be a propitiation, through faith, in his blood, to show his righteousness because of the passing over of the sins done aforetime, in the forbearance of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">for the showing, I say, of his righteousness at this present season: that he might himself be just, and the justifier of him that hath faith in Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Where then is the glorying? It is excluded. By what manner of law? of works? Nay: but by a law of faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">We reckon therefore that a man is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Or is God the God of Jews only? is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yea, of Gentiles also:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">if so be that God is one, and he shall justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Do we then make the law of none effect through faith? God forbid: nay, we establish the law.</p>
