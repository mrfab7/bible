  <verse number="1">The burden of which Babylon, Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Set ye up an ensign upon the bare mountain, lift up the voice unto them, wave the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I have commanded my consecrated ones, yea, I have called my mighty men for mine anger, even my proudly exulting ones.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people! the noise of a tumult of the kingdoms of the nations gathered together! the LORD of hosts mustereth the host for the battle.</verse>
  <verse number="5">They come from a far country, from the uttermost part of heaven, even the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; as destruction from the Almighty shall it come.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore shall all hands be feeble, and every heart of man shall melt:</verse>
  <verse number="8">and they shall be dismayed; pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman in travail: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be faces of flame.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel, with wrath and fierce anger; to make the land a desolation, and to destroy the sinners thereof out of it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I will make a man more rare than fine gold, even a man than the pure gold of Ophir.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Therefore I will make the heavens to tremble, and the earth shall be shaken out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And it shall come to pass, that as the chased roe, and as sheep that no man gathereth, they shall turn every man to his own people, and shall flee every man to his own land.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is taken shall fall by the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Their infants also shall be dashed in pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver, and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And their bows shall dash the young men in pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldeans’ pride, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.</verse>
  <verse number="20">It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall shepherds make their flocks to lie down there.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and ostriches shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And wolves shall cry in their castles, and jackals in the pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.</verse>
