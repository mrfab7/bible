<p class="verse" data-verse="1">AND on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And they found the stone rolled back from the sepulchre.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And going in, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And it came to pass, as they were astonished in their mind at this, behold, two men stood by them, in shining apparel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And as they were afraid, and bowed down their countenance towards the ground, they said unto them: Why seek you the living with the dead?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He is not here, but is risen. Remember how he spoke unto you, when he was in Galilee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Saying: The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And they remembered his words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And going back from the sepulchre, they told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And it was Mary Magdalen, and Joanna, and Mary of James, and the other women that were with them, who told these things to the apostles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And these words seemed to them as idle tales; and they did not believe them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But Peter rising up, ran to the sepulchre, and stooping down, he saw the linen cloths laid by themselves; and went away wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And behold, two of them went, the same day, to a town which was sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, named Emmaus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And it came to pass, that while they talked and reasoned with themselves, Jesus himself also drawing near, went with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But their eyes were held, that they should not know him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he said to them: What are these discourses that you hold one with another as you walk, and are sad?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the one of them, whose name was Cleophas, answering, said to him: Art thou only a stranger to Jerusalem, and hast not known the things that have been done there in these days?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">To whom he said: What things? And they said: Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, mighty in work and word before God and all the people;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And how our chief priests and princes delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But we hoped, that it was he that should have redeemed Israel: and now besides all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Yea and certain women also of our company affrighted us, who before it was light, were at the sepulchre,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And not finding his body, came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who say that he is alive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And some of our people went to the sepulchre, and found it so as the women had said, but him they found not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Then he said to them: O foolish, and slow of heart to believe in all things which the prophets have spoken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and so to enter into his glory?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures, the things that were concerning him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And they drew night to the town, whither they were going: and he made as though he would go farther.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">But they constrained him; saying: Stay with us, because it is towards evening, and the day is now far spent. And he went in with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And it came to pass, whilst he was at table with them, he took bread, and blessed, and brake, and gave to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And their eyes were opened, and they knew him: and he vanished out of their sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And they said one to the other: Was not our heart burning within us, whilst he spoke in this way, and opened to us the scriptures?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And rising up, the same hour, they went back to Jerusalem: and they found the eleven gathered together, and those that were staying with them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Saying: The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And they told what things were done in the way; and how they knew him in the breaking of the bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Now whilst they were speaking these things, Jesus stood in the midst of them, and saith to them: Peace be to you; it is I, fear not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">But they being troubled and frightened, supposed that they saw a spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And he said to them: Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">See my hands and feet, that it is I myself; handle, and see: for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see me to have.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And when he had said this, he shewed them his hands and feet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">But while they yet believed not, and wondered for joy, he said: Have you any thing to eat?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And they offered him a piece of a broiled fish, and a honeycomb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And when he had eaten before them, taking the remains, he gave to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And he said to them: These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">And he said to them: Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise again from the dead, the third day:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">And that penance and remission of sins should be preached in his name, unto all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">And you are witnesses of these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">And I send the promise of my Father upon you: but stay you in the city till you be endued with power from on high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">And he led them out as far as Bethania: and lifting up his hands, he blessed them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">And it came to pass, whilst he blessed them, he departed from them, and was carried up to heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">And they adoring went back into Jerusalem with great joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">And they were always in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</p>
