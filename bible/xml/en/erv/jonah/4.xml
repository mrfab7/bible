<chapter book="Jonah" number="4" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I hasted to flee unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and full of compassion, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy, and repentest thee of the evil.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the LORD said, Doest thou well to be angry?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his evil case. So Jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a sultry east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry even unto death.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the LORD said, Thou hast had pity on the gourd; for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:</verse>
  <verse number="11">and should not I have pity on Nineveh, that great city; wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?</verse>
