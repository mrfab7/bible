  <verse number="2">“Speak to the Israelites and tell them: I am the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">You must not follow the practices of the land of Egypt, where you used to live, and you must not follow the practices of the land of Canaan, into which I am bringing you. You must not walk in their customs.</verse>
  <verse number="4">You are to practice My judgments and keep My statutes by walking in them. I am the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Keep My statutes and My judgments, for the man who does these things will live by them. I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="6">None of you are to approach any close relative to have sexual relations. I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="7">You must not expose the nakedness of your father by having sexual relations with your mother. She is your mother; you must not have sexual relations with her.</verse>
  <verse number="8">You must not have sexual relations with your father’s wife; it would dishonor your father.</verse>
  <verse number="9">You must not have sexual relations with your sister, either your father’s daughter or your mother’s daughter, whether she was born in the same home or elsewhere.</verse>
  <verse number="10">You must not have sexual relations with your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter, for that would shame your family.</verse>
  <verse number="11">You must not have sexual relations with the daughter of your father’s wife, born to your father; she is your sister.</verse>
  <verse number="12">You must not have sexual relations with your father’s sister; she is your father’s close relative.</verse>
  <verse number="13">You must not have sexual relations with your mother’s sister, for she is your mother’s close relative.</verse>
  <verse number="14">You must not dishonor your father’s brother by approaching his wife to have sexual relations with her; she is your aunt.</verse>

  <verse number="16">You must not have sexual relations with your brother’s wife; that would shame your brother.</verse>
  <verse number="17">You must not have sexual relations with both a woman and her daughter. You are not to marry her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter and have sexual relations with her. They are close relatives; it is depraved.</verse>
  <verse number="18">You must not take your wife’s sister as a rival wife and have sexual relations with her while your wife is still alive.</verse>
  <verse number="19">You must not approach a woman to have sexual relations with her during her menstrual period.</verse>

  <verse number="22">You must not lie with a man as with a woman; that is an abomination.</verse>
  <verse number="23">You must not lie carnally with any animal, thus defiling yourself with it; a woman must not stand before an animal to mate with it; that is a perversion.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Do not defile yourselves by any of these practices, for by all these things the nations I am driving out before you have defiled themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Even the land has become defiled, so I am punishing it for its sin, and the land will vomit out its inhabitants.</verse>
  <verse number="26">But you are to keep My statutes and ordinances, and you must not commit any of these abominations—neither your native-born nor the foreigner who lives among you.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For the men who were in the land before you committed all these abominations, and the land has become defiled.</verse>
  <verse number="28">So if you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it spewed out the nations before you.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Therefore anyone who commits any of these abominations must be cut off from among his people.</verse>
  <verse number="30">You must keep My charge not to practice any of the abominable customs that were practiced before you, so that you do not defile yourselves by them. I am the LORD your God.”</verse>
