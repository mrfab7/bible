  <verse number="1">Manasseh the son of twelve years in his reigning, and fifty and five years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name Hephzibah.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah, according to the abominations of the nations which Jehovah dispossessed from the face of the sons of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he will turn back and build the heights which Hezekiah his father destroyed; and he will raise up altars to Baal, and make a statue as did Ahab king of Israel; and he will worship to all the army of the heavens, and serve them.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he built altars in the house of Jehovah where Jehovah said, In Jerusalem I will put my name.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he will build altars to all the army of the heavens in the two enclosures of the house of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he caused his sons to pass through in fire, and he practiced magic, and took auguries, and made necromancy and a wizard spirit: he multiplied to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah to irritate.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he will set up a carved thing of the image which he made in the house, of which Jehovah said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house and in Jerusalem which I chose from all the tribes of Israel, I will set my name forever:</verse>
  <verse number="8">And I will not add to move the foot of Israel from the land which I gave to their fathers; only if they will watch to do according to all I commanded them, and for all the instructions which Moses my servant commanded them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But they heard not, and Manasseh will cause them to go astray to do evil more than the nations which Jehovah destroyed from the face of the sons of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Jehovah will speak by the hand of his servants the prophets, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="11">Because Manasseh king of Judah did these abominations, doing evil above all which the Amorites did that were before him, and he will also cause Judah to sin with his blocks:</verse>
  <verse number="12">For this, thus said Jehovah the God of Israel, Behold me bringing evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, which all hearing it, his two ears shall tingle.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And I stretched over Jerusalem the cord of Shomeron, and the weight of the house of Ahab: and I wiped off Jerusalem as one will wipe dishes, wiping, and turning upon its face.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And I thrust out the remainder of my inheritance, and I gave them into the hand of their enemies; and they were for plunder and for a prey to all their enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Because they did evil in mine eyes, and they will be irritating me from the day which their fathers came forth out of Egypt, and even to this day.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And also Manasseh poured out innocent blood exceeding much, till he filled Jerusalem mouth to mouth; besides his sins which he caused Judah to sin to do evil in the eyes of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the rest of the words of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sins which he sinned, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Judah?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Manasseh will lie down with his fathers, and will be buried in the garden of his house, in the garden of Uzzah: and Amon his son will reign in his stead.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The son of twenty and two years was Amon in his reigning, and two years he reigned in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name Meshullemeth, daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he will do evil in the eyes of Jehovah as did Manasseh his father.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And he will go in all the ways which his father went, and he will serve the blocks which his father served, and he will worship to them.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he will forsake Jehovah the God of his fathers, and he went not in the way of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And the servants of Amon will conspire against him, and they will kill the king in his house.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the people of the land will strike all those conspiring against king Amon; and the people of the land will make Josiah his son king in his stead.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the rest of the words of Amon which he did, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Judah?</verse>
  <verse number="26">And he will be buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzzah; and Josiah his son will reign in his stead.</verse>
