<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="30" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spoke to Ithiel, even to Ithiel and Ucal,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who has ascended up into heaven, or descended? who has gathered the wind in his fists? who has bound the waters in a garment? who has established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son’s name, if you can tell?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Every word of God is pure: he is a shield to them that put their trust in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Add you not to his words, lest he reprove you, and you be found a liar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Two things have I required of you; deny me them not before I die:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Lest I be full, and deny you, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Accuse not a servant to his master, lest he curse you, and you be found guilty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">There is a generation that curses their father, and does not bless their mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The horse leach has two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yes, four things say not, It is enough:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that said not, It is enough.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The eye that mocks at his father, and despises to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yes, four which I know not:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent on a rock; the way of a ship in the middle of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eats, and wipes her mouth, and said, I have done no wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For a servant when he reigns; and a fool when he is filled with meat;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">There be four things which are little on the earth, but they are exceeding wise:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The spider takes hold with her hands, and is in kings’ palaces.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">There be three things which go well, yes, four are comely in going:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turns not away for any;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">If you have done foolishly in lifting up yourself, or if you have thought evil, lay your hand on your mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Surely the churning of milk brings forth butter, and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood: so the forcing of wrath brings forth strife.</p>
