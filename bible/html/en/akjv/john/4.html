<div class="chapter" data-book="John" data-chapter="4" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he must needs go through Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then comes he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Now Jacobâ€™s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">There comes a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus said to her, Give me to drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">(For his disciples were gone away to the city to buy meat.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then said the woman of Samaria to him, How is it that you, being a Jew, ask drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Jesus answered and said to her, If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that said to you, Give me to drink; you would have asked of him, and he would have given you living water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The woman said to him, Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from where then have you that living water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Are you greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Jesus answered and said to her, Whoever drinks of this water shall thirst again:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The woman said to him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come here to draw.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband, and come here.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said to her, You have well said, I have no husband:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have is not your husband: in that said you truly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The woman said to him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and you say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">You worship you know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeks such to worship him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The woman said to him, I know that Messias comes, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Jesus said to her, I that speak to you am he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And on this came his disciples, and marveled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seek you? or, Why talk you with her?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The woman then left her water pot, and went her way into the city, and said to the men,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Then they went out of the city, and came to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">But he said to them, I have meat to eat that you know not of.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Therefore said the disciples one to another, Has any man brought him ought to eat?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Jesus said to them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Say not you, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And he that reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to life eternal: that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And herein is that saying true, One sows, and another reaps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">I sent you to reap that where on you bestowed no labor: other men labored, and you are entered into their labors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">So when the Samaritans were come to him, they sought him that he would tarry with them: and he stayed there two days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And many more believed because of his own word;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of your saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">Now after two days he departed there, and went into Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went to the feast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went to him, and sought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">Then said Jesus to him, Except you see signs and wonders, you will not believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">The nobleman said to him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">Jesus said to him, Go your way; your son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken to him, and he went his way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Your son lives.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">Then inquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said to him, Your son lives: and himself believed, and his whole house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.</p>
