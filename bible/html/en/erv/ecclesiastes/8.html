<div class="chapter" data-book="Ecclesiastes" data-chapter="8" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? A man’s wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the hardness of his face is changed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I counsel thee, Keep the king’s command, and that in regard of the oath of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Be not hasty to go out of his presence; persist not in an evil thing: for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Because the king’s word hath power; and who may say unto him, What doest thou?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Whoso keepeth the commandment shall know no evil thing; and a wise man’s heart discerneth time and judgment:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">for to every purpose there is a time and judgment; because the misery of man is great upon him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">for he knoweth not that which shall be; for who can tell him how it shall be?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power over the day of death; and there is no discharge in that war: neither shall wickedness deliver him that is given to it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man hath power over another to his hurt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And withal I saw the wicked buried, and they came to the grave; and they that had done right went away from the holy place, and were forgotten in the city: this also is vanity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and prolong his days, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">but it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be righteous men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him in his labour all the days of his life which God hath given him under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">then I beheld all the work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because however much a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea moreover, though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.</p>
