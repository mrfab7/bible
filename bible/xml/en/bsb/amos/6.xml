  <verse number="3">You dismiss the day of calamity and bring near a reign of violence.</verse>
  <verse number="4">You lie on beds inlaid with ivory, and lounge upon your couches. You dine on lambs from the flock and calves from the stall.</verse>
  <verse number="5">You improvise songs on the harp like David and invent your own musical instruments.</verse>
  <verse number="6">You drink wine by the bowlful and anoint yourselves with the finest oils, but you fail to grieve over the ruin of Joseph.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore, you will now go into exile as the first of the captives, and your feasting and lounging will come to an end.</verse>

  <verse number="10">And when the relative who is to burn the bodies picks them up to remove them from the house, he will call to one inside, “Is anyone else with you?” “None,” that person will answer. “Silence,” the relative will retort, “for the name of the LORD must not be invoked.”</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the LORD gives a command: “The great house will be smashed to pieces, and the small house to rubble.”</verse>

  <verse number="13">you who rejoice in Lo-debar and say, ‘Did we not take Karnaim by our own strength?’</verse>
  <verse number="14">For behold, I will raise up a nation against you, O house of Israel,” declares the LORD, the God of Hosts, “and they will oppress you from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of the Arabah.”</verse>
