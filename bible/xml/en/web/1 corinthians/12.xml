<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="12" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now concerning spiritual things, brothers, I don’t want you to be ignorant.</verse>
  <verse number="2">You know that when you were heathen, you were led away to those mute idols, however you might be led.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Therefore I make known to you that no man speaking by God’s Spirit says, “Jesus is accursed.” No one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” but by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Now there are various kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="5">There are various kinds of service, and the same Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="6">There are various kinds of workings, but the same God, who works all things in all.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the profit of all.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For to one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, and to another the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="9">to another faith, by the same Spirit; and to another gifts of healings, by the same Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="10">and to another workings of miracles; and to another prophecy; and to another discerning of spirits; to another different kinds of languages; and to another the interpretation of languages.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But the one and the same Spirit works all of these, distributing to each one separately as he desires.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all given to drink into one Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For the body is not one member, but many.</verse>
  <verse number="15">If the foot would say, “Because I’m not the hand, I’m not part of the body,” it is not therefore not part of the body.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If the ear would say, “Because I’m not the eye, I’m not part of the body,” it’s not therefore not part of the body.</verse>
  <verse number="17">If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?</verse>
  <verse number="18">But now God has set the members, each one of them, in the body, just as he desired.</verse>
  <verse number="19">If they were all one member, where would the body be?</verse>
  <verse number="20">But now they are many members, but one body.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The eye can’t tell the hand, “I have no need for you,” or again the head to the feet, “I have no need for you.”</verse>
  <verse number="22">No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Those parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, on those we bestow more abundant honor; and our unpresentable parts have more abundant propriety;</verse>
  <verse number="24">whereas our presentable parts have no such need. But God composed the body together, giving more abundant honor to the inferior part,</verse>
  <verse number="25">that there should be no division in the body, but that the members should have the same care for one another.</verse>
  <verse number="26">When one member suffers, all the members suffer with it. Or when one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.</verse>
  <verse number="28">God has set some in the assembly: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracle workers, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, and various kinds of languages.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Are all miracle workers?</verse>
  <verse number="30">Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with various languages? Do all interpret?</verse>
  <verse number="31">But earnestly desire the best gifts. Moreover, I show a most excellent way to you.</verse>
