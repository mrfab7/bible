<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="23" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, Consider diligently him that is before thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And put a knife to thy throat, If thou be a man given to appetite.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Be not desirous of his dainties; Seeing they are deceitful food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Weary not thyself to be rich; Cease from thine own wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? For riches certainly make themselves wings, Like an eagle that flieth toward heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, Neither desire thou his dainties:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For as he thinketh within himself, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; But his heart is not with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, And lose thy sweet words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Speak not in the hearing of a fool; For he will despise the wisdom of thy words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Remove not the ancient landmark; And enter not into the fields of the fatherless:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For their Redeemer is strong; He will plead their cause against thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Apply thy heart unto instruction, And thine ears to the words of knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Withhold not correction from the child; For if thou beat him with the rod, he will not die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thou shalt beat him with the rod, And shalt deliver his soul from Sheol.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">My son, if thy heart be wise, My heart will be glad, even mine:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Yea, my heart will rejoice, When thy lips speak right things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Let not thy heart envy sinners; But be thou in the fear of Jehovah all the day long:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For surely there is a reward; And thy hope shall not be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Hear thou, my son, and be wise, And guide thy heart in the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Be not among winebibbers, Among gluttonous eaters of flesh:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty; And drowsiness will clothe a man with rags.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, And despise not thy mother when she is old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Buy the truth, and sell it not; Yea, wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice; And he that begetteth a wise child will have joy of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Let thy father and thy mother be glad, And let her that bare thee rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">My son, give me thy heart; And let thine eyes delight in my ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For a harlot is a deep ditch; And a foreign woman is a narrow pit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Yea, she lieth in wait as a robber, And increaseth the treacherous among men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? Who hath complaining? who hath wounds without cause? Who hath redness of eyes?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">They that tarry long at the wine; They that go to seek out mixed wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, When it sparkleth in the cup, When it goeth down smoothly:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">At the last it biteth like a serpent, And stingeth like an adder.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Thine eyes shall behold strange things, And thy heart shall utter perverse things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, Or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not hurt; They have beaten me, and I felt it not: When shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.</p>
