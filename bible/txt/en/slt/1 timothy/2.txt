1	I Beseech therefore, first of all, supplications to be made, prayers, entreaties, thanks, for all men;
2	For kings, and all them being in eminence; that we may lead a gentle and quiet life, in all devotion and gravity.
3	For this good and acceptable before our Saviour God;
4	Who wills all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
5	For one God, and one mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus;
6	Having given himself a ransom for all, a testimony in his own time.
7	For which I was placed a herald, and the sent, (I speak truth in Christ, I lie not;) a teacher of the nations in faith and truth.
8	I will therefore men shall pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without anger and reasoning.
9	And likewise the women in well arranged simplicity, with modesty and discretion, arrange themselves; not in tresses, or gold, or pearls, or expensive clothing;
10	But (what become women professing religious worship) with good works.
11	Let the woman, in freedom from care, learn in all subjection.
12	And I trust not the woman to teach, neither to exercise authority over the man, but to be in freedom from care.
13	For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
14	And Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, was in the transgression.
15	And she shall be saved through the bringing forth children, if they remain in faith and love and consecration with discretion.
