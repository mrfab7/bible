<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My spirit shall be wasted, my days shall be shortened, and only the grave remaineth for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I have not sinned, and my eye abideth in bitterness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Deliver me O Lord, and set me beside thee, and let any manâ€™s hand fight against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thou hast set their heart far from understanding, therefore they shall not be exalted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He promiseth a prey to his companions, and the eyes of his children shall fail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He hath made me as it were a byword of the people, and I am an example before them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">My eye is dim through indignation, and my limbs are brought as it were to nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The just shall be astonished at this, and the innocent shall be raised up against the hypocrite.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the just man shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Wherefore be you all converted, and come, and I shall not find among you any wise man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My days have passed away, my thoughts are dissipated, tormenting my heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They have turned night into day, and after darkness I hope for light again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I wait hell is my house, and I have made my bed in darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If I have said to rottenness: Thou art my father; to worms, my mother and my sister.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Where is now then my expectation, and who considereth my patience?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">All that I have shall go down into the deepest pit: thinkest thou that there at least I shall have rest?</p>
