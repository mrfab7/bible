  <verse number="1">An empty vine is Israel, Fruit he maketh like to himself, According to the abundance of his fruit, He hath multiplied for the altars, According to the goodness of his land, They have made goodly standing-pillars.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Their heart hath been divided, now they are guilty, He doth break down their altars, He doth destroy their standing-pillars.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For now they say: We have no king, Because we have not feared Jehovah, And the king—what doth he for us?</verse>
  <verse number="4">They have spoken words, To swear falsehood in making a covenant, And flourished as a poisonous herb hath judgment, on the furrows of a field.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For the calves of Beth-Aven fear do inhabitants of Samaria, Surely mourned on account of it hath its people, And its priests on account of it leap about, Because of its honour, for it hath removed from it,</verse>
  <verse number="6">Also it to Asshur is carried, a present to a warlike king, Shame doth Ephraim receive, And ashamed is Israel of its own counsel.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Cut off is Samaria! Its king is as a chip on the face of the waters.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And destroyed have been high places of Aven, the sin of Israel. Thorn and bramble go up on their altars, And they have said to hills, Cover us, And to heights, Fall upon us.</verse>
  <verse number="9">From the days of Gibeah thou hast sinned, O Israel, There they have stood, Not overtake them in Gibeah doth battle, Because of sons of perverseness.</verse>
  <verse number="10">When I desire, then I do bind them, And gathered against them have peoples, When they bind themselves to their two iniquities.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Ephraim is a trained heifer—loving to thresh, And I—I have passed over on the goodness of its neck, I cause one to ride Ephraim, Plough doth Judah, harrow for him doth Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Sow for yourselves in righteousness, Reap according to loving-kindness, Till for yourselves tillage of knowledge, To seek Jehovah, Till he come and shew righteousness to you.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Ye have ploughed wickedness, Perversity ye have reaped, Ye have eaten the fruit of lying, For thou hast trusted in thy way, In the abundance of thy might.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And rise doth a tumult among thy people, And all thy fortresses are spoiled, As the spoiling of Shalman of Beth-Arbel, In a day of battle, Mother against sons dashed in pieces.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thus hath Beth-El done to you, Because of the evil of your wickedness, In the dawn cut off utterly is a king of Israel!</verse>
