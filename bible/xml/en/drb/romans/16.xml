  <verse number="26">(Which now is made manifest by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the precept of the eternal God, for the obedience of faith,) known among all nations;</verse>
  <verse number="27">To God the only wise, through Jesus Christ, to whom be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
