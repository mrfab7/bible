  <verse number="3">She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Whoso [is] simple, let him turn in hither: [as for] him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine [which] I have mingled.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked [man getteth] himself a blot.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Give [instruction] to a wise [man], and he will be yet wiser: teach a just [man], and he will increase in learning.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The fear of the LORD [is] the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy [is] understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.</verse>
  <verse number="12">If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but [if] thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear [it].</verse>
  <verse number="13">A foolish woman [is] clamorous: [she is] simple, and knoweth nothing.</verse>

  <verse number="15">To call passengers who go right on their ways:</verse>
  <verse number="16">Whoso [is] simple, let him turn in hither: and [as for] him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</verse>
  <verse number="17">Stolen waters are sweet, and bread [eaten] in secret is pleasant.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But he knoweth not that the dead [are] there; [and that] her guests [are] in the depths of hell.</verse>
