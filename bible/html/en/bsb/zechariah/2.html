<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then I lifted up my eyes and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Where are you going?” I asked. “To measure Jerusalem,” he replied, “and to determine its width and length.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then the angel who was speaking with me went forth, and another angel came forward to meet him</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and said to him, “Run and tell that young man: ‘Jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the multitude of men and livestock within it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For I will be a wall of fire around it, declares the LORD, and I will be the glory within it.’”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">“Get up! Get up! Flee from the land of the north,” declares the LORD, “for I have scattered you like the four winds of heaven,” declares the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">“Get up, O Zion! Escape, you who dwell with the Daughter of Babylon!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For this is what the LORD of Hosts says: “After His Glory has sent Me against the nations that have plundered you—for whoever touches you touches the apple of His eye—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I will surely wave My hand over them, so that they will become plunder for their own servants. Then you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">“Shout for joy and be glad, O Daughter of Zion, for I am coming to dwell among you,” declares the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">“On that day many nations will join themselves to the LORD, and they will become My people. I will dwell among you, and you will know that the LORD of Hosts has sent Me to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the LORD will take possession of Judah as His portion in the Holy Land, and He will once again choose Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Be silent before the LORD, all people, for He has roused Himself from His holy dwelling.”</p>
