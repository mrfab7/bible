<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="13" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Oh that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Will ye speak unrighteously for God, and talk deceitfully for him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Will ye respect his person? will ye contend for God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Is it good that he should search you out? or as one deceiveth a man, will ye deceive him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly respect persons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Shall not his excellency make you afraid, and his dread fall upon you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ashes, your defences are defences of clay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what wilt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Wherefore should I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Though he slay me, yet will I wait for him: nevertheless I will maintain my ways before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">This also shall be my salvation; for a godless man shall not come before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Hear diligently my speech, and let my declaration be in your ears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I am righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Who is he that will contend with me? for now shall I hold my peace and give up the ghost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Only do not two things unto me, then will I not hide myself from thy face:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Withdraw thine hand far from me; and let not thy terror make me afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Then call thou, and I will answer; or let me speak, and answer thou me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Wilt thou harass a driven leaf? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to inherit the iniquities of my youth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and markest all my paths; thou drawest thee a line about the soles of my feet:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Though I am like a rotten thing that consumeth, like a garment that is moth-eaten.</p>
