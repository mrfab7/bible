<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The unjust are overthrown, and they are not: and the house of the just shall stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">According to the mouth of understanding a man shall be praised: and he being perverse of heart shall be for contempt.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The way of the foolish is right in his eyes: and the wise one heard to counsel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The foolish one in the day shall make known his anger: but the prudent one covered dishonor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He breathing out faithfulness will announce justice: and a witness of falsehoods, deceit.</p>
