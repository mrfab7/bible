<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job addeth to lift up his simile, and saith:—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">God liveth! He turned aside my judgment, And the Mighty—He made my soul bitter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For all the while my breath is in me, And the spirit of God in my nostrils.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">My lips do not speak perverseness, And my tongue doth not utter deceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Pollution to me—if I justify you, Till I expire I turn not aside mine integrity from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">On my righteousness I have laid hold, And I do not let it go, My heart doth not reproach me while I live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">As the wicked is my enemy, And my withstander as the perverse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For what is the hope of the profane, When He doth cut off? When God doth cast off his soul?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">His cry doth God hear, When distress cometh on him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">On the Mighty doth he delight himself? Call God at all times?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I shew you by the hand of God, That which is with the Mighty I hide not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Lo, ye—all of you—have seen, And why is this—ye are altogether vain?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">This is the portion of wicked man with God, And the inheritance of terrible ones From the Mighty they receive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If his sons multiply—for them is a sword. And his offspring are not satisfied with bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">His remnant in death are buried, And his widows do not weep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If he heap up as dust silver, And as clay prepare clothing,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He prepareth—and the righteous putteth it on, And the silver the innocent doth apportion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He hath built as a moth his house, And as a booth a watchman hath made.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Rich he lieth down, and he is not gathered, His eyes he hath opened, and he is not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Overtake him as waters do terrors, By night stolen him away hath a whirlwind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Take him up doth an east wind, and he goeth, And it frighteneth him from his place,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And it casteth at him, and doth not spare, From its hand he diligently fleeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">It clappeth at him its hands, And it hisseth at him from his place.</p>
