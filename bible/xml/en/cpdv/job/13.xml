<chapter book="Job" number="13" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Behold, my eye has seen all these things, and my ear has heard, and I have understood each one.</verse>
  <verse number="2">In conformity with your knowledge, I also know. I am not inferior to you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Yet I speak this way to the Almighty, and I desire to argue with God,</verse>
  <verse number="4">having first shown that you fabricate lies and cultivate perverse teachings.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And I wish that you would remain silent, so that you would be counted among the wise.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Therefore, listen to my correction, and pay attention to the judgment of my lips.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Does God require your lie, so that you would speak deceitfully for him?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Have you taken his place, and do you struggle to give judgment in favor of God?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Or, will it please him, from whom nothing can be concealed? Or, will he be deceived, like a man, by your deceitfulness?</verse>
  <verse number="10">He will accuse you because in secret you have preempted his presence.</verse>
  <verse number="11">As soon as he moves himself, he will disturb you, and his dread will fall over you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Your remembrance will be compared to ashes, and your necks will be reduced to clay.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Be silent for a little while, so that I may speak whatever my mind suggests to me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Why do I wound my flesh with my teeth, and carry my soul in my hands?</verse>
  <verse number="15">And now, if he would kill me, I will hope in him; in this, truly, I will correct my ways in his sight.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he will be my savior, for no hypocrite at all will approach in his sight.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Listen to my words, and perceive an enigma with your ears.</verse>
  <verse number="18">If I will be judged, I know that I will be found to be just.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Who is it that will go to judgment with me? Let him approach. Why should I be consumed in silence?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Do not do such things to me twice, and then I will not hide from your face.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Take your hand far away from me, and do not let your dread terrify me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Call me, and I will answer you, or else I will speak, and you can answer me.</verse>
  <verse number="23">How many iniquities and sins do I have? Reveal my crimes and offenses to me.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Why do you conceal your face and consider me to be your enemy?</verse>
  <verse number="25">Against a leaf, which is carried away by the wind, you reveal your power, and you pursue dry straw.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For you write bitter things against me, and you want to consume me for the sins of my youth.</verse>
  <verse number="27">You have put my feet on a tether, and you have observed all my paths, and you have considered the steps of my feet.</verse>
  <verse number="28">I will be left to decay like something rotten and like a garment that is being eaten by moths.</verse>
