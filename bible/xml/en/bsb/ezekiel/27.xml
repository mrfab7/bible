  <verse number="1">Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Now you, son of man, take up a lament for Tyre.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Tell Tyre, who dwells at the gateway to the sea, merchant of the peoples on many coasts, that this is what the Lord GOD says: You have said, O Tyre, ‘I am perfect in beauty.’</verse>
  <verse number="4">Your borders are in the heart of the seas; your builders perfected your beauty.</verse>
  <verse number="5">They constructed all your planking with cypress from Senir. They took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Of oaks from Bashan they made your oars; of wood from the coasts of Cyprus they made your deck, inlaid with ivory.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Of embroidered fine linen from Egypt they made your sail, which served as your banner. Of blue and purple from the coasts of Elishah they made your awning.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The men of Sidon and Arvad were your oarsmen. Your men of skill, O Tyre, were there as your captains.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The elders of Gebal were aboard as shipwrights, repairing your leaks. All the ships of the sea and their sailors came alongside to barter for your merchandise.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Men of Persia, Lydia, and Put served as warriors in your army. They hung their shields and helmets on your walls; they gave you splendor.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Men of Arvad and Helech manned your walls all around, and the men of Gammad were in your towers. They hung their shields around your walls; they perfected your beauty.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Tarshish was your merchant because of your great wealth of goods; they exchanged silver, iron, tin, and lead for your wares.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Javan, Tubal, and Meshech were your merchants. They exchanged slaves and bronze utensils for your merchandise.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The men of Beth-togarmah exchanged horses, war horses, and mules for your wares.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The men of Dedan were your clients; many coastlands were your market; they paid you with ivory tusks and ebony.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Aram was your customer because of your many products; they exchanged turquoise, purple, embroidered work, fine linen, coral, and rubies for your wares.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Judah and the land of Israel traded with you; they exchanged wheat from Minnith, cakes and honey, oil and balm for your merchandise.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Because of your many products and your great wealth of goods, Damascus traded with you wine from Helbon, wool from Zahar,</verse>
  <verse number="19">and casks of wine from Izal for your wares. Wrought iron, cassia, and sweet cane were exchanged for your merchandise.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Dedan was your merchant in saddlecloths for riding.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Arabia and all the princes of Kedar were your customers, trading in lambs, rams, and goats.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The merchants of Sheba and Raamah traded with you; for your wares they exchanged gold, the finest of all spices, and precious stones.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Haran, Canneh, and Eden traded with you, and so did the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad.</verse>
  <verse number="24">In your marketplace they traded with you fine garments of blue, embroidered work, and multicolored rugs with cords tightly twisted and knotted.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The ships of Tarshish carried your merchandise. And you were filled with heavy cargo in the heart of the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Your oarsmen have brought you onto the high seas, but the east wind will shatter you in the heart of the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Your wealth, wares, and merchandise, your sailors, captains, and shipwrights, your merchants and all the warriors within you, with all the other people on board, will sink into the heart of the sea on the day of your downfall.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The countryside will shake when your sailors cry out.</verse>
  <verse number="29">All who handle the oars will abandon their ships. The sailors and all the captains of the sea will stand on the shore.</verse>
  <verse number="30">They will raise their voices for you and cry out bitterly. They will throw dust on their heads and roll in ashes.</verse>
  <verse number="31">They will shave their heads for you and wrap themselves in sackcloth. They will weep over you with anguish of soul and bitter mourning.</verse>
  <verse number="32">As they wail and mourn over you, they will take up a lament for you: ‘Who was ever like Tyre, silenced in the middle of the sea?</verse>
  <verse number="33">When your wares went out to sea, you satisfied many nations. You enriched the kings of the earth with your abundant wealth and merchandise.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Now you are shattered by the seas in the depths of the waters; your merchandise and the people among you have gone down with you.</verse>
  <verse number="35">All the people of the coastlands are appalled over you. Their kings shudder with fear; their faces are contorted.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Those who trade among the nations hiss at you; you have come to a horrible end and will be no more.’”</verse>
