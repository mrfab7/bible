<p class="verse" data-verse="1">These things the Lord God shewed to me: and behold the locust was formed in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter rain, and lo, it was the latter rain after the king’s mowing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, I said: O Lord God, be merciful, I beseech thee: who shall raise up Jacob, for he is very little?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The Lord had pity upon this: It shall not be, said the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">These things the Lord God shewed to me: and behold the Lord called for judgment unto fire, and it devoured the great deep, and ate up a part at the same time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And I said: O Lord God, cease, I beseech thee, who shall raise up Jacob, for he is a little one?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The Lord had pity upon this. Yea this also shall not be, said the Lord God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">These things the Lord shewed to me: and behold the Lord was standing upon a plastered wall, and in his hand a mason’s trowel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the Lord said to me: What seest thou, Amos? And I said: A mason’s trowel. And the Lord said: Behold, I will lay down the trowel in the midst of my people Israel. I will plaster them over no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the high places of the idol shall be thrown down, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste: and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Amasias the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying: Amos hath rebelled against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For thus saith Amos: Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall be carried away captive out of their own land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Amasias said to Amos: Thou seer, go, flee away into the land of Juda: and eat bread there, and prophesy there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But prophesy not again any more in Bethel: because it is the king’s sanctuary, and it is the house of the kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Amos answered and said to Amasias: I am not a prophet, nor am I the son of a prophet: but I am a herdsman plucking wild figs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the Lord took me when I followed the flock, and the Lord said to me: Go, prophesy to my people Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And now hear thou the word of the Lord: Thou sayest, thou shalt not prophesy against Israel, and thou shalt not drop thy word upon the house of the idol.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Therefore thus saith the Lord: Thy wife shall play the harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be measured by a line: and thou shalt die in a polluted land, and Israel shall go into captivity out of their land.</p>
