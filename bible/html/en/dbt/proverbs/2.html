<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, if thou receivest my words, and layest up my commandments with thee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom [and] thou apply thy heart to understanding;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">yea, if thou criest after discernment [and] liftest up thy voice to understanding;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">if thou seekest her as silver and searchest for her as for hidden treasures:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, and find the knowledge of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For Jehovah giveth wisdom; out of his mouth [come] knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright; [he] is a shield to them that walk in integrity;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">guarding the paths of just judgment and keeping the way of his godly ones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity: every good path.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">When wisdom entereth into thy heart and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">discretion shall keep thee, understanding shall preserve thee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">To deliver thee from the way of evil, from the man that speaketh froward things;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">[from those] who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">who rejoice to do evil, [and] delight in the frowardness of evil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">whose paths are crooked, and who are perverted in their course:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">To deliver thee from the strange woman, from the stranger who flattereth with her words;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">who forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">â€”for her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">none that go unto her return again, neither do they attain to the paths of life:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">that thou mayest walk in the way of the good, And keep the paths of the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">but the wicked shall be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful shall be plucked up out of it.</p>
