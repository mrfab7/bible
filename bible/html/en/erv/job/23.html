<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Even today is my complaint rebellious: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Oh that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his seat!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? Nay; but he would give heed unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">There the upright might reason with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">On the left hand, when he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But he knoweth the way that I take; when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My foot hath held fast to his steps; his way have I kept, and turned not aside.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I have not gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured up the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For he performeth that which is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Therefore am I troubled at his presence; when I consider, I am afraid of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For God hath made my heart faint, and the Almighty hath troubled me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither did he cover the thick darkness from my face.</p>
