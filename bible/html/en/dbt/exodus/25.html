<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me a heave-offering: of every one whose heart prompteth him, ye shall take my heave-offering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And this is the heave-offering that ye shall take of them: gold, and silver, and copper,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and byssus, and goats’ [hair],</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and rams’ skins dyed red, and badgers’ skins; and acacia-wood;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">oil for the light; spices for the anointing oil, and for the incense of fragrant drugs;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And they shall make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">According to all that I shall shew thee, the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the utensils thereof, even so shall ye make [it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And they shall make an ark of acacia-wood; two cubits and a half the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold: inside and outside shalt thou overlay it; and shalt make upon it a border of gold round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And cast four rings of gold for it, and put [them] at the four corners thereof, that two rings may be upon the one side thereof and two rings upon the other side thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And make staves of acacia-wood and overlay them with gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And put the staves into the rings upon the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not come out from it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony that I shall give thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And thou shalt make a mercy-seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And thou shalt make two cherubim of gold; [of] beaten work shalt thou make them, at the two ends of the mercy-seat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And make one cherub at the end of the one side, and one cherub at the end of the other side; out of the mercy-seat shall ye make the cherubim at the two ends thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the cherubim shall stretch out [their] wings over it, covering over with their wings the mercy-seat, and their faces opposite to one another: toward the mercy-seat shall the faces of the cherubim be [turned].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And thou shalt put the mercy-seat above on the ark, and shalt put in the ark the testimony that I shall give thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And there will I meet with thee, and will speak with thee from above the mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, everything that I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And thou shalt make a table of acacia-wood, two cubits the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make upon it a border of gold round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And thou shalt make for it a margin of a handbreadth round about, and shalt make a border of gold for the margin thereof round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings at the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Close to the margin shall the rings be, as receptacles of the staves to carry the table.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And thou shalt make the staves of acacia-wood, and overlay them with gold; and the table shall be carried upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and cups thereof, and goblets thereof, and bowls thereof, with which to pour out: of pure gold shalt thou make them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me continually.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And thou shalt make a lamp-stand of pure gold; [of] beaten work shall the lamp-stand be made: its base and its shaft, its cups, its knobs, and its flowers shall be of the same.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And six branches shall come out of the sides thereof—three branches of the lamp-stand out of one side thereof, and three branches of the lamp-stand out of the other side thereof;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">three cups shaped like almonds in the one branch, a knob and a flower: and three cups shaped like almonds in the other branch, a knob and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the lamp-stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And in the lamp-stand four cups shaped like almonds, its knobs and its flowers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">and a knob under two branches of it, and [again] a knob under two branches of it, and [again] a knob under two branches of it, for the six branches that proceed out of the lamp-stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Their knobs and their branches shall be of itself—all of one beaten work of pure gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof, and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may shine out before it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">and the snuffers thereof, and the snuff-trays thereof, of pure gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Of a talent of pure gold shall they make it, with all these utensils.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And see that thou make [them] according to their pattern, which hath been shewn to thee in the mountain.</p>
