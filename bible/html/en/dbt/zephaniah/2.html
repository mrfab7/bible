<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Collect yourselves and gather together, O nation without shame,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">before the decree bring forth, [before] the day pass away as chaff, before the fierce anger of Jehovah come upon you, before the day of Jehovah’s anger come upon you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Seek Jehovah, all ye meek of the land, who have performed his ordinance; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye shall be hid in the day of Jehovah’s anger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For Gazah shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon shall be a desolation; they shall drive out Ashdod at noonday, and Ekron shall be rooted up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea-coast, the nation of the Cherethites! The word of Jehovah is against you, O Canaan, land of the Philistines: I will destroy thee, that there shall be no inhabitant;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and the sea-coast shall be cave-dwellings for shepherds, and folds for flocks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they lie down in the evening: for Jehovah their God shall visit them, and turn again their captivity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the children of Ammon, wherewith they have reproached my people, and magnified themselves against their border.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Therefore, [as] I live, saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, Moab shall certainly be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, a possession of nettles, and salt-pits, and a perpetual desolation; the remnant of my people shall spoil them, and the residue of my nation shall possess them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of Jehovah of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Jehovah will be terrible unto them; for he will famish all the gods of the earth; and all the isles of the nations shall worship him, every one from his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be the slain of my sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, a place of drought like the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the crowd of beasts; both the pelican and the bittern shall lodge in the chapiters thereof; a voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be on the thresholds: for he hath laid bare the cedar work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">This is the rejoicing city that dwelt in security, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none else beside me: how is she become a desolation, a couching-place for beasts! Every one that passeth by her shall hiss, shall wave his hand.</p>
