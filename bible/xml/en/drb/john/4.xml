  <verse number="1">WHEN Jesus therefore understood that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus maketh more disciples, and baptizeth more than John,</verse>
  <verse number="2">(Though Jesus himself did not baptize, but his disciples,)</verse>
  <verse number="3">He left Judea, and went again into Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he was of necessity to pass through Samaria.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He cometh therefore to a city of Samaria, which is called Sichar, near the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
  <verse number="7">There cometh a woman of Samaria, to draw water. Jesus saith to her: Give me to drink.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For his disciples were gone into the city to buy meats.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then that Samaritan woman saith to him: How dost thou, being a Jew, ask of me to drink, who am a Samaritan woman? For the Jews do not communicate with the Samaritans.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Jesus answered, and said to her: If thou didst know the gift of God, and who he is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou perhaps wouldst have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The woman saith to him: Sir, thou hast nothing wherein to draw, and the well is deep; from whence then hast thou living water?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Jesus answered, and said to her: Whosoever drinketh of this water, shall thirst again; but he that shall drink of the water that I will give him, shall not thirst for ever:</verse>
  <verse number="14">But the water that I will give him, shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into life everlasting.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The woman saith to him: Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Jesus saith to her: Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The woman answered, and said: I have no husband. Jesus said to her: Thou hast said well, I have no husband:</verse>
  <verse number="18">For thou hast had five husbands: and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband. This thou hast said truly.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The woman saith to him: Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Our fathers adored on this mountain, and you say, that at Jerusalem is the place where men must adore.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Jesus saith to her: Woman, believe me, that the hour cometh, when you shall neither on this mountain, not in Jerusalem, adore the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="22">You adore that which you know not: we adore that which we know; for salvation is of the Jews.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true adorers shall adore the Father in spirit and in truth. For the Father also seeketh such to adore him.</verse>
  <verse number="24">God is a spirit; and they that adore him, must adore him in spirit and in truth.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The woman saith to him: I know that the Messias cometh (who is called Christ); therefore, when he is come, he will tell us all things.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Jesus saith to her: I am he, who am speaking with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And immediately his disciples came; and they wondered that he talked with the woman. Yet no man said: What seekest thou? or, why talkest thou with her?</verse>
  <verse number="28">The woman therefore left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men there:</verse>
  <verse number="29">Come, and see a man who has told me all things whatsoever I have done. Is not he the Christ?</verse>
  <verse number="30">They went therefore out of the city, and came unto him.</verse>
  <verse number="31">In the mean time the disciples prayed him, saying: Rabbi, eat.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But he said to them: I have meat to eat, which you know not.</verse>
  <verse number="33">The disciples therefore said one to another: Hath any man brought him to eat?</verse>
  <verse number="34">Jesus saith to them: My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, that I may perfect his work.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Do you not say, There are yet four months, and then the harvest cometh? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes, and see the countries; for they are white already to harvest.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life everlasting: that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, may rejoice together.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For in this is the saying true: That it is one man that soweth, and it is another that reapeth.</verse>
  <verse number="38">I have sent you to reap that in which you did not labour: others have laboured, and you have entered into their labours.</verse>
  <verse number="39">Now of that city many of the Samaritans believed in him, for the word of the woman giving testimony: He told me all things whatsoever I have done.</verse>
  <verse number="40">So when the Samaritans were come to him, they desired that he would tarry there. And he abode there two days.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And many more believed in him because of his own word.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And they said to the woman: We now believe, not for thy saying: for we ourselves have heard him, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Now after two days, he departed thence, and went into Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="44">For Jesus himself gave testimony that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And when he was come into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all the things he had done at Jerusalem on the festival day; for they also went to the festival day.</verse>
  <verse number="46">He came again therefore into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain ruler, whose son was sick at Capharnaum.</verse>
  <verse number="47">He having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into Galilee, went to him, and prayed him to come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.</verse>
  <verse number="48">Jesus therefore said to him: Unless you see signs and wonders, you believe not.</verse>
  <verse number="49">The ruler saith to him: Lord, come down before that my son die.</verse>
  <verse number="50">Jesus saith to him: Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went his way.</verse>
  <verse number="51">And as he was going down, his servants met him; and they brought word, saying, that his son lived.</verse>
  <verse number="52">He asked therefore of them the hour wherein he grew better. And they said to him: Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.</verse>
  <verse number="53">The father therefore knew, that it was at the same hour that Jesus said to him, Thy son liveth; and himself believed, and his whole house.</verse>
  <verse number="54">This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judea into Galilee.</verse>
