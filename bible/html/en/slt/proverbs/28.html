<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The unjust fled and none pursuing, and the just shall be confident as the young lion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">In the transgression of a land many its chiefs: and by a man understanding to know, the place shall be extended.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A poor man oppressing the poor, a sweeping rain and no bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">They forsaking the law will praise the unjust: and they watching the law, shall contend with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Men of evil shall not understand judgment: and they seeking Jehovah shall understand all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Good the poor one going in his integrity above him perverting the ways, and he the rich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He watching the law a son understanding: and the companion of squanderers will shame his father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He increasing by interest and usury, he shall gather it for him compassionating the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He turning away his ear from hearing the law, also his prayer is an abomination.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He causing the upright to wander in an evil way, into his pit shall he fall: and the good shall inherit complete things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The rich man is wise in his eyes, and the poor one understanding shall search him out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">In the rejoicing of the just, much glory: in the rising up of the unjust, man will hide himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He covering his transgression shall not prosper: but he confessing and forsaking, shall be compassionated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Happy the man fearing always: and he hardening his heart shall fall into evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">A roaring lion and a greedy bear the unjust one ruling over a poor people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A prince wanting understanding and great in oppressions: he hating gain shall lengthen the days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He terrifying violence upon the blood of a soul shall flee even to the pit; none shall hold fast upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He going uprightly shall be saved; and he being violent in the ways shall fall at once.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He working his land shall be filled with bread: and he pursuing the vain shall be filled with poverty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A man of faithfulness multiplied blessings: and he hasting to be rich shall not be innocent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">To look upon faces is not good and for a morsel of bread the man will transgress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A man of evil eye hasted for riches, and knew not that want shall come upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He reproving a man, afterwards shall find favor more than he smoothing the tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He stripping his father and his mother, and saying, No transgression; is companion to a man destroying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He enlarging the soul shall excite strife: and he trusting upon Jehovah shall he made fat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He trusting in his heart is foolish: and he going in wisdom shall be delivered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He giving to the poor wants not: and he hiding his eyes increased curses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">In the rising up of the unjust, man shalt hide: and in their perishing, the lust shall increase.</p>
