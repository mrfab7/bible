<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="33" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Why, Job, I pray you, hear my speeches, and listen to all my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue has spoken in my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty has given me life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If you can answer me, set your words in order before me, stand up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Behold, I am according to your wish in God’s stead: I also am formed out of the clay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, my terror shall not make you afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy on you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Surely you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of your words, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Behold, he finds occasions against me, he counts me for his enemy,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He puts my feet in the stocks, he marks all my paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Behold, in this you are not just: I will answer you, that God is greater than man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Why do you strive against him? for he gives not account of any of his matters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For God speaks once, yes twice, yet man perceives it not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, in slumberings on the bed;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Then he opens the ears of men, and seals their instruction,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He keeps back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He is chastened also with pain on his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">So that his life abhors bread, and his soul dainty meat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Yes, his soul draws near to the grave, and his life to the destroyers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show to man his uprightness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Then he is gracious to him, and said, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s: he shall return to the days of his youth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He shall pray to God, and he will be favorable to him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render to man his righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He looks on men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">See, all these things works God oftentimes with man,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Mark well, O Job, listen to me: hold your peace, and I will speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">If you have anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If not, listen to me: hold your peace, and I shall teach you wisdom.</p>
