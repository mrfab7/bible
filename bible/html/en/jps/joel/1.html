<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear this, ye old men, And give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land. Hath this been in your days, Or in the days of your fathers?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Tell ye your children of it, And let your children tell their children, And their children another generation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">That which the palmer-worm hath left hath the locust eaten; And that which the locust hath left hath the canker-worm eaten; And that which the canker-worm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Awake, ye drunkards, and weep, And wail, all ye drinkers of wine, Because of the sweet wine, For it is cut off from your mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For a people is come up upon my land, Mighty, and without number; His teeth are the teeth of a lion, And he hath the jaw-teeth of a lioness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He hath laid my vine waste, And blasted my fig-tree; He hath made it clean bare, and cast it down, The branches thereof are made white.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth For the husband of her youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The meal-offering and the drink-offering is cut off From the house of the LORD; The priests mourn, Even the LORDâ€™S ministers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The field is wasted, The land mourneth; For the corn is wasted, The new wine is dried up, The oil languisheth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Be ashamed, O ye husbandmen, Wail, O ye vinedressers, For the wheat and for the barley; Because the harvest of the field is perished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The vine is withered, And the fig-tree languisheth; The pomegranate-tree, the palm-tree also, and the apple-tree, Even all the trees of the field, are withered; For joy is withered away from the sons of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests, Wail, ye ministers of the altar; Come, lie all night in sackcloth, Ye ministers of my God; For the meal-offering and the drink-offering is withholden From the house of your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Sanctify ye a fast, Call a solemn assembly, Gather the elders And all the inhabitants of the land Unto the house of the LORD your God, And cry unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Alas for the day! For the day of the LORD is at hand, And as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Is not the food cut off Before our eyes, Yea, joy and gladness From the house of our God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The grains shrivel under their hoes; The garners are laid desolate, The barns are broken down; For the corn is withered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">How do the beasts groan! The herds of cattle are perplexed, Because they have no pasture; Yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Unto Thee, O LORD, do I cry; For the fire hath devoured The pastures of the wilderness, And the flame hath set ablaze All the trees of the field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Yea, the beasts of the field pant unto Thee; For the water brooks are dried up, And the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.</p>
