<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And he said to them, Truly I say to you, That some of those are standing here, who should not taste of death, till they see the kingdom of God having come in power.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And after six days Jesus takes Peter, and James, and John, and brings them up into a high mountain apart alone: and he was transformed before them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And his garments were shining, exceeding white, such as no fuller on earth can make white.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Elias was seen to them, with Moses: and they were speaking together with Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Peter having answered, says to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tents; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For he knew not what he said; for they were terrified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And a cloud was overshadowing them: and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my dearly beloved Son: hear ye him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And suddenly, having looked around, they no more saw any one, but Jesus alone with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And they coming down from the mount, he charged them that they recount to none what they saw, except when the Son of man should arise from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And they held the word firmly to themselves, searching out together what it is to arise from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And having asked him, saying, That the scribes say that Elias must first come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And he having answered, said to them, Elias truly having first come, restores all things; and how it has been written of the Son of man, that he suffer many things; and be set at nought.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But I say to you, that Elias also has come, and they did to him whatever they would, as it has been written of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And having come to the disciples, he saw a great crowd about them, and the scribes seeking out with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And immediately all the crowd; having seen him, were amazed, and running near greeted him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he asked the scribes, What seek ye together with them?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And one from the crowd having answered, said, Teacher, I have brought my son to thee, having a speechless spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And wherever he overtakes him, he rends him: and he foams, and gnashes his teeth, and he is dried up: and I spake to thy disciples that they might cast him out; and they could not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And he having answered, says to him, O faithless generation, how long shall I be with you how long shall I bear with you? bring him to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And they brought him to him: and having seen him, quickly the spirit rent him; and having fallen upon the earth, foaming he rolled himself about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And he asked his father, How long is it that this has been to him? And he said, From childhood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And many times also it cast him into fire, and into water, that it might destroy him; but if thou canst anything, help us, having had compassion upon us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Jesus said to him, If thou canst believe, all things possible to him believing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And quickly the childâ€™s father having cried out with tears, said, I believe, O Lord, help thou mine unbelief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Jesus, having seen that the crowd ran together, rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, Speechless and deaf spirit, I command thee to come out of him, and that thou come no more into him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And having cried and rent him much, it came forth, and he was as dead; so that many said, That he is dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And Jesus having held him by the hand, raised him; and he stood up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And he having come into the house, his disciples asked him apart, Wherefore were we not able to cast him forth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And he said to them, This kind can go, out by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And having come out thence they passed through Galilee; and he desired not that any one should know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For he taught his disciples, and said to them, That the Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him; and having been killed, he shall raise himself the third day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And they knew not the word, and were afraid to ask him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And he came to Capernaum: and being in the house he asked them, What reasoned ye to yourselves in the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And they were silent; for they discussed to one another in the way, who the greatest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And having sat down, he called the twelve, and says to them, If any wish to be first, he shall be last of all, and servant of all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And having taken a young child, he set him in the midst of them: and having taken it up in his arms, he said to them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Whoever should receive ones of such young children in my name, receives me: and whoever should receive me, receives not me, but him sending me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And John answered him, saying, Teacher, we saw a certain one casting out demons in thy name, who follows not us: and we checked him, for he follows not us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And Jesus said, Check him not: for there is no one who shall do power in my name, and shall be able quickly to revile me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">For whoever is not against us, is for us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">For whoever should give you to drink a cup of water in my name, because ye are of Christ, verily I say to you, he should not lose his reward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And whoever should scandalize one of these little ones believing in me, it is good for him rather if a millstone is put about his neck, and he be cast into the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off; it is good for thee rather to enter into life maimed, than having two hands, to go away into hell, into inextinguishable fire:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: it is good for thee to enter into life lame, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into inextinguishable fire:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">And if thine eye offend thee, cast it out: it is good for thee, one-eyed, to come into the kingdom of God, than having two eyes to be cast into a hell of fire:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">For all shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">Salt good: but if the salt be saltless, with what will ye prepare it? Have salt in yourselves, and live in peace one with another.</p>
