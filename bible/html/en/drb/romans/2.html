<p class="verse" data-verse="1">WHEREFORE thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest. For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself. For thou dost the same things which thou judgest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For we know that the judgment of God is, according to truth, against them that do such things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such things, and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and patience, and longsuffering? Knowest thou not, that the benignity of God leadeth thee to penance?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up to thyself wrath, against the day of wrath, and revelation of the just judgment of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Who will render to every man according to his works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">To them indeed, who according to patience in good work, seek glory and honour and incorruption, eternal life:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But to them that are contentious, and who obey not the truth, but give credit to iniquity, wrath and indignation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But glory, and honour, and peace to every one that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For there is no respect of persons with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For whosoever have sinned without the law, shall perish without the law; and whosoever have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature those things that are of the law; these having not the law are a law to themselves:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Who shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to them, and their thoughts between themselves accusing, or also defending one another,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But if thou art called a Jew and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And knowest his will, and approvest the more profitable things, being instructed by the law,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Thou therefore that teachest another, teachest not thyself: thou that preachest that men should not steal, stealest:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Thou that sayest, men should not commit adultery, committest adultery: thou that abhorrest idols, committest sacrilege:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Thou that makest thy boast of the law, by transgression of the law dishonourest God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">(For the name of God through you is blasphemed among the Gentiles, as it is written.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Circumcision profiteth indeed, if thou keep the law; but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">If, then, the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law, shall not this uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And shall not that which by nature is uncircumcision, if it fulfil the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For it is not he is a Jew, who is so outwardly; nor is that circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">But he is a Jew, that is one inwardly; and the circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.</p>
