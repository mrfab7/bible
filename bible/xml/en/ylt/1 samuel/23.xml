  <verse number="17">and saith unto him, ‘Fear not, for the hand of Saul my father doth not find thee, and thou dost reign over Israel, and I am to thee for second, and also so knoweth Saul my father.’</verse>

  <verse number="21">And Saul saith, ‘Blessed are ye of Jehovah, for ye have pity on me;</verse>
  <verse number="22">go, I pray you, prepare yet, and know and see his place where his foot is; who hath seen him there? for one hath said unto me, He is very subtile.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And see and know of all the hiding-places where he hideth himself, and ye have turned back unto me prepared, and I have gone with you, and it hath been, if he is in the land, that I have searched him out through all the thousands of Judah.’</verse>
