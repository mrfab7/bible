<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his offering shall be [of] fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, [to be] an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the remnant of the meat offering [shall be] Aaron’s and his sons’: [it is] a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the oven, [it shall be] unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And if thy oblation [be] a meat offering [baken] in a pan, it shall be [of] fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it [is] a meat offering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And if thy oblation [be] a meat offering [baken] in the fryingpan, it shall be made [of] fine flour with oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the altar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn [it] upon the altar: [it is] an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And that which is left of the meat offering [shall be] Aaron’s and his sons’: [it is] a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, [even] corn beaten out of full ears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it [is] a meat offering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, [part] of the beaten corn thereof, and [part] of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: [it is] an offering made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
