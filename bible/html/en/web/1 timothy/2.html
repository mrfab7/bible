<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Timothy" data-chapter="2" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I exhort therefore, first of all, that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and givings of thanks, be made for all men:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">for kings and all who are in high places; that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and reverence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">who desires all people to be saved and come to full knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">who gave himself as a ransom for all; the testimony in its own times;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">to which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth in Christ, not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I desire therefore that the men in every place pray, lifting up holy hands without anger and doubting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">In the same way, that women also adorn themselves in decent clothing, with modesty and propriety; not just with braided hair, gold, pearls, or expensive clothing;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">but (which becomes women professing godliness) with good works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But I don’t permit a woman to teach, nor to exercise authority over a man, but to be in quietness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Adam wasn’t deceived, but the woman, being deceived, has fallen into disobedience;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">but she will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and sanctification with sobriety.</p>
