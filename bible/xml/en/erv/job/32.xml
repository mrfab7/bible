<chapter book="Job" number="32" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Now Elihu had waited to speak unto Job, because they were elder than he.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, his wrath was kindled.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I held back, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But there is a spirit in man, and the breath of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="9">It is not the great that are wise, nor the aged that understand judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none that convinced Job, or that answered his words, among you.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Beware lest ye say, We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not man:</verse>
  <verse number="14">For he hath not directed his words against me; neither will I answer him with your speeches.</verse>
  <verse number="15">They are amazed, they answer no more: they have not a word to say.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And shall I wait, because they speak not, because they stand still, and answer no more?</verse>
  <verse number="17">I also will answer my part, I also will shew mine opinion.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For I am full of words; the spirit within me constraineth me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; like new bottles it is ready to burst.</verse>
  <verse number="20">I will speak, that I may be refreshed; I will open my lips and answer.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Let me not, I pray you, respect any man’s person; neither will I give flattering titles unto any man.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For I know not to give flattering titles; else would my Maker soon take me away.</verse>
