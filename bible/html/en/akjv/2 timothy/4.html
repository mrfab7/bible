<div class="chapter" data-book="2 Timothy" data-chapter="4" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I charge you therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned to fables.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But watch you in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of your ministry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">From now on there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but to all them also that love his appearing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Do your diligence to come shortly to me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when you come, bring with you, and the books, but especially the parchments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Of whom be you ware also; for he has greatly withstood our words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me to his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Erastus stayed at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Do your diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>
