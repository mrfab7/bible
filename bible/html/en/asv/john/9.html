<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And as he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Jesus answered, Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">We must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">When I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed his eyes with the clay,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent). He went away therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The neighbors therefore, and they that saw him aforetime, that he was a beggar, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Others said, It is he: others said, No, but he is like him. He said, I am he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They said therefore unto him, How then were thine eyes opened?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He answered, The man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to Siloam, and wash: so I went away and washed, and I received sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And they said unto him, Where is he? He saith, I know not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They bring to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Now it was the sabbath on the day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Again therefore the Pharisees also asked him how he received his sight. And he said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and I see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Some therefore of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he keepeth not the sabbath. But others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">They say therefore unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, in that he opened thine eyes? And he said, He is a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The Jews therefore did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">but how he now seeth, we know not; or who opened his eyes, we know not: ask him; he is of age; he shall speak for himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">These things said his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">So they called a second time the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give glory to God: we know that this man is a sinner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He therefore answered, Whether he is a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">They said therefore unto him, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He answered them, I told you even now, and ye did not hear; wherefore would ye hear it again? would ye also become his disciples?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are disciples of Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">We know that God hath spoken unto Moses: but as for this man, we know not whence he is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is the marvel, that ye know not whence he is, and yet he opened mine eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">We know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and do his will, him he heareth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Since the world began it was never heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">He answered and said, And who is he, Lord, that I may believe on him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and he it is that speaketh with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And Jesus said, For judgment came I into this world, that they that see not may see; and that they that see may become blind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and said unto him, Are we also blind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye would have no sin: but now ye say, We see: your sin remaineth.</p>
