  <verse number="1">Give ear, ye heavens, and I will speak; Thou earth shalt hear the words of my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="2">My doctrine shall drop as the rain; My word shall pour out as the dew, As the showers upon the herbage, And as the rains upon the green herb:</verse>
  <verse number="3">For I will call the name of Jehovah: Give ye greatness to our God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The Rock, his work complete: For all his ways judgment: A God of faithfulness and not of iniquity Just and right is he.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He acted wickedly to him; not his sons their blot: A generation perverted and crooked.</verse>
  <verse number="6">To Jehovah will ye recompense this, A people foolish and not wise? He thy father: did he not buy thee? He made thee, and he will protect thee.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Remember the days of eternity; Discern the years of generation and generation: Ask thy father, and he will announce to thee; Thy old men, and they shall say to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The Most High distributing the nations, In his dispersing the sons of Adam, He set the bounds of the peoples According to the number of the sons of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For Jehovah the portion of his people; Jacob the cord of his inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He will find him in the land of the desert, In a waste howling desolation: He will encompass him about; he will teach him, He will keep him as the pupil of the eye.</verse>
  <verse number="11">As the eagle he will arouse his young brood, He will brood over his young birds; He will spread out his wings, and will take them; He will lift them up upon his wings:</verse>
  <verse number="12">Jehovah alone will lead him, And no strange god with him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He will cause him to ride upon the heights of the land; He shall eat the produce of the field; And he shall suck honey from the rock, And oil from the flint of the rock.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Curdled milk of the cow, and milk of the sheep, With the fat of lambs, And rams, sons of Bashan, and he goats, With the fat of kidneys of wheat; Thou shalt drink wine, the blood of the grape.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Jeshurun will be fat and will tread down: Thou wert fat, thou wert thick, thou wert covered; And he will reject God having made him, And he will despise the Rock of his deliverance.</verse>
  <verse number="16">He will cause him to be jealous with strangers, With abominations they will irritate him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They will sacrifice to demons, not God; Gods they have not known them New ones came out from the midst; Your fathers not having feared them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Thou wilt forsake the Rock begetting thee, And thou wilt forget God setting thee free.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And God will see and will reject, From the irritating of his sons and his daughters.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he will say, I will hide my face from them; I will see what shall be after them: For they a generation of perverseness, Sons no faith in them.</verse>
  <verse number="21">They made me jealous with not God; They irritated me with their vanities: And I will make them jealous with not a people; With a foolish nation will I irritate them.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For a fire was kindled in mine anger. And it shall burn to the lowest hades, And it shall consume the land and its produce, And it shall burn the foundations of the mountains.</verse>
  <verse number="23">I will gather evils upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Exhausted with hunger, consumed with burning, And bitter destruction: And I will send upon them the tooth of beasts, With the wrath of those crawlers of the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The sword shall bereave without, And terror from the chambers, Also the youth, also the virgin, The suckling, with the man of gray hair.</verse>
  <verse number="26">I have said I will blow them away, I will turn away their remembrance from man;</verse>
  <verse number="27">Unless I shall fear the enemy’s their adversaries shall dissemble, Lest they shall say, Our high hand And not Jehovah did all this.</verse>
  <verse number="28">For they a nation destroying counsels, And no understanding in them.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Would they were wise! will they look at this? Will they discern to their latter part?</verse>
  <verse number="30">How shall one chase a thousand; And two shall cause ten thousand to flee, If that their Rock had not sold them, And Jehovah delivered them up?</verse>
  <verse number="31">For their rock not as our Rock, And our enemies judging.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For their vine from the vine of Sodom, And from the fields of Gomorrah: Their grapes the grapes of poverty, The clusters of bitterness to them.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Their wine the wrath of dragons, And the fierce head of asps.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Is not this laid up with me, Sealed up in my treasuries?</verse>
  <verse number="35">To me vengeance and requital; At the time their foot shall waver: For the day of their destruction is near, And he hastened things prepared for them.</verse>
  <verse number="36">For Jehovah will judge his people, And upon his servants will he have compassion; When he shall see that the hand has failed, And nothing detained and left.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And he said, Where their gods, The rock they trusted in it?</verse>
  <verse number="38">Whose fat of their sacrifices they shall eat; They shall drink the wine of their libations They shall rise up, and they shall succor you, It shall be for you protection.</verse>
  <verse number="39">See ye now, that I, I am he, And no God with me: I will kill, and I will preserve alive; I struck through and through, and I will heal; And none takes away out of my hand.</verse>
  <verse number="40">For I will lift up my hand to the heavens, And I said, I live forever.</verse>
  <verse number="41">If I sharpened the lightning of my sword, And my hand shall lay hold upon judgment, I will turn back vengeance to mine adversaries, And to those hating me I will requite,</verse>
  <verse number="42">I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, And my sword shall eat flesh, From the blood of the wounded and the captivity, From the head of the enemy’s leaders.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Rejoice ye nations with him, For he will raise up the blood of his servants, And he will turn back vengeance to his adversaries, And he will expiate for his land, his people.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And Moses will come and speak all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Joshua, son of Nun.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And Moses will finish speaking all these words to all Israel:</verse>
  <verse number="46">And he will say to them, Set your hearts to all the words which I call upon you to witness this day, which ye shall command your sons to watch and to do, all the words of this law.</verse>
  <verse number="47">For it is not an empty word for you, but it is your life; and in this word ye shall prolong the days upon the land which ye pass through Jordan there to inherit it.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And Jehovah will speak to Moses in this self-same day, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="49">Come up to this mountain Abarim, the mountain Nebo, which is in the lend of Moab against the face of Jericho; and see the land of Canaan which I gave to the sons of Israel for a possession.</verse>
  <verse number="50">And die in the mountain which thou earnest there, and be gathered to thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount for and was gathered to his people:</verse>
  <verse number="51">Because ye acted treacherously against me in the midst of the sons of Israel at the waters of contradiction, of Kadesh in the desert Zin; because ye consecrated me not in the midst of the sons of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="52">But thou shalt see the land from before, and thou shalt not come in there to the land which I gave to the sons of Israel.</verse>
