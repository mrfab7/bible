<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I Speak truth in Christ, I lie not, my consciousness bearing witness to me in the Holy Spirit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">That there is great grief to me and continued pain in my heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I myself was praying to be anathema from Christ for my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who are Israelites; whose the adoption as a son, and the glory, and covenants, and legislation, and divine worship, and solemn promises;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Whose the fathers, and from whom Christ according to the flesh, who being God over all, praised forever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And not as that the word of God has fallen through. For not they all of Israel, they which of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Neither that the seed of Abraham, are all children: but, In Isaac shall the seed be called to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">That is, The children of the flesh, these not the children of God: but the children of the solemn promise are reckoned for seed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For this the word of solemn promise, According to this time will I come, and there shall be a son to Sarah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And not only; but also Rebecca, having coition of one, Isaac our father;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">(For not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that according to choice the purpose of God might remain, not of works, but of him calling;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">It was said to her, That the greater shall serve the less.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">As has been written, Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What then shall we say is injustice with God? It may not be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I will commiserate whomsoever I commiserate, and I will have compassion upon whomsoever I have compassion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Surely then, not of him willing, nor of him running, but of God commiserating.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the writing says to Pharaoh, That for this same have I raised thee up, so that I might show in thee my power, and so that my name might be announced in all the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Surely then, whom he will he commiserates, and whom he will he hardens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thou wilt then say to me, Why does he yet blame For who has withstood his will?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Surely, O man, who art thou replying against God? Shall the formation say to him having formed, Why hast thou made me so.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Or has not the potter power over the clay, of the same mixture truly to make one vessel for honour, and one for dishonour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And if God, willing anger to be shown, and his power to be made known, endured in much long suffering the vessels of anger put in proper order for destruction:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And that he might make known the riches of his glory upon the vessels of mercy, which he before prepared for glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Whom he also called us, not only from the Jews, but also of the nations?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">As also he says in Hosea, I will call not my people my people; and the not loved, loved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And it shall be, in the place where it was said to them, Ye not my people; there shall they be called the sons of the living God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And Esaias cries for Israel, If the number of the sons of Israel as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For finishing and cutting short the word in justice: for the Lord will make the word cut short upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us seed, as Sodom had we been, and as Gomorrha had we been likened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">What then shall we say? That the nations, not following justice, overtook justice, and the justice of faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And Israel following the law of justice, reached not the law of justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Wherefore? Because not of faith, but as of the works of the law. For they stumbled at the stumblingstone;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">As has been written, Behold I set in Zion a stone of stumbling and rock of offence: and every one believing on him shall not be ashamed.</p>
