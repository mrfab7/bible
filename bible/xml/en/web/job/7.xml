  <verse number="1">“Isn’t a man forced to labor on earth? Aren’t his days like the days of a hired hand?</verse>
  <verse number="2">As a servant who earnestly desires the shadow, as a hireling who looks for his wages,</verse>
  <verse number="3">so am I made to possess months of misery, wearisome nights are appointed to me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">When I lie down, I say, ‘When shall I arise, and the night be gone?’ I toss and turn until the dawning of the day.</verse>
  <verse number="5">My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust. My skin closes up, and breaks out afresh.</verse>
  <verse number="6">My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and are spent without hope.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Oh remember that my life is a breath. My eye shall no more see good.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The eye of him who sees me shall see me no more. Your eyes shall be on me, but I shall not be.</verse>
  <verse number="9">As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he who goes down to Sheol shall come up no more.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</verse>
  <verse number="11">“Therefore I will not keep silent. I will speak in the anguish of my spirit. I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Am I a sea, or a sea monster, that you put a guard over me?</verse>
  <verse number="13">When I say, ‘My bed shall comfort me. My couch shall ease my complaint;’</verse>
  <verse number="14">then you scare me with dreams, and terrify me through visions:</verse>
  <verse number="15">so that my soul chooses strangling, death rather than my bones.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I loathe my life. I don’t want to live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are but a breath.</verse>
  <verse number="17">What is man, that you should magnify him, that you should set your mind on him,</verse>
  <verse number="18">that you should visit him every morning, and test him every moment?</verse>
  <verse number="19">How long will you not look away from me, nor leave me alone until I swallow down my spittle?</verse>
  <verse number="20">If I have sinned, what do I do to you, you watcher of men? Why have you set me as a mark for you, so that I am a burden to myself?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Why do you not pardon my disobedience, and take away my iniquity? For now shall I lie down in the dust. You will seek me diligently, but I shall not be.”</verse>
