<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Reasoning with unprofitable talk, and with speeches which do no good?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Yea, thou makest piety of none effect, and restrainest meditation before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou hast chosen the tongue of the crafty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; and thy lips testify against thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Art thou the first man that was born? and wast thou brought forth before the hills?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Hast thou listened in the secret council of +God? And hast thou absorbed wisdom for thyself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What knowest thou that we know not? [what] understandest thou which is not in us?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Both the greyheaded and the aged are with us, older than thy father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Are the consolations of God too small for thee? and the word gently spoken to thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Why doth thy heart carry thee away? and why do thine eyes wink?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest words go out of thy mouth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What is man, that he should be pure? and he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold, he putteth no trust in his holy ones, and the heavens are not pure in his sight:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">How much less the abominable and corrupt,—man, that drinketh unrighteousness like water!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I will shew thee, listen to me; and what I have seen I will declare;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hidden;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">All his days the wicked man is tormented, and numbered years are allotted to the violent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The sound of terrors is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer cometh upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is singled out for the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He wandereth abroad for bread,—where may it be? He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Distress and anguish make him afraid; they prevail against him, as a king ready for the battle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For he hath stretched out his hand against God, and strengthened himself against the Almighty:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He runneth against him, with [outstretched] neck, with the thick bosses of his bucklers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For he hath covered his face with his fatness, and gathered fat upon [his] flanks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And he dwelleth in desolate cities, in houses that no man inhabiteth, which are destined to become heaps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He shall not become rich, neither shall his substance continue, and their possessions shall not extend upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches; and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Let him not trust in vanity: he is deceived, for vanity shall be his recompense;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">It shall be complete before his day, and his branch shall not be green.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">He shall shake off his unripe grapes as a vine, and shall cast his flower as an olive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For the family of the ungodly shall be barren, and fire shall consume the tents of bribery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, and their belly prepareth deceit.</p>
