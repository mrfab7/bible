  <verse number="8">And now, take to you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go ye unto My servant Job, and ye have caused a burnt-offering to ascend for you; and Job My servant doth pray for you, for surely his face I accept, so as not to do with you folly, because ye have not spoken concerning Me rightly, like My servant Job.</verse>

  <verse number="14">and he calleth the name of the one Jemima, and the name of the second Kezia, and the name of the third Keren-Happuch.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And there have not been found women fair as the daughters of Job in all the land, and their father doth give to them an inheritance in the midst of their brethren.</verse>
