<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="5" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Turn your ear to my understanding:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">that you may maintain discretion, that your lips may preserve knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the lips of an adulteress drip honey. Her mouth is smoother than oil,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a two-edged sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Her feet go down to death. Her steps lead straight to Sheol.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">She gives no thought to the way of life. Her ways are crooked, and she doesn’t know it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Now therefore, my sons, listen to me. Don’t depart from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Remove your way far from her. Don’t come near the door of her house,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">lest you give your honor to others, and your years to the cruel one;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">lest strangers feast on your wealth, and your labors enrich another man’s house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">You will groan at your latter end, when your flesh and your body are consumed,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">and say, “How I have hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">neither have I obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor turned my ear to those who instructed me!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I have come to the brink of utter ruin, in the midst of the gathered assembly.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Drink water out of your own cistern, running water out of your own well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Should your springs overflow in the streets, streams of water in the public squares?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Let them be for yourself alone, not for strangers with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Let your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A loving doe and a graceful deer—let her breasts satisfy you at all times. Be captivated always with her love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For why should you, my son, be captivated with an adulteress? Why embrace the bosom of another?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the ways of man are before the eyes of Yahweh. He examines all his paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The evil deeds of the wicked ensnare him. The cords of his sin hold him firmly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He will die for lack of instruction. In the greatness of his folly, he will go astray.</p>
