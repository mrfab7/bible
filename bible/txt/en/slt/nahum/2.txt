1	The hammer came up upon thy face: press upon the fortress, look about the way, strengthen the loins, make the power strong greatly.
2	For Jehovah turned back the pride of Jacob as the pride of Israel: for they emptying emptied them out, they corrupted their vine-shoots.
3	The shield of the strong ones being red, the men of strength being clothed in scarlet: with fire of irons the chariots in the day of his preparing, and the cypresses were made to tremble.
4	The chariots shall be mad in the streets, they shall run up and down in the broad places: their appearance as flames; as lightnings shall they run.
5	He shall make mention of his chiefs: they shall be weak in their goings; they shall hasten to her wall, and the covering was prepared.
6	The gates of the rivers were opened, and the temple melted away.
7	It was fixed, she was led away captive, she went up and her maids being led as the voice of doves smiting upon their heart.
8	And Nineveh it is as a pool of water from the days, and they fleeing, stood: they stood, and none looking back.
9	They plundered silver, they plundered gold: and no end to her splendid equipage; glory from all the vessels of desire.
10	She was emptied, and being emptied, and being made empty: and the heart melted, and a wavering of the knees, and trembling in all loins, and the face of them all gathered a glow.
11	Where is the dwelling of the lions and that pasture for the young lions where the lion went, the lioness there, the lionâ€™s whelp, and none terrifying?
12	The lion tore in pieces the sufficiency of his whelps, and strangling for his lionesses; and his holes shall be filled with the prey, and his dens with that torn in pieces.
13	Behold me against thee, says Jehovah of armies; and I burnt her chariot in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions, and I cut of thy prey from the land, and the voice of her messengers shall no more be heard.
