<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I AM come into my garden, my sister, my bride: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I was asleep, but my heart waked: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, my locks with the drops of the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my heart was moved for him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with liquid myrrh, upon the handles of the bolt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone. My soul had failed me when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The watchmen that go about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my mantle from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so adjure us?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">His eyes are like doves beside the water brooks; washed with milk, and fitly set.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as banks of sweet herbs: his lips are as lilies, dropping liquid myrrh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">His hands are as rings of gold set with beryl: his body is as ivory work overlaid with sapphires.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his aspect is like Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.</p>
