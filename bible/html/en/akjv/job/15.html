<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches with which he can do no good?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Yes, you cast off fear, and restrain prayer before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For your mouth utters your iniquity, and you choose the tongue of the crafty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Your own mouth comdemns you, and not I: yes, your own lips testify against you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Are you the first man that was born? or were you made before the hills?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Have you heard the secret of God? and do you restrain wisdom to yourself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What know you, that we know not? what understand you, which is not in us?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">With us are both the gray headed and very aged men, much elder than your father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Are the consolations of God small with you? is there any secret thing with you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Why does your heart carry you away? and what do your eyes wink at,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">That you turn your spirit against God, and let such words go out of your mouth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold, he puts no trust in his saints; yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinks iniquity like water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I will show you, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">To whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The wicked man travails with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He believes not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He wanders abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For he stretches out his hand against God, and strengthens himself against the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He runs on him, even on his neck, on the thick bosses of his bucklers:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Because he covers his face with his fatness, and makes bulges of fat on his flanks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And he dwells in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabits, which are ready to become heaps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompense.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepares deceit.</p>
