  <verse number="1">And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, in the wilderness of Sinai, in the second year of their going out of the land of Egypt, in the first month, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">‘Also, the sons of Israel prepare the passover in its appointed season;</verse>
  <verse number="3">in the fourteenth day of this month between the evenings ye prepare it in its appointed season; according to all its statutes, and according to all its ordinances ye prepare it.’</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Moses speaketh unto the sons of Israel to prepare the passover,</verse>
  <verse number="5">and they prepare the passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, between the evenings, in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that Jehovah hath commanded Moses, so have the sons of Israel done.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And there are men who have been defiled by the body of a man, and they have not been able to prepare the passover on that day, and they come near before Moses, and before Aaron, on that day,</verse>
  <verse number="7">and those men say unto him, ‘We are defiled by the body of a man; why are we withheld so as not to bring near the offering of Jehovah in its appointed season, in the midst of the sons of Israel?’</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Moses saith unto them, ‘Stand ye, and I hear what Jehovah hath commanded concerning you.’</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="10">‘Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, Though any man is unclean by a body or in a distant journey (of you or of your generations), yet he hath prepared a passover to Jehovah;</verse>
  <verse number="11">in the second month, on the fourteenth day, between the evenings they prepare it; with unleavened and bitter things they eat it;</verse>
  <verse number="12">they do not leave of till morning; and a bone they do not break in it: according to all the statute of the passover they prepare it.</verse>
  <verse number="13">‘And the man who is clean, and hath not been on a journey, and hath ceased to prepare the passover, even that person hath been cut off from his people; because the offering of Jehovah he hath not brought near, in its appointed season, that man doth bear his sin.</verse>
  <verse number="14">‘And when a sojourner sojourneth with you, then he hath prepared a passover to Jehovah, according to the statute of the passover, and according to its ordinance, so he doth; one statute is to you, even to a sojourner, and to a native of the land.’</verse>
  <verse number="15">And in the day of the raising up of the tabernacle hath the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the tent of the testimony; and in the evening there is on the tabernacle as an appearance of fire till morning;</verse>
  <verse number="16">so it is continually; the cloud covereth it, also the appearance of fire by night.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And according to the going up of the cloud from off the tent and afterwards do the sons of Israel journey; and in the place where the cloud doth tabernacle, there do the sons of Israel encamp;</verse>
  <verse number="18">by the command of Jehovah the sons of Israel journey, and by the command of Jehovah they encamp; all the days that the cloud doth tabernacle over the tabernacle they encamp.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And in the cloud prolonging itself over the tabernacle many days, then have the sons of Israel kept the charge of Jehovah, and journey not,</verse>
  <verse number="20">and so when the cloud is a number of days over the tabernacle; by the command of Jehovah they encamp, and by the command of Jehovah they journey.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And so when the cloud is from evening till morning, when the cloud hath gone up in the morning, then they have journeyed; whether by day or by night, when the cloud hath gone up, then they have journeyed.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Whether two days, or a month, or days, in the cloud prolonging itself over the tabernacle, to tabernacle over it, the sons of Israel encamp, and journey not; and in its being lifted up they journey;</verse>
  <verse number="23">by the command of Jehovah they encamp, and by the command of Jehovah they journey; the charge of Jehovah they have kept, by the command of Jehovah in the hand of Moses.</verse>
