  <verse number="28">And this the work of the base: borders to them, and borders between the joinings:</verse>
  <verse number="29">And upon the borders which were between the joinings, lions, oxen, and cherubs: and upon the joinings thus from above: and from beneath to the lions and to the oxen, wreaths, a work of descent.</verse>

  <verse number="36">And he will open, upon the cheeks of its hands and upon its borders, cherubs, lions, and palm-trees, according to the nakedness of each, and wreaths round about.</verse>
  <verse number="37">According to this he made the ten bases, one casting, one measure, one form to all of them.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And he will make ten wash-basins of brass: the one wash-basin will hold forty baths, four by the cubit the one wash-basin, the one wash-basin upon the one base to the ten bases.</verse>
