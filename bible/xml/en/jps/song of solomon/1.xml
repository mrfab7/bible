  <verse number="1">THE song of songs, which is Solomon’s.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth—For thy love is better than wine.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thine ointments have a goodly fragrance; Thy name is as ointment poured forth; Therefore do the maidens love thee.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Draw me, we will run after thee; The king hath brought me into his chambers; We will be glad and rejoice in thee, We will find thy love more fragrant than wine! Sincerely do they love thee.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, As the tents of Kedar, As the curtains of Solomon.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Look not upon me, that I am swarthy, That the sun hath tanned me; My mother’s sons were incensed against me, They made me keeper of the vineyards; But mine own vineyard have I not kept.’</verse>
  <verse number="7">Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, Where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon; For why should I be as one that veileth herself Beside the flocks of thy companions?</verse>
  <verse number="8">If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock And feed thy kids, beside the shepherds’ tents.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I have compared thee, O my love, To a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Thy cheeks are comely with circlets, Thy neck with beads.</verse>
  <verse number="11">We will make thee circlets of gold With studs of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="12">While the king sat at his table, My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.</verse>
  <verse number="13">My beloved is unto me as a bag of myrrh, That lieth betwixt my breasts.</verse>
  <verse number="14">My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna In the vineyards of En-gedi.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; Thine eyes are as doves.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant; Also our couch is leafy.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The beams of our houses are cedars, And our panels are cypresses.</verse>
