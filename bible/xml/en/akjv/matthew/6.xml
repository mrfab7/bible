<chapter book="Matthew" number="6" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Take heed that you do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise you have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Therefore when you do your alms, do not sound a trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But when you do alms, let not your left hand know what your right hand does:</verse>
  <verse number="4">That your alms may be in secret: and your Father which sees in secret himself shall reward you openly.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But you, when you pray, enter into your closet, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father which is in secret; and your Father which sees in secret shall reward you openly.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But when you pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Be not you therefore like to them: for your Father knows what things you have need of, before you ask him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">After this manner therefore pray you: Our Father which are in heaven, Hallowed be your name.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Your kingdom come, Your will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Give us this day our daily bread.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For your is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:</verse>
  <verse number="15">But if you forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Moreover when you fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men to fast. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;</verse>
  <verse number="18">That you appear not to men to fast, but to your Father which is in secret: and your Father, which sees in secret, shall reward you openly.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust does corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:</verse>
  <verse number="20">But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust does corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:</verse>
  <verse number="21">For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The light of the body is the eye: if therefore your eye be single, your whole body shall be full of light.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But if your eye be evil, your whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you be darkness, how great is that darkness!</verse>
  <verse number="24">No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor yet for your body, what you shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?</verse>
  <verse number="26">Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much better than they?</verse>
  <verse number="27">Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature?</verse>
  <verse number="28">And why take you thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:</verse>
  <verse number="29">And yet I say to you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Why, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?</verse>
  <verse number="31">Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?</verse>
  <verse number="32">(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things.</verse>
  <verse number="33">But seek you first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added to you.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof.</verse>
