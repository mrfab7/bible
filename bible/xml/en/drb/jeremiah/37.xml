  <verse number="1">Now king Sedecias the son of Josias reigned instead of Jechonias the son of Joakim: whom Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon made king in the land of Juda.</verse>
  <verse number="2">But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land did obey the words of the Lord, that he spoke in the hand of Jeremias the prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And king Sedecias sent Juchal the son of Selemias, and Sophonias the son of Maasias the priest to Jeremias the prophet, saying: Pray to the Lord our God for us.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Now Jeremias walked freely in the midst of the people, for they had not as yet cast him into prison.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the army of Pharao was come out of Egypt: and the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem, hearing these tidings, departed from Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias the prophet, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: Thus shall you say to the king of Juda, who sent you to inquire of me: Behold the army of Pharao, which is come forth to help you, shall return into their own land, into Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Thus saith the Lord: Deceive not your souls, saying: The Chaldeans shall surely depart and go away from us: for they shall not go away;</verse>
  <verse number="10">But if you should even beat al: the army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there should be left of them some wounded men: they shall rise up, every man from his tent, and burn this city with Are.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Now when the army of the Chaldeans was gone away from Jerusalem, because of Pharao’s army,</verse>
  <verse number="12">Jeremias went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin: and to divide a possession there in the presence of the citizens.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And when he was come to the gate of Benjamin, the captain of the gate, who I was there in his turn, was one named Jerias, the son of Selemias, the son of Hananias: and he took hold of Jeremias the prophet, saying: Thou art fleeing to the Chaldeans.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Jeremias answered: It is not so, I am not fleeing to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Jerias took Jeremias and brought him to the princes.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Wherefore the princes were angry with Jeremias, and they beat him, and cast him into the prison that was in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for he was chief over the prison.</verse>
  <verse number="16">So Jeremias went into the house of the prison, and into the dungeon: and Jeremias remained there many days.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Then Sedecias the king, sending, took him: and asked him secretly in his house, and said: Is there, thinkest thou, any word from the Lord? And Jeremias said: There is. And he said: Thou shalt be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Jeremias said to king Sedecias: In what have I offended against thee, or thy servants, or thy people, that thou hast cast me into prison?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Where are your prophets that prophesied to you, and said: The king of Babylon shall not come against you, and against this land?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Now therefore hear, I beseech thee, my lord the king: let my petition be accepted in thy sight: and send me not back into the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then king Sedecias commanded that Jeremias should be committed into the entry of the prison: and that they should give him daily a piece of bread, beside broth, till all the bread in the city were spent: and Jeremias remained in the entry of the prison.</verse>
