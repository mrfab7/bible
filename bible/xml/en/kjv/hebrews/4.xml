  <verse number="1">Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left [us] of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard [it].</verse>
  <verse number="3">For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For he spake in a certain place of the seventh [day] on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And in this [place] again, If they shall enter into my rest.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</verse>
  <verse number="7">Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</verse>
  <verse number="9">There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God [did] from his.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For the word of God [is] quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and [is] a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things [are] naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast [our] profession.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as [we are, yet] without sin.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</verse>
