  <verse number="1">And Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind,</verse>
  <verse number="3">Reasoning with unprofitable talk, and with speeches which do no good?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Yea, thou makest piety of none effect, and restrainest meditation before God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou hast chosen the tongue of the crafty.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I; and thy lips testify against thee.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Art thou the first man that was born? and wast thou brought forth before the hills?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Hast thou listened in the secret council of +God? And hast thou absorbed wisdom for thyself?</verse>
  <verse number="9">What knowest thou that we know not? [what] understandest thou which is not in us?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Both the greyheaded and the aged are with us, older than thy father.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Are the consolations of God too small for thee? and the word gently spoken to thee?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Why doth thy heart carry thee away? and why do thine eyes wink?</verse>
  <verse number="13">That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest words go out of thy mouth?</verse>
  <verse number="14">What is man, that he should be pure? and he that is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Behold, he putteth no trust in his holy ones, and the heavens are not pure in his sight:</verse>
  <verse number="16">How much less the abominable and corrupt,—man, that drinketh unrighteousness like water!</verse>
  <verse number="17">I will shew thee, listen to me; and what I have seen I will declare;</verse>
  <verse number="18">Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hidden;</verse>
  <verse number="19">Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">All his days the wicked man is tormented, and numbered years are allotted to the violent.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The sound of terrors is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer cometh upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is singled out for the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He wandereth abroad for bread,—where may it be? He knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Distress and anguish make him afraid; they prevail against him, as a king ready for the battle.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For he hath stretched out his hand against God, and strengthened himself against the Almighty:</verse>
  <verse number="26">He runneth against him, with [outstretched] neck, with the thick bosses of his bucklers;</verse>
  <verse number="27">For he hath covered his face with his fatness, and gathered fat upon [his] flanks.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And he dwelleth in desolate cities, in houses that no man inhabiteth, which are destined to become heaps.</verse>
  <verse number="29">He shall not become rich, neither shall his substance continue, and their possessions shall not extend upon the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="30">He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches; and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Let him not trust in vanity: he is deceived, for vanity shall be his recompense;</verse>
  <verse number="32">It shall be complete before his day, and his branch shall not be green.</verse>
  <verse number="33">He shall shake off his unripe grapes as a vine, and shall cast his flower as an olive.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For the family of the ungodly shall be barren, and fire shall consume the tents of bribery.</verse>
  <verse number="35">They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity, and their belly prepareth deceit.</verse>
