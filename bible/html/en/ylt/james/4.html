<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Whence are wars and fightings among you? not thence—out of your passions, that are as soldiers in your members?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">ye desire, and ye have not; ye murder, and are zealous, and are not able to attain; ye fight and war, and ye have not, because of your not asking;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">ye ask, and ye receive not, because evilly ye ask, that in your pleasures ye may spend it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Adulterers and adulteresses! have ye not known that friendship of the world is enmity with God? whoever, then, may counsel to be a friend of the world, an enemy of God he is set.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Do ye think that emptily the Writing saith, ‘To envy earnestly desireth the spirit that did dwell in us,’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and greater grace he doth give, wherefore he saith, ‘God against proud ones doth set Himself up, and to lowly ones He doth give grace?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">be subject, then, to God; stand up against the devil, and he will flee from you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">draw nigh to God, and He will draw nigh to you; cleanse hands, ye sinners! and purify hearts, ye two-souled!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">be exceeding afflicted, and mourn, and weep, let your laughter to mourning be turned, and the joy to heaviness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">be made low before the Lord, and He shall exalt you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Speak not one against another, brethren; he who is speaking against a brother, and is judging his brother, doth speak against law, and doth judge law, and if law thou dost judge, thou art not a doer of law but a judge;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">one is the lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy; thou—who art thou that dost judge the other?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Go, now, ye who are saying, ‘To-day and to-morrow we will go on to such a city, and will pass there one year, and traffic, and make gain;’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">who do not know the thing of the morrow; for what is your life? for it is a vapour that is appearing for a little, and then is vanishing;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">instead of your saying, ‘If the Lord may will, we shall live, and do this or that;’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">and now ye glory in your pride; all such glorying is evil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">to him, then, knowing to do good, and not doing, sin it is to him.</p>
