1	The trumpet to thy mouth: as an eagle upon the house of Jehovah, because they passed by my covenant and they transgressed against my laws.
2	Israel shall cry to me, My God, we knew thee.
3	Israel rejected the good: the enemy shall pursue him.
4	They made kings, and not from me: and they made princes, and I knew not: their silver and their gold they made to them images to cut off.
5	Thy calf rejected, O Shomeron; mine anger was kindled against them: how long shall they not be able to be clean?
6	For from Israel, and this workman made it, and it is not God: for the calf of Shomeron shall be broken in pieces.
7	For they shall sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: no stalk to it: the sprout shall not make flour: perhaps it will make, strangers will swallow it down.
8	Israel was swallowed down: now they were among the nations as a vessel no delight in it.
9	For they went up to Assur, Ephraim a wild ass alone to himself: they hired those loving.
10	Also if they will hire among the nations, now will I gather them, and shall they be weak a little from the lifting up of the king of the princes.
11	Because Ephraim multiplied altars to sin, altars were to him to sin.
12	I will write to him his multitude of my instructions; they were reckoned as a strange thing.
13	The sacrifices of my gifts they will sacrifice flesh, and they will eat; Jehovah delighted not in them; now will he remember their iniquity, and he will review their sins: they shall turn back to Egypt.
14	And Israel will forget him making him, and he will build temples; and Judah multiplied fortified cities: and I sent a fire upon his cities and it will consume its palaces.
