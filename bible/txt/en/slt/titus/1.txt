1	Paul, servant of God, and sent of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the chosen of God, and the acknowledgment of the truth according to devotion;
2	In hope of eternal life, (which God, not false, promised before eternal times;
3	And manifested his word in his own times, in the proclamation, which I was entrusted with according to the command of the Saviour our God;)
4	To Titus, genuine child according to the common faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
5	For this I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldest rectify things left behind, and set elders in the city, as I directed thee:
6	If any be irreproachable, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not in accusation of licentiousness, or disorderly.
7	For a bishop must be irreproachable, as steward of God; not self-sufficient, not prone to anger, not intemperate, not a striker, not occupied in sordid gain.
8	But hospitable, a lover of good, of sound mind, just, holy, holding firm;
9	Holding firmly the faithful word according to instruction, that he may be able also to beseech in sound doctrine, and to refute those opposing.
10	For many also are disorderly, vain talkers and infatuates, especially they of the circumcision:
11	Who must be restrained, who subvert whole houses, teaching what they ought not, for the sake of sordid gain.
12	A certain of them said, their own prophet, The Cretians always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies.
13	This testimony is true. For this cause reprove them severely, that they may be sound in the faith;
14	Not holding to Jewish fictions, and commands of men, having turned away from the truth.
15	All things truly pure to the pure: and to the defiled and unbelieving nothing pure; but also their mind and consciousness are defiled.
16	They confess to know God; and in works they deny, being abominable, and disobedient, and to every good work not tried.
