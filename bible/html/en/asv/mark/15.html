<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And straightway in the morning the chief priests with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering saith unto him, Thou sayest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the chief priests accused him of many things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Pilate again asked him, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse thee of.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But Jesus no more answered anything; insomuch that Pilate marvelled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Now at the feast he used to release unto them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And there was one called Barabbas, lying bound with them that had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the multitude went up and began to ask him to do as he was wont to do unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Pilate again answered and said unto them, What then shall I do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And they cried out again, Crucify him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out exceedingly, Crucify him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released unto them Barabbas, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Prætorium; and they call together the whole band.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it on him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And they smote his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And when they had mocked him, they took off from him the purple, and put on him his garments. And they lead him out to crucify him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And they compel one passing by, Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And they crucify him, and part his garments among them, casting lots upon them, what each should take.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And with him they crucify two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28"></p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ha! thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">save thyself, and come down from the cross.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">In like manner also the chief priests mocking him among themselves with the scribes said, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reproached him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elijah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And one ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let be; let us see whether Elijah cometh to take him down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And Jesus uttered a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And when the centurion, who stood by over against him, saw that he so gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And there were also women beholding from afar: among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him; and many other women that came up with him unto Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And when even was now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">there came Joseph of Arimathæa, a councillor of honorable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God; and he boldly went in unto Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">And when he learned it of the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">And he bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of a rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.</p>
