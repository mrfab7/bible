<chapter book="1 Peter" number="4" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Christ, then, having suffered for us in [the] flesh, do ye also arm yourselves with the same mind; for he that has suffered in [the] flesh has done with sin,</verse>
  <verse number="2">no longer to live the rest of [his] time in [the] flesh to men’s lusts, but to God’s will.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the time past [is] sufficient [for us] to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, walking in lasciviousness, lusts, wine-drinking, revels, drinkings, and unhallowed idolatries.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with [them] to the same sink of corruption, speaking injuriously [of you];</verse>
  <verse number="5">who shall render account to him who is ready to judge [the] living and [the] dead.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For to this [end] were the glad tidings preached to [the] dead also, that they might be judged, as regards men, after [the] flesh, but live, as regards God, after [the] Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But the end of all things is drawn nigh: be sober therefore, and be watchful unto prayers;</verse>
  <verse number="8">but before all things having fervent love among yourselves, because love covers a multitude of sins;</verse>
  <verse number="9">hospitable one to another, without murmuring;</verse>
  <verse number="10">each according as he has received a gift, ministering it to one another, as good stewards of [the] various grace of God.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If any one speak—as oracles of God; if any one minister—as of strength which God supplies; that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the might for the ages of ages. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Beloved, take not [as] strange the fire [of persecution] which has taken place amongst you for [your] trial, as if a strange thing was happening to you;</verse>
  <verse number="13">but as ye have share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, that in the revelation of his glory also ye may rejoice with exultation.</verse>
  <verse number="14">If ye are reproached in [the] name of Christ, blessed [are ye]; for the [Spirit] of glory and the Spirit of God rests upon you: [on their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified.]</verse>
  <verse number="15">Let none of you suffer indeed as murderer, or thief, or evildoer, or as overseer of other people’s matters;</verse>
  <verse number="16">but if as a christian, let him not be ashamed, but glorify God in this name.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For the time of having the judgment begin from the house of God [is come]; but if first from us, what [shall be] the end of those who obey not the glad tidings of God?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And if the righteous is difficultly saved, where shall the impious and [the] sinner appear?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Wherefore also let them who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator.</verse>
