<chapter book="Ezekiel" number="17" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Son of man, put forth a riddle, and speak a parable unto the house of Israel;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD: A great eagle with great wings and long pinions, full of feathers, which had divers colours, came unto Lebanon, and took the top of the cedar:</verse>
  <verse number="4">he cropped off the topmost of the young twigs thereof, and carried it into a land of traffic; he set it in a city of merchants.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He took also of the seed of the land, and planted it in a fruitful soil; he placed it beside many waters; he set it as a willow tree.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And it grew, and became a spreading vine of low stature, whose branches turned toward him, and the roots thereof were under him: so it became a vine, and brought forth branches, and shot forth sprigs.</verse>
  <verse number="7">There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers: and, behold, this vine did bend its roots toward him, and shot forth its branches toward him, from the beds of its plantation, that he might water it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">It was planted in a good soil by many waters, that it might bring forth branches, and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Shall it prosper? shall he not pull up the roots thereof, and cut off the fruit thereof, that it may wither; that all its fresh springing leaves may wither; even without great power or much people to pluck it up by the roots thereof?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Yea, behold, being planted, shall it prosper? shall it not utterly wither; when the east wind toucheth it? it shall wither in the beds where it grew.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="12">Say now to the rebellious house, Know ye not what these things mean? tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, and took the king thereof, and the princes thereof, and brought them to him to Babylon;</verse>
  <verse number="13">and he took of the seed royal, and made a covenant with him; he also brought him under an oath, and took away the mighty of the land:</verse>
  <verse number="14">that the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors into Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he prosper? shall he escape that doeth such things? shall he break the covenant, and yet escape?</verse>
  <verse number="16">As I live, saith the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he brake, even with him in the midst of Babylon he shall die.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Neither shall Pharaoh with his mighty army and great company make for him in the war, when they cast up mounts and build forts, to cut off many persons.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For he hath despised the oath by breaking the covenant; and behold, he had given his hand, and yet hath done all these things; he shall not escape.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD: As I live, surely mine oath that he hath despised, and my covenant that he hath broken, I will even bring it upon his own head.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon, and will plead with him there for his trespass that he hath trespassed against me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And all his fugitives in all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward every wind: and ye shall know that I the LORD have spoken it.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Thus saith the Lord GOD: I will also take of the lofty top of the cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the topmost of his young twigs a tender one, and I will plant it upon an high mountain and eminent:</verse>
  <verse number="23">in the mountain of the height of Israel will I plant it: and it shall bring forth boughs, and bear fruit, and be a goodly cedar: and under it shall dwell all fowl of every wing; in the shadow of the branches thereof shall they dwell.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And all the trees of the field shall know that I the LORD have brought down the high tree, have exalted the low tree, have dried up the green tree, and have made the dry tree to flourish: I the LORD have spoken and have done it.</verse>
