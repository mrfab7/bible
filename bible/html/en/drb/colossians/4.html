<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Masters, do to your servants that which is just and equal: knowing that you also have a master in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Be instant in prayer; watching in it with thanksgiving:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Praying withal for us also, that God may open unto us a door of speech to speak the mystery of Christ (for which also I am bound;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">That I may make it manifest as I ought to speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Walk with wisdom towards them that are without, redeeming the time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Let your speech be always in grace seasoned with salt: that you may know how you ought to answer every man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All the things that concern me, Tychicus, our dearest brother, and faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord, will make known to you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Whom I have sent to you for this same purpose, that he may know the things that concern you, and comfort your hearts,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">With Onesimus, a most beloved and faithful brother, who is one of you. All things that are done here, they shall make known to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, saluteth you, and Mark, the cousin german of Barnabus, touching whom you have received commandments; if he come unto you, receive him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Jesus, that is called Justus: who are of the circumcision: these only are my helpers in the kingdom of God; who have been a comfort to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Epaphras saluteth you, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, who is always solicitous for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect, and full in all the will of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For I bear him testimony that he hath much labour for you, and for them that are at Laodicea, and them at Hierapolis.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Luke, the most dear physician, saluteth you: and Demas.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Salute the brethren who are at Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church that is in his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And when this epistle shall have been read with you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans: and that you read that which is of the Laodiceans.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And say to Archippus: Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The salutation of Paul with my own hand. Be mindful of my bands. Grace be with you. Amen</p>
