<chapter book="Jonah" number="4" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he prayed to the LORD, and said, I pray you, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before to Tarshish: for I knew that you are a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repent you of the evil.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech you, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then said the LORD, Do you well to be angry?</verse>
  <verse number="5">So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat on the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And God said to Jonah, Do you well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even to death.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then said the LORD, You have had pity on the gourd, for the which you have not labored, neither made it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:</verse>
  <verse number="11">And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more then six score thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle?</verse>
