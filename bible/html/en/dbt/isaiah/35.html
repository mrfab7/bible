<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The wilderness and the dry land shall be gladdened; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">It shall blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and shouting: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon. They shall see the glory of Jehovah, the excellency of our God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Strengthen the weak hands and confirm the tottering knees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Say to them that are of a timid heart, Be strong, fear not; behold your God: vengeance cometh, the recompense of God! He will come himself, and save you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf be unstopped;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">then shall the lame [man] leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and torrents in the desert.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the mirage shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of wild dogs, where they lay down, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And a highway shall be there and a way, and it shall be called, The way of holiness: the unclean shall not pass through it; but it shall be for these. Those that go [this] way—even fools,—shall not err [therein].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">No lion shall be there, nor shall ravenous beast go up thereon, nor be found there; but the redeemed shall walk [there].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the ransomed of Jehovah shall return, and come to Zion with singing; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain gladness and joy, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.</p>
