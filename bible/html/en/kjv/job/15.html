<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">[Art] thou the first man [that] was born? or wast thou made before the hills?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What knowest thou, that we know not? [what] understandest thou, which [is] not in us?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">With us [are] both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">[Are] the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest [such] words go out of thy mouth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What [is] man, that he should be clean? and [he which is] born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">How much more abominable and filthy [is] man, which drinketh iniquity like water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I will shew thee, hear me; and that [which] I have seen I will declare;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid [it]:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The wicked man travaileth with pain all [his] days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">A dreadful sound [is] in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He wandereth abroad for bread, [saying], Where [is it]? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He runneth upon him, [even] on [his] neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on [his] flanks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And he dwelleth in desolate cities, [and] in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For the congregation of hypocrites [shall be] desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.</p>
