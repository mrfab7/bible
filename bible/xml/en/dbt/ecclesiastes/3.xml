<chapter book="Ecclesiastes" number="3" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heavens:</verse>
  <verse number="2">A time to be born, and a time to die; A time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</verse>
  <verse number="3">A time to kill, and a time to heal; A time to break down, and a time to build up;</verse>
  <verse number="4">A time to weep, and a time to laugh; A time to mourn, and a time to dance;</verse>
  <verse number="5">A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</verse>
  <verse number="6">A time to seek, and a time to lose; A time to keep, and a time to cast away;</verse>
  <verse number="7">A time to rend, and a time to sew; A time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</verse>
  <verse number="8">A time to love, and a time to hate; A time of war, and a time of peace.</verse>
  <verse number="9">What profit hath he that worketh from that wherein he laboureth?</verse>
  <verse number="10">I have seen the travail that God hath given to the sons of men to toil in.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He hath made everything beautiful in its time; also he hath set the world in their heart, so that man findeth not out from the beginning to the end the work that God doeth.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I know that there is nothing good for them but to rejoice and to do well in their life;</verse>
  <verse number="13">yea also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy good in all his labour, it is the gift of God.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I know that whatever God doeth, it shall be for ever; there is nothing to be added to it, nor anything to be taken from it; and God doeth [it], that [men] should fear before him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">That which is was long ago, and that which is to be hath already been; and God bringeth back again that which is past.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And moreover I saw under the sun, that in the place of judgment, wickedness was there; and in the place of righteousness, wickedness was there.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I said in my heart, God will judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I said in my heart, It is thus with the children of men, that God may prove them, and that they should see that they themselves are but beasts.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For what befalleth the children of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other, and they have all one breath; and man hath no pre-eminence above the beast: for all is vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="20">All go unto one place: all are of the dust, and all return to dust.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Who knoweth the spirit of the children of men? Doth it go upwards? and the spirit of the beasts, doth it go downwards to the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="22">And I have seen that there is nothing better than that man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion; for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</verse>
