<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover Eliu spoke these words :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Doth thy thought seem right to thee, that thou shouldst say : I am more just than God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For thou saidst : That which is right doth not please thee : or what will it profit thee if I sin?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Therefore I will answer thy words, and thy friends with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Look up to heaven and see, and behold the sky, that it is higher than thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If thou sin, what shalt thou hurt him? and if thy iniquities be multiplied, what shalt thou do against him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And if thou do justly, what shalt thou give him, or what shall he receive of thy hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Thy wickedness may hurt a man that is like thee : and thy justice may help the son of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they shall cry out : and shall wail for the violence of the arm of tyrants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he hath not said : Where is God, who made me, who hath given songs in the night?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and instructeth us more than the fowls of the air.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">There shall they cry, and he will not hear, because of the pride of evil men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">God therefore will not hear in vain, and the Almighty will look into the causes of every one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Yea when thou shalt say : He considereth not : be judged before him, and expect him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For he doth not now bring on his fury, neither doth he revenge wickedness exceedingly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Therefore Job openeth his mouth in vain, and multiplieth words without knowledge.</p>
