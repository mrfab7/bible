<chapter book="Proverbs" number="5" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My son, pay attention to my wisdom; incline your ear to my insight,</verse>
  <verse number="2">that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Though the lips of the forbidden woman drip honey and her speech is smoother than oil,</verse>
  <verse number="4">in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a double-edged sword.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to Sheol.</verse>
  <verse number="6">She does not consider the path of life; she does not know that her ways are unstable.</verse>
  <verse number="7">So now, my sons, listen to me, and do not turn aside from the words of my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Keep your path far from her; do not go near the door of her house,</verse>
  <verse number="9">lest you concede your vigor to others, and your years to one who is cruel;</verse>
  <verse number="10">lest strangers feast on your wealth, and your labors enrich the house of a foreigner.</verse>
  <verse number="11">At the end of your life you will groan when your flesh and your body are spent,</verse>
  <verse number="12">and you will say, “How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof!</verse>
  <verse number="13">I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my mentors.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I am on the brink of utter ruin in the midst of the whole assembly.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">Drink water from your own cistern, and running water from your own well.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Why should your springs flow in the streets, your streams of water in the public squares?</verse>
  <verse number="17">Let them be yours alone, never to be shared with strangers.</verse>
  <verse number="18">May your fountain be blessed, and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth:</verse>
  <verse number="19">A loving doe, a graceful fawn—may her breasts satisfy you always; may you be captivated by her love forever.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Why be captivated, my son, by an adulteress, or embrace the bosom of a stranger?</verse>
  <verse number="21">For a man’s ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and the LORD examines all his paths.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The iniquities of a wicked man entrap him; the cords of his sin entangle him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He dies for lack of discipline, led astray by his own great folly.</verse>
