<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and masons, and carpenters, to build him a house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">David perceived that Yahweh had established him king over Israel; for his kingdom was exalted on high, for his people Israel’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">David took more wives at Jerusalem; and David became the father of more sons and daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">These are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpelet,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphelet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David: and David heard of it, and went out against them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">David inquired of God, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will you deliver them into my hand?” Yahweh said to him, “Go up; for I will deliver them into your hand.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">So they came up to Baal Perazim, and David struck them there; and David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand, like the breach of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal Perazim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They left their gods there; and David gave commandment, and they were burned with fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The Philistines yet again made a raid in the valley.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">David inquired again of God; and God said to him, “You shall not go up after them. Turn away from them, and come on them over against the mulberry trees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">It shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then you shall go out to battle; for God has gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">David did as God commanded him: and they struck the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The fame of David went out into all lands; and Yahweh brought the fear of him on all nations.</p>
