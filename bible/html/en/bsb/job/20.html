<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“So my anxious thoughts compel me to answer, because of the turmoil within me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I have heard a rebuke that insults me, and my understanding prompts a reply.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Do you not know that from antiquity, since man was placed on the earth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">the triumph of the wicked has been brief and the joy of the godless momentary?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Though his arrogance reaches the heavens, and his head touches the clouds,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">he will perish forever, like his own dung; those who had seen him will ask, ‘Where is he?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He will fly away like a dream, never to be found; he will be chased away like a vision in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The eye that saw him will see him no more, and his place will no longer behold him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">His sons will seek the favor of the poor, for his own hands must return his wealth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie down with him in the dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Though evil is sweet in his mouth and he conceals it under his tongue,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">though he cannot bear to let it go and keeps it in his mouth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">yet in his stomach his food sours into the venom of cobras within him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He swallows wealth but vomits it out; God will force it from his stomach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He will suck the poison of cobras; the fangs of a viper will kill him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He will not enjoy the streams, the rivers flowing with honey and cream.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He must return the fruit of his labor without consuming it; he cannot enjoy the profits of his trading.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor; he has seized houses he did not build.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Because his appetite is never satisfied, he cannot escape with his treasure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Nothing is left for him to consume; thus his prosperity will not endure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">In the midst of his plenty, he will be distressed; the full force of misery will come upon him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">When he has filled his stomach, God will vent His fury upon him, raining it down on him as he eats.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Though he flees from an iron weapon, a bronze-tipped arrow will pierce him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">It is drawn out of his back, the gleaming point from his liver. Terrors come over him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Total darkness is reserved for his treasures. A fire unfanned will consume him and devour what is left in his tent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The heavens will expose his iniquity, and the earth will rise up against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The possessions of his house will be removed, flowing away on the day of God’s wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">This is the wicked man’s portion from God, the inheritance God has appointed him.”</p>
