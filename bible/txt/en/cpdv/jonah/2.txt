1	And Jonah prayed to the Lord, his God, from the belly of the fish.
2	And he said: “I cried out to the Lord from my tribulation, and he heeded me. From the belly of hell, I cried out, and you heeded my voice.
3	And you have thrown me into the deep, in the heart of the sea, and a flood has encircled me. All your whirlpools and your waves have passed over me.
4	And I said: I am expelled from the sight of your eyes. Yet, truly, I will see your holy temple again.
5	The waters surrounded me, even to the soul. The abyss has walled me in. The ocean has covered my head.
6	I descended to the base of the mountains. The bars of the earth have enclosed me forever. And you will raise up my life from corruption, Lord, my God.
7	When my soul was in anguish within me, I called to mind the Lord, so that my prayer might come to you, to your holy temple.
8	Those who in vain observe vanities, abandon their own mercy.
9	But I, with a voice of praise, will sacrifice to you. I will repay whatever I have vowed to the Lord, because of my salvation.”
10	And the Lord spoke to the fish, and it vomited Jonah onto dry land.
