<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And I turned back, and I shall see all the oppressions which are doing under the sun: and behold, the tears of the oppressed, and none comforting to them; and from the hand of those oppressing them was power, and none comforting to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And I praise the dead already dead more than the living they yet living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And good above them two which were not yet, which saw not the evil work which was done under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I saw all the labor and all the success of the work, for this the jealousy of a man from his neighbor. Also this is vanity and striving of spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The foolish one folded his hands together, and ate his flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Good a hand filled with rest, above two hands full of labor and striving of spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I turned back, and I shall see vanity under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">There is one, and not a second; also a son and brother not to him: and no end to all his labor; also his eye shall not be satisfied with riches: and for whom do I labor and diminish my soul from good? Also this is vanity, and it is an evil labor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Two are good above one, because there is to them a good reward in their labor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For if they shall fall, the one will raise up his companion: and wo to him, the one that shall fall, and not a second to raise him up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Also if two shall lie down, and heat to them: and to the one it shall not be warm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And if one shall become strong against him, two shall stand before him; and a three-fold thread shall not be quickly broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Good a poor and wise child above an old and foolish king, who knew not more to receive instruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For from the house of those turning away he came forth to reign; for also he being born in his kingdom became poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I saw all the living going under the sun, with the second child which shall stand in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">No end to all the people, to all which were before them: also the last ones shall not rejoice in him. For also this is vanity and striving of the spirit.</p>
