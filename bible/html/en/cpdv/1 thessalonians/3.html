<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Because of this, willing to wait no longer, it was pleasing to us to remain at Athens, alone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And we sent Timothy, our brother and a minister of God in the Gospel of Christ, to confirm you and to exhort you, on behalf of your faith,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">so that no one would be disturbed during these tribulations. For you yourselves know that we have been appointed to this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For even while we were with you, we predicted to you that we would suffer tribulations, even as it has happened, and as you know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For this reason also, I was not willing to wait any longer, and I sent to find out about your faith, lest perhaps he who tempts may have tempted you, and our labor might have been in vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But then, when Timothy arrived to us from you, he reported to us your faith and charity, and that you keep a good remembrance of us always, desiring to see us, just as we likewise desire to see you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">As a result, we were consoled in you, brothers, in the midst of all our difficulties and tribulations, through your faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For we now live so that you may stand firm in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For what thanks would we be able to repay to God because of you, for all the joy with which we rejoice over you before our God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For night and day, ever more abundantly, we are praying that we may see your face, and that we may complete those things that are lacking in your faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But may God our Father himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And may the Lord multiply you, and make you abound in your charity toward one another and toward all, just as we also do toward you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">in order to confirm your hearts without blame, in sanctity, before God our Father, unto the return of our Lord Jesus Christ, with all his saints. Amen.</p>
