  <verse number="1">But we ought, we that are strong, to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Let each one of us please his neighbour with a view to what is good, to edification.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the Christ also did not please himself; but according as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproach thee have fallen upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For as many things as have been written before have been written for our instruction, that through endurance and through encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now the God of endurance and of encouragement give to you to be like-minded one toward another, according to Christ Jesus;</verse>
  <verse number="6">that ye may with one accord, with one mouth, glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Wherefore receive ye one another, according as the Christ also has received you to [the] glory of God.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For I say that Jesus Christ became a minister of [the] circumcision for [the] truth of God, to confirm the promises of the fathers;</verse>
  <verse number="9">and that the nations should glorify God for mercy; according as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among [the] nations, and will sing to thy name.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And again he says, Rejoice, nations, with his people.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And again, Praise the Lord, all [ye] nations, and let all the peoples laud him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And again, Esaias says, There shall be the root of Jesse, and one that arises, to rule over [the] nations: in him shall [the] nations hope.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that ye should abound in hope by [the] power of [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But I am persuaded, my brethren, I myself also, concerning you, that yourselves also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But I have written to you the more boldly, [brethren,] in part, as putting you in mind, because of the grace given to me by God,</verse>
  <verse number="16">for me to be minister of Christ Jesus to the nations, carrying on as a sacrificial service the [message of] glad tidings of God, in order that the offering up of the nations might be acceptable, sanctified by [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I have therefore [whereof to] boast in Christ Jesus in the things which pertain to God.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For I will not dare to speak anything of the things which Christ has not wrought by me, for [the] obedience of [the] nations, by word and deed,</verse>
  <verse number="19">in [the] power of signs and wonders, in [the] power of [the] Spirit of God; so that I, from Jerusalem, and in a circuit round to Illyricum, have fully preached the glad tidings of the Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="20">and so aiming to announce the glad tidings, not where Christ has been named, that I might not build upon another’s foundation;</verse>
  <verse number="21">but according as it is written, To whom there was nothing told concerning him, they shall see; and they that have not heard shall understand.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Wherefore also I have been often hindered from coming to you.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But now, having no longer place in these regions, and having great desire to come to you these many years,</verse>
  <verse number="24">whenever I should go to Spain; (for I hope to see you as I go through, and by you to be set forward thither, if first I shall have been in part filled with your company;)</verse>
  <verse number="25">but now I go to Jerusalem, ministering to the saints;</verse>
  <verse number="26">for Macedonia and Achaia have been well pleased to make a certain contribution for the poor of the saints who [are] in Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="27">They have been well pleased indeed, and they are their debtors; for if the nations have participated in their spiritual things, they ought also in fleshly to minister to them.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Having finished this therefore, and having sealed to them this fruit, I will set off by you into Spain.</verse>
  <verse number="29">But I know that, coming to you, I shall come in [the] fulness of [the] blessing of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="30">But I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in prayers for me to God;</verse>
  <verse number="31">that I may be saved from those that do not believe in Judaea; and that my ministry which [I have] for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;</verse>
  <verse number="32">in order that I may come to you in joy by God’s will, and that I may be refreshed with you.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</verse>
