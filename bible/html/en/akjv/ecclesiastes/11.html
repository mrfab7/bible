<div class="chapter" data-book="Ecclesiastes" data-chapter="11" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Cast your bread on the waters: for you shall find it after many days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for you know not what evil shall be on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves on the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it shall be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He that observes the wind shall not sow; and he that regards the clouds shall not reap.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">As you know not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so you know not the works of God who makes all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In the morning sow your seed, and in the evening withhold not your hand: for you know not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that comes is vanity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Rejoice, O young man, in your youth; and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes: but know you, that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore remove sorrow from your heart, and put away evil from your flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.</p>
