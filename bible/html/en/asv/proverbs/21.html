<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The kingâ€™s heart is in the hand of Jehovah as the watercourses: He turneth it whithersoever he will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Every way of a man is right in his own eyes; But Jehovah weighteth the hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">To do righteousness and justice Is more acceptable to Jehovah than sacrifice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A high look, and a proud heart, Even the lamp of the wicked, is sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; But every one that is hasty hasteth only to want.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The getting of treasures by a lying tongue Is a vapor driven to and fro by them that seek death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The violence of the wicked shall sweep them away, Because they refuse to do justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The way of him that is laden with guilt is exceeding crooked; But as for the pure, his work is right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, Than with a contentious woman in a wide house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The soul of the wicked desireth evil: His neighbor findeth no favor in his eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">When the scoffer is punished, the simple is made wise; And when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The righteous man considereth the house of the wicked, How the wicked are overthrown to their ruin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, He also shall cry, but shall not be heard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">A gift in secret pacifieth anger; And a present in the bosom, strong wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">It is joy to the righteous to do justice; But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding Shall rest in the assembly of the dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: He that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The wicked is a ransom for the righteous; And the treacherous cometh in the stead of the upright.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">It is better to dwell in a desert land, Than with a contentious and fretful woman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">There is precious treasure and oil in the dwelling of the wise; But a foolish man swalloweth it up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He that followeth after righteousness and kindness Findeth life, righteousness, and honor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, And bringeth down the strength of the confidence thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue Keepeth his soul from troubles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The proud and haughty man, scoffer is his name; He worketh in the arrogance of pride.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The desire of the sluggard killeth him; For his hands refuse to labor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">There is that coveteth greedily all the day long; But the righteous giveth and withholdeth not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination: How much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A false witness shall perish; But the man that heareth shall speak so as to endure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">A wicked man hardeneth his face; But as for the upright, he establisheth his ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">There is no wisdom nor understanding Nor counsel against Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The horse is prepared against the day of battle; But victory is of Jehovah.</p>
