<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Should a wise man answer with vain knowledge, and fill himself with the east wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Should he reason with unprofitable talk, or with speeches with which he can do no good?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Yes, you do away with fear, and hinder devotion before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the language of the crafty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Your own mouth condemns you, and not I. Yes, your own lips testify against you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">“Are you the first man who was born? Or were you brought forth before the hills?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Have you heard the secret counsel of God? Do you limit wisdom to yourself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What do you know, that we don’t know? What do you understand, which is not in us?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">With us are both the gray-headed and the very aged men, much elder than your father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Are the consolations of God too small for you, even the word that is gentle toward you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Why does your heart carry you away? Why do your eyes flash,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">That you turn your spirit against God, and let such words go out of your mouth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What is man, that he should be clean? What is he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold, he puts no trust in his holy ones. Yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks iniquity like water!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">“I will show you, listen to me; that which I have seen I will declare:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">(Which wise men have told by their fathers, and have not hidden it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">to whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them):</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">the wicked man writhes in pain all his days, even the number of years that are laid up for the oppressor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">A sound of terrors is in his ears. In prosperity the destroyer shall come on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He doesn’t believe that he shall return out of darkness. He is waited for by the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He wanders abroad for bread, saying, ‘Where is it?’ He knows that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Distress and anguish make him afraid. They prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Because he has stretched out his hand against God, and behaves himself proudly against the Almighty;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">he runs at him with a stiff neck, with the thick shields of his bucklers;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">because he has covered his face with his fatness, and gathered fat on his thighs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He has lived in desolate cities, in houses which no one inhabited, which were ready to become heaps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall their possessions be extended on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He shall not depart out of darkness. The flame shall dry up his branches. By the breath of God’s mouth shall he go away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself; for emptiness shall be his reward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">It shall be accomplished before his time. His branch shall not be green.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive tree.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For the company of the godless shall be barren, and fire shall consume the tents of bribery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity. Their heart prepares deceit.”</p>
