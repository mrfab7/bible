  <verse number="1">Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? Which way has he turned? We will seek him with you.</verse>
  <verse number="2">My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to pasture his flock in the gardens and to gather lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I belong to my beloved and he belongs to me; he pastures his flock among the lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="4">You are as beautiful, my darling, as Tirzah, as lovely as Jerusalem, as majestic as troops with banners.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Turn your eyes away from me, for they have overcome me. Your hair is like a flock of goats streaming down from Gilead.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Your teeth are like a flock of sheep coming up from the washing; each has its twin, and not one of them is lost.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Your brow behind your veil is like a slice of pomegranate.</verse>
  <verse number="8">There are sixty queens and eighty concubines, and maidens without number,</verse>
  <verse number="9">but my dove, my perfect one, is unique, the favorite of the mother who bore her. The maidens see her and call her blessed; the queens and concubines sing her praises.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Who is this who shines like the dawn, as fair as the moon, as bright as the sun, as majestic as the stars in procession?</verse>
  <verse number="11">I went down to the walnut grove to see the blossoms of the valley, to see if the vines were budding or the pomegranates were in bloom.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Before I realized it, my desire had set me among the royal chariots of my people.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Come back, come back, O Shulammite! Come back, come back, that we may gaze upon you. Why do you look at the Shulammite, as on the dance of Mahanaim?</verse>
