  <verse number="1">And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,</verse>
  <verse number="3">And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and [my] fatlings [are] killed, and all things [are] ready: come unto the marriage.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But they made light of [it], and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise:</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the remnant took his servants, and entreated [them] spitefully, and slew [them].</verse>
  <verse number="7">But when the king heard [thereof], he was wroth: and he sent forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.</verse>
  <verse number="10">So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment:</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast [him] into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For many are called, but few [are] chosen.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in [his] talk.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any [man]: for thou regardest not the person of men.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?</verse>
  <verse number="18">But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, [ye] hypocrites?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he saith unto them, Whose [is] this image and superscription?</verse>
  <verse number="21">They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.</verse>
  <verse number="22">When they had heard [these words], they marvelled, and left him, and went their way.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,</verse>
  <verse number="24">Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto his brother:</verse>
  <verse number="26">Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And last of all the woman died also.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="31">But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="32">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And when the multitude heard [this], they were astonished at his doctrine.</verse>
  <verse number="34">But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Then one of them, [which was] a lawyer, asked [him a question], tempting him, and saying,</verse>
  <verse number="36">Master, which [is] the great commandment in the law?</verse>
  <verse number="37">Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</verse>
  <verse number="38">This is the first and great commandment.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And the second [is] like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</verse>
  <verse number="40">On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="41">While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</verse>
  <verse number="42">Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, [The Son] of David.</verse>
  <verse number="43">He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="44">The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?</verse>
  <verse number="45">If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?</verse>
  <verse number="46">And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any [man] from that day forth ask him any more [questions].</verse>
