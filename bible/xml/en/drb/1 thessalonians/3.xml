  <verse number="1">For which cause, forbearing no longer, we thought it good to remain at Athens alone:</verse>
  <verse number="2">And we sent Timothy, our brother, and the minister of God in the gospel of Christ, to confirm you and exhort you concerning your faith:</verse>
  <verse number="3">That no man should be moved in these tribulations: for yourselves know, that we are appointed thereunto.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For even when we were with you, we foretold you that we should suffer tribulations, as also it is come to pass, and you know.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For this cause also, I, forbearing no longer, sent to know your faith: lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you, and our labour should be made vain.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But now when Timothy came to us from you, and related to us your faith and charity, and that you have a good remembrance of us always, desiring to see us as we also to see you;</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore we were comforted, brethren, in you, in all our necessity and tribulation, by your faith,</verse>
  <verse number="8">Because now we live, if you stand in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For what thanks can we return to God for you, in all the joy wherewith we rejoice for you before our God,</verse>
  <verse number="10">Night and day more abundantly praying that we may see your face, and may accomplish those things that are wanting to your faith?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And may the Lord multiply you, and make you abound in charity towards one another, and towards all men: as we do also towards you,</verse>
  <verse number="13">To confirm your hearts without blame, in holiness, before God and our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, with all his saints. Amen.</verse>
