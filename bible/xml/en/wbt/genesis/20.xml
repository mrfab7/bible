  <verse number="1">And Abraham journeyed from thence towards the south country, and dwelt between Kadash and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, she is my sister: And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, on account of the woman whom thou hast taken: for she is a man’s wife.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, Lord, wilt thou also slay a righteous nation?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Said he not to me, She is my sister? and she, even she herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart, and innocence of my hands have I done this.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And God said to him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me: therefore I suffered thee not to touch her.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now therefore restore to the man his wife, for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou shalt not restore her, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are thine.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the men were greatly afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him, What has thou done to us? and in what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done deeds to me that ought not to be done.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Abimelech said to Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this thing?</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Abraham said, Because I thought, surely the fear of God is not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife’s sake.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And yet indeed she is my sister: she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my father’s house, that I said to her, This is thy kindness which thou shalt show to me; At every place whither we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and men-servants, and women-servants, and gave them to Abraham, and restored to him Sarah his wife.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell where it pleaseth thee.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, to all that are with thee, and with all other: thus she was reproved.</verse>
  <verse number="17">So Abraham prayed to God: and God healed Abimelech, and his wife, and his maid-servants, and they bore children.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For the LORD had made barren all the females of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.</verse>
