  <verse number="1">And on the first of the sabbaths, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, bearing the spices they made ready, and certain others with them,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and they found the stone having been rolled away from the tomb,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and having gone in, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And it came to pass, while they are perplexed about this, that lo, two men stood by them in glittering apparel,</verse>
  <verse number="5">and on their having become afraid, and having inclined the face to the earth, they said to them, ‘Why do ye seek the living with the dead?</verse>
  <verse number="6">he is not here, but was raised; remember how he spake to you, being yet in Galilee,</verse>
  <verse number="7">saying—It behoveth the Son of Man to be delivered up to the hands of sinful men, and to be crucified, and the third day to rise again.’</verse>
  <verse number="8">And they remembered his sayings,</verse>
  <verse number="9">and having turned back from the tomb told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And it was the Magdalene Mary, and Joanna, and Mary of James, and the other women with them, who told unto the apostles these things,</verse>
  <verse number="11">and their sayings appeared before them as idle talk, and they were not believing them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Peter having risen, did run to the tomb, and having stooped down he seeth the linen clothes lying alone, and he went away to his own home, wondering at that which was come to pass.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And, lo, two of them were going on during that day to a village, distant sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, the name of which is Emmaus,</verse>
  <verse number="14">and they were conversing with one another about all these things that have happened.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And it came to pass in their conversing and reasoning together, that Jesus himself, having come nigh, was going on with them,</verse>
  <verse number="16">and their eyes were holden so as not to know him,</verse>
  <verse number="17">and he said unto them, ‘What are these words that ye exchange with one another, walking, and ye are sad?’</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the one, whose name was Cleopas, answering, said unto him, ‘Art thou alone such a stranger in Jerusalem, that thou hast not known the things that came to pass in it in these days?’</verse>
  <verse number="19">And he said to them, ‘What things?’ And they said to him, ‘The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who became a man—a prophet—powerful in deed and word, before God and all the people,</verse>
  <verse number="20">how also the chief priests and our rulers did deliver him up to a judgment of death, and crucified him;</verse>
  <verse number="21">and we were hoping that he it is who is about to redeem Israel, and also with all these things, this third day is passing to-day, since these things happened.</verse>
  <verse number="22">‘And certain women of ours also astonished us, coming early to the tomb,</verse>
  <verse number="23">and not having found his body, they came, saying also to have seen an apparition of messengers, who say he is alive,</verse>
  <verse number="24">and certain of those with us went away unto the tomb, and found as even the women said, and him they saw not.’</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he said unto them, ‘O inconsiderate and slow in heart, to believe on all that the prophets spake!</verse>
  <verse number="26">Was it not behoving the Christ these things to suffer, and to enter into his glory?’</verse>
  <verse number="27">and having begun from Moses, and from all the prophets, he was expounding to them in all the Writings the things about himself.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And they came nigh to the village whither they were going, and he made an appearance of going on further,</verse>
  <verse number="29">and they constrained him, saying, ‘Remain with us, for it is toward evening,’ and the day did decline, and he went in to remain with them.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And it came to pass, in his reclining (at meat) with them, having taken the bread, he blessed, and having broken, he was giving to them,</verse>
  <verse number="31">and their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he became unseen by them.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And they said one to another, ‘Was not our heart burning within us, as he was speaking to us in the way, and as he was opening up to us the Writings?’</verse>
  <verse number="33">And they, having risen up the same hour, turned back to Jerusalem, and found gathered together the eleven, and those with them,</verse>
  <verse number="34">saying—‘The Lord was raised indeed, and was seen by Simon;’</verse>
  <verse number="35">and they were telling the things in the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread,</verse>
  <verse number="36">and as they are speaking these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith to them, ‘Peace—to you;’</verse>
  <verse number="37">and being amazed, and becoming affrighted, they were thinking themselves to see a spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And he said to them, ‘Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do reasonings come up in your hearts?</verse>
  <verse number="39">see my hands and my feet, that I am he; handle me and see, because a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me having.’</verse>
  <verse number="40">And having said this, he shewed to them the hands and the feet,</verse>
  <verse number="41">and while they are not believing from the joy, and wondering, he said to them, ‘Have ye anything here to eat?’</verse>
  <verse number="42">and they gave to him part of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb,</verse>
  <verse number="43">and having taken, he did eat before them,</verse>
  <verse number="44">and he said to them, ‘These are the words that I spake unto you, being yet with you, that it behoveth to be fulfilled all the things that are written in the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms, about me.’</verse>
  <verse number="45">Then opened he up their understanding to understand the Writings,</verse>
  <verse number="46">and he said to them—‘Thus it hath been written, and thus it was behoving the Christ to suffer, and to rise out of the dead the third day,</verse>
  <verse number="47">and reformation and remission of sins to be proclaimed in his name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem:</verse>
  <verse number="48">and ye—ye are witnesses of these things.</verse>
  <verse number="49">‘And, lo, I do send the promise of my Father upon you, but ye—abide ye in the city of Jerusalem till ye be clothed with power from on high.’</verse>
  <verse number="50">And he led them forth without—unto Bethany, and having lifted up his hands he did bless them,</verse>
  <verse number="51">and it came to pass, in his blessing them, he was parted from them, and was borne up to the heaven;</verse>
  <verse number="52">and they, having bowed before him, did turn back to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
  <verse number="53">and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</verse>
