  <verse number="2">The nations shall see your righteousness, and all kings your glory, and you shall be called by a new name, which the mouth of Yahweh shall name.</verse>
  <verse number="3">You shall also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Yahweh, and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">You shall no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall your land any more be termed Desolate: but you shall be called Hephzibah, and your land Beulah; for Yahweh delights in you, and your land shall be married.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For as a young man marries a virgin, so your sons shall marry you; and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so your God will rejoice over you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I have set watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; they shall never hold their peace day nor night: you who call on Yahweh, take no rest,</verse>
  <verse number="7">and give him no rest, until he establishes, and until he makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Yahweh has sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, “Surely I will no more give your grain to be food for your enemies; and foreigners shall not drink your new wine, for which you have labored:</verse>
