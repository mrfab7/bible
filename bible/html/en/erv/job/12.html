<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I am as one that is a laughing-stock to his neighbour, a man that called upon God, and he answered him: the just, the perfect man is a laughing-stock.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">In the thought of him that is at ease there is contempt for misfortune; it is ready for them whose foot slippeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The tents of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who knoweth not in all these, that the hand of LORD hath wrought this?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Doth not the ear try words, even as the palate tasteth its meat?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">With aged men is wisdom, and in length of days understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">With him is wisdom and might; he hath counsel and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again; he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up; again, he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">With him is strength and effectual working; the deceived and the deceiver are his.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and judges maketh he fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He looseth the bond of kings, and bindeth their loins with a girdle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He leadeth priests away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He removeth the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the elders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He poureth contempt upon princes, and looseth the belt of the strong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he spreadeth the nations abroad, and bringeth them in.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He taketh away the heart of the chiefs of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.</p>
