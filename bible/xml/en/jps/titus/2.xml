  <verse number="1">But as for you, you must speak in a manner that befits wholesome teaching.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Exhort aged men to be temperate, grave, sober-minded, robust in their faith, their love and their patience.</verse>
  <verse number="3">In the same way exhort aged women to let their conduct be such as becomes consecrated persons. They must not be slanderers nor enslaved to wine-drinking. They must be teachers of what is right.</verse>
  <verse number="4">They should school the young women to be affectionate to their husbands and to their children, to be sober-minded, pure in their lives,</verse>
  <verse number="5">industrious in their homes, kind, submissive to their husbands, so that the Christian teaching may not be exposed to reproach.</verse>
  <verse number="6">In the same way exhort the younger men to be discreet,</verse>
  <verse number="7">and above all make your own life a pattern of right conduct, having in your teaching no taint of insincerity, but a serious tone,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and healthy language which no one can censure, so that our opponents may feel ashamed at having nothing evil to say against us.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Exhort slaves to be always obedient to their owners, and to give them satisfaction in everything, not contradicting and not pilfering,</verse>
  <verse number="10">but manifesting perfect fidelity and kind feeling, in order to bring honour to the teaching of our Saviour, God, in all things.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the grace of God has displayed itself with healing power to all mankind,</verse>
  <verse number="12">training us to renounce ungodliness and all the pleasures of this world, and to live sober, upright, and pious lives at the present time,</verse>
  <verse number="13">in expectation of the fulfilment of our blessed hope—the Appearing in glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="14">who gave Himself for us to purchase our freedom from all iniquity, and purify for Himself a people who should be specially His own, zealous for doing good works.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thus speak, exhort, reprove, with all impressiveness. Let no one make light of your authority.</verse>
