  <verse number="1">And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and sat before me.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Then came the word of the LORD to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="3">Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; Are you come to inquire of me? As I live, said the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? cause them to know the abominations of their fathers:</verse>
  <verse number="5">And say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand to the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known to them in the land of Egypt, when I lifted up my hand to them, saying, I am the LORD your God;</verse>
  <verse number="6">In the day that I lifted up my hand to them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands:</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then said I to them, Cast you away every man the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But they rebelled against me, and would not listen to me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the middle of the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But I worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Why I caused them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And I gave them my statutes, and showed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Moreover also I gave them my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the LORD that sanctify them.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted: then I said, I would pour out my fury on them in the wilderness, to consume them.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But I worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them out.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Yet also I lifted up my hand to them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands;</verse>
  <verse number="16">Because they despised my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but polluted my sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Nevertheless my eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But I said to their children in the wilderness, Walk you not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:</verse>
  <verse number="19">I am the LORD your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;</verse>
  <verse number="20">And hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I am the LORD your God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, neither kept my judgments to do them, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; they polluted my sabbaths: then I said, I would pour out my fury on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Nevertheless I withdrew my hand, and worked for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted in the sight of the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth.</verse>
  <verse number="23">I lifted up my hand to them also in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries;</verse>
  <verse number="24">Because they had not executed my judgments, but had despised my statutes, and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Why I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments whereby they should not live;</verse>
  <verse number="26">And I polluted them in their own gifts, in that they caused to pass through the fire all that opens the womb, that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, in that they have committed a trespass against me.</verse>
  <verse number="28">For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up my hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offering: there also they made their sweet smell, and poured out there their drink offerings.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Then I said to them, What is the high place whereunto you go? And the name whereof is called Bamah to this day.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Why say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord GOD; Are you polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit you prostitution after their abominations?</verse>
  <verse number="31">For when you offer your gifts, when you make your sons to pass through the fire, you pollute yourselves with all your idols, even to this day: and shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, said the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And that which comes into your mind shall not be at all, that you say, We will be as the heathen, as the families of the countries, to serve wood and stone.</verse>
  <verse number="33">As I live, said the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out, will I rule over you:</verse>
  <verse number="34">And I will bring you out from the people, and will gather you out of the countries wherein you are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, said the Lord GOD.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:</verse>
  <verse number="38">And I will purge out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them forth out of the country where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and you shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="39">As for you, O house of Israel, thus said the Lord GOD; Go you, serve you every one his idols, and hereafter also, if you will not listen to me: but pollute you my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.</verse>
  <verse number="40">For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, said the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the first fruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.</verse>
  <verse number="41">I will accept you with your sweet smell, when I bring you out from the people, and gather you out of the countries wherein you have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you before the heathen.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the country for the which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And there shall you remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein you have been defiled; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that you have committed.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And you shall know that I am the LORD when I have worked with you for my name’s sake, not according to your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O you house of Israel, said the Lord GOD.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="46">Son of man, set your face toward the south, and drop your word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;</verse>
  <verse number="47">And say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the LORD; Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north shall be burned therein.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And all flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.</verse>
  <verse number="49">Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Does he not speak parables?</verse>
