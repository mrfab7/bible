<chapter book="Ephesians" number="6" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Children, listen to your parents in the Lord: for this is just.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first command with solemn promise;)</verse>
  <verse number="3">That it may be well to thee, and thou mayest be long time upon earth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And, fathers, be not angry with your children: but bring them up in the instruction and reminding of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Servants, listen to lords according to the flesh, with fear and tremor, in simplicity of your heart, as to Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="6">Not with eye-service, as menpleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul:</verse>
  <verse number="7">With affection serving the Lord, and not men.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Knowing that whatever good each might do, this he shall receive from the Lord, whether a servant or free.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And, lords, do ye the same things to them, letting go threatening: knowing that also your own Lord is in the heavens; and distinction of persons is not with him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">As to the rest, my brethren, be strengthened in the Lord, and in the strength of his power.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Put on the complete armor of God, for you to be able to stand against the artifices of the accuser.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For the wrestling is not to us against blood and flesh, but against beginnings, against powers, against the chiefs of the world of darkness of this life, against spiritual things of wickedness in heavenly things.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For this take up the complete armor of God, that ye might be able to withstand in the evil day, and having effected all things, to stand.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Stand therefore, having girded your loins around with truth, and put on the armor of justice;</verse>
  <verse number="15">And fastened under the feet in preparation of the good news of peace;</verse>
  <verse number="16">Over all, having taken the shield of faith, in which ye shall be able to quench all the inflamed darts of evil.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And take ye the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:</verse>
  <verse number="18">By all prayer and supplication praying in all time in Spirit, and for this same watching vigilantly in all perseverance and supplication for the holy:</verse>
  <verse number="19">And for me, that the word might be given me, in the opening of my mouth in freedom of speech, to make known the mystery of the good news,</verse>
  <verse number="20">For which I am an ambassador in perplexity: that in it I might speak freely, as I ought to speak.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And that ye also might know the things concerning me, what I do, Tychicus will make all things known to you, the dearly beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord:</verse>
  <verse number="22">Whom I sent to you for this same, that ye might know the things concerning us, and he might comfort your hearts.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Peace to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Grace with all loving our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibleness. Amen.</verse>
