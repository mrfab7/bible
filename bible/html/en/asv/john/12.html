<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">So they made him a supper there: and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, that should betray him, saith,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred shillings, and given to the poor?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Now this he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he was there: and they came, not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Fear not, daughter of Zion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass’s colt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare witness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For this cause also the multitude went and met him, for that they heard that he had done this sign.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Behold how ye prevail nothing: lo, the world is gone after him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">these therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: Andrew cometh, and Philip, and they tell Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Jesus answereth them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He that loveth his life loseth it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will the Father honor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this cause came I unto this hour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Father, glorify thy name. There came therefore a voice out of heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">The multitude therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it had thundered: others said, An angel hath spoken to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Jesus answered and said, This voice hath not come for my sake, but for your sakes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto myself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">While ye have the light, believe on the light, that ye may become sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and he departed and hid himself from them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they believed not on him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">For this cause they could not believe, for that Isaiah said again,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">He hath blinded their eyes, and he hardened their heart; Lest they should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart, And should turn, And I should heal them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">These things said Isaiah, because he saw his glory; and he spake of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess it, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">for they loved the glory that is of men more than the glory that is of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">And he that beholdeth me beholdeth him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me may not abide in the darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">And if any man hear my sayings, and keep them not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my sayings, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I spake, the same shall judge him in the last day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">For I spake not from myself; but the Father that sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">And I know that his commandment is life eternal: the things therefore which I speak, even as the Father hath said unto me, so I speak.</p>
