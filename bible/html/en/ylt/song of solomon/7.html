<p class="verse" data-verse="1">As the chorus of ‘Mahanaim.’ How beautiful were thy feet with sandals, O daughter of Nadib. The turnings of thy sides are as ornaments, Work of the hands of an artificer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thy waist is a basin of roundness, It lacketh not the mixture, Thy body a heap of wheat, fenced with lilies,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thy two breasts as two young ones, twins of a roe,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thy neck as a tower of the ivory, Thine eyes pools in Heshbon, near the gate of Bath-Rabbim, Thy face as a tower of Lebanon looking to Damascus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thy head upon thee as Carmel, And the locks of thy head as purple, The king is bound with the flowings!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">How fair and how pleasant hast thou been, O love, in delights.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">This thy stature hath been like to a palm, And thy breasts to clusters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I said, ‘Let me go up on the palm, Let me lay hold on its boughs, Yea, let thy breasts be, I pray thee, as clusters of the vine, And the fragrance of thy face as citrons,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And thy palate as the good wine—‘Flowing to my beloved in uprightness, Strengthening the lips of the aged!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I am my beloved’s, and on me is his desire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Come, my beloved, we go forth to the field,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">We lodge in the villages, we go early to the vineyards, We see if the vine hath flourished, The sweet smelling-flower hath opened. The pomegranates have blossomed, There do I give to thee my loves;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The mandrakes have given fragrance, And at our openings all pleasant things, New, yea, old, my beloved, I laid up for thee!</p>
