  <verse number="1">And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by you we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done to this nation by your providence,</verse>
  <verse number="3">We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious to you, I pray you that you would hear us of your clemency a few words.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</verse>
  <verse number="6">Who also has gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But the chief captain Lysias came on us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,</verse>
  <verse number="8">Commanding his accusers to come to you: by examining of whom yourself may take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned to him to speak, answered, For as much as I know that you have been of many years a judge to this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:</verse>
  <verse number="11">Because that you may understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city:</verse>
  <verse number="13">Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But this I confess to you, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:</verse>
  <verse number="15">And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offense toward God, and toward men.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Who ought to have been here before you, and object, if they had ought against me.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,</verse>
  <verse number="21">Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come to him.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go your way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for you.</verse>
  <verse number="26">He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: why he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room: and Felix, willing to show the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</verse>
