<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And say to the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couching-place for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped thy hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, therefore I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like all the heathen;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Therefore behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">To the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it for the old hatred;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.</p>
