  <verse number="1">My son, if thou dost accept my sayings, And my commands dost lay up with thee,</verse>
  <verse number="2">To cause thine ear to attend to wisdom, Thou inclinest thy heart to understanding,</verse>
  <verse number="3">For, if for intelligence thou callest, For understanding givest forth thy voice,</verse>
  <verse number="4">If thou dost seek her as silver, And as hid treasures searchest for her,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then understandest thou fear of Jehovah, And knowledge of God thou findest.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For Jehovah giveth wisdom, From His mouth knowledge and understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Even to lay up for the upright substance, A shield for those walking uprightly.</verse>
  <verse number="8">To keep the paths of judgment, And the way of His saints He preserveth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then understandest thou righteousness, And judgment, and uprightness—every good path.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For wisdom cometh into thy heart, And knowledge to thy soul is pleasant,</verse>
  <verse number="11">Thoughtfulness doth watch over thee, Understanding doth keep thee,</verse>
  <verse number="12">To deliver thee from an evil way, From any speaking froward things,</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who are forsaking paths of uprightness, To walk in ways of darkness,</verse>
  <verse number="14">Who are rejoicing to do evil, They delight in frowardness of the wicked,</verse>
  <verse number="15">Whose paths are crooked, Yea, they are perverted in their ways.</verse>
  <verse number="16">To deliver thee from the strange woman, From the stranger who hath made smooth her sayings,</verse>
  <verse number="17">Who is forsaking the guide of her youth, And the covenant of her God hath forgotten.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For her house hath inclined unto death, And unto Rephaim her paths.</verse>
  <verse number="19">None going in unto her turn back, Nor do they reach the paths of life.</verse>
  <verse number="20">That thou dost go in the way of the good, And the paths of the righteous dost keep.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For the upright do inhabit the earth, And the perfect are left in it,</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the wicked from the earth are cut off, And treacherous dealers plucked out of it!</verse>
