<chapter book="Proverbs" number="7" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My son, keep my words, and lay up my precepts with thee. Son,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Keep my commandments, and thou shalt live: and my law as the apple of thy eye:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Bind it upon thy fingers, write it upon the tables of thy heart.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Say to wisdom: Thou art my sister: and call prudence thy friend,</verse>
  <verse number="5">That she may keep thee from the woman that is not thine, and from the stranger who sweeteneth her words.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For I look out of the window of my house through the lattice,</verse>
  <verse number="7">And I see little ones, I behold a foolish young man,</verse>
  <verse number="8">Who passeth through the street by the corner, and goeth nigh the way of her house.</verse>
  <verse number="9">In the dark, when it grows late, in the darkness and obscurity of the night,</verse>
  <verse number="10">And behold a woman meeteth him in harlot’s attire prepared to deceive souls; talkative and wandering,</verse>
  <verse number="11">Not bearing to be quiet, not able to abide still at home,</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now abroad, now in the streets, now lying in wait near the corners.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And catching the young man, she kisseth him, and with an impudent face, flattereth, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="14">I vowed victims for prosperity, this day I have paid my vows.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Therefore I am come out to meet thee, desirous to see thee, and I have found thee.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I have woven my bed with cords, I have covered it with painted tapestry, brought from Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Come, let us be inebriated with the breasts, and let us enjoy the desired embraces, till the day appear.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For my husband is not at home, he is gone a very long journey.</verse>
  <verse number="20">He took with him a bag of money: he mill return home the day of the full moon.</verse>
  <verse number="21">She entangled him with many words, and drew him away with the flattery of her lips.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Immediately he followeth her as an ox led to be a victim, and as a lamb playing the wanton, and not knowing that he is drawn like a fool to bonds,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Till the arrow pierce his liver: as if a bird should make haste to the snare, and knoweth not that his life is in danger.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Now therefore, my son, hear me, and attend to the words of my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Let not thy mind be drawn away in her ways: neither be thou deceived with her paths.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For she hath cast down many wounded, and the strongest have been slain by her.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Her house is the way to hell, reaching even to the inner chambers of death.</verse>
