1	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
2	Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
3	We ought to return thanks to God always for you, brethren, as is fitting, for your faith increases exceedingly, and the love of each one of you all enlarges to one another;
4	So that we ourselves boast in you in all the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your expulsions and pressures which ye endure:
5	(A proof of the just judgment of God,) for you to be deemed worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:
6	Even though just with God to return pressure to them pressing you;
7	And to you being pressed a release with us, in the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with the angels of his power,
8	In fire of flame giving vengeance to them not knowing God, and to them not listening to the good news of our Lord Jesus Christ:
9	Who shall undergo punishment, eternal ruin from the face of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;
10	When he should come to be honoured in his holy ones, and to be admired in all the believing, (that our testimony among you was believed) in that day.
11	For which also we pray always for you, that our God would deem you worthy of the calling, and fill all the benevolence of goodness, and work of faith in power:
12	So that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ be honoured in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
