<p class="verse" data-verse="1">NOW there was a certain man sick, named Lazarus, of Bethania, of the town of Mary and Martha her sister.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">(And Mary was she that anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair: whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">His sisters therefore sent to him, saying: Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Jesus hearing it, said to them: This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God: that the Son of God may be glorified by it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister Mary, and Lazarus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he still remained in the same place two days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Then after that, he said to his disciples: Let us go into Judea again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The disciples say to him: Rabbi, the Jews but now sought to stone thee: and goest thou thither again?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Jesus answered: Are there not twelve hours of the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But if he walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">These things he said; and after that he said to them: Lazarus our friend sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">His disciples therefore said: Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But Jesus spoke of his death; and they thought that he spoke of the repose of sleep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then therefore Jesus said to them plainly: Lazarus is dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And I am glad, for your sakes, that I was not there, that you may believe: but let us go to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples: Let us also go, that we may die with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Jesus therefore came, and found that he had been four days already in the grave.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">(Now Bethania was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Martha therefore, as soon as she heard that Jesus had come, went to meet him: but Mary sat at home.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Martha therefore said to Jesus: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But now also I know that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Jesus saith to her: Thy brother shall rise again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Martha saith to him: I know that he shall rise again, in the resurrection at the last day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Jesus said to her: I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, although he be dead, shall live:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And every one that liveth, and believeth in me, shall not die for ever. Believest thou this?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">She saith to him: Yea, Lord, I have believed that thou art Christ the Son of the living God, who art come into this world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And when she had said these things, she went, and called her sister Mary secretly, saying: The master is come, and calleth for thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">She, as soon as she heard this, riseth quickly, and cometh to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">For Jesus was not yet come into the town: but he was still in that place where Martha had met him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The Jews therefore, who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary that she rose up speedily and went out, followed her, saying: She goeth to the grave to weep there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">When Mary therefore was come where Jesus was, seeing him, she fell down at his feet, and saith to him: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews that were come with her, weeping, groaned in the spirit, and troubled himself,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And said: Where have you laid him? They say to him: Lord, come and see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And Jesus wept.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">The Jews therefore said: Behold how he loved him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">But some of them said: Could not he that opened the eyes of the man born blind, have caused that this man should not die?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">Jesus therefore again groaning in himself, cometh to the sepulchre. Now it was a cave; and a stone was laid over it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Jesus saith: Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him: Lord, by this time he stinketh, for he is now of four days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Jesus saith to her: Did not I say to thee, that if thou believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">They took therefore the stone away. And Jesus lifting up his eyes said: Father, I give thee thanks that thou hast heard me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And I knew that thou hearest me always; but because of the people who stand about have I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">When he had said these things, he cried with a loud voice: Lazarus, come forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And presently he that had been dead came forth, bound feet and hands with winding bands; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said to them: Loose him, and let him go.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Many therefore of the Jews, who were come to Mary and Martha, and had seen the things that Jesus did, believed in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them the things that Jesus had done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">The chief priests therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered a council, and said: What do we, for this man doth many miracles?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">If we let him alone so, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and take away our place and nation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">But one of them, named Caiphas, being the high priest that year, said to them: You know nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">Neither do you consider that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">And this he spoke not of himself: but being the high priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">And not only for the nation, but to gather together in one the children of God, that were dispersed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">From that day therefore they devised to put him to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">Wherefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews; but he went into a country near the desert, unto a city that is called Ephrem, and there he abode with his disciples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">And the pasch of the Jews was at hand; and many from the country went up to Jerusalem, before the pasch to purify themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">They sought therefore for Jesus; and they discoursed one with another, standing in the temple: What think you that he is not come to the festival day?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="57">And the chief priests and Pharisees had given a commandment, that if any man knew where he was, he should tell, that they might apprehend him.</p>
