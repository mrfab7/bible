<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And it will be as David will sit in his house, and David will say to Nathan the prophet, Behold me dwelling in a house of cedars, and the ark of the covenant of Jehovah under curtains.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Nathan will say to David, Do all that is thy heart; for God is with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And it will be in that night, and the word of God will be to Nathan, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Go and say to David my servant, Thus said Jehovah, Thou shalt not build to me a house to dwell in:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For I dwelt not in a house from the day that I brought up Israel even to this day: and I will be from tent to tent, and from a dwelling.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In all that I went about in all Israel, spake I the word with one of the judges of Israel that I commanded to feed my people, saying, Wherefore built ye not to me a house of cedars.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And now, thus shalt thou say to my servant, to David, Thus said Jehovah of armies, I took thee from the dwelling from behind the flocks to be leader over my people Israel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And I will be with thee in all which thou walkedst, and I will cut off all thine enemies from thy face, and I made to thee a name as the name of the great ones which are in the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And I set a place for my people Israel, and I planted him, and he dwelt in his place, and he shall no more be disturbed; and the sons of evil shall not add to vex him, as in the beginning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And to the days which I commanded judges over my people Israel; and I brought low all thine enemies. And I will announce to thee, and Jehovah will build a house to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And it was When thy days were completed to go with thy fathers, and I raised up thy seed after thee, which shall be from thy sons; and I prepared his kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He shall build to me a house, and I prepared his throne even to forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">I will be to him for father, and he shall be to me for son: and my mercy will I not remove from him as I removed from him being before thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And I caused him to stand in my house and in my kingdom even to forever: and his throne shall be set up even to forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so spake Nathan the prophet to David.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And king David will come and sit before Jehovah, and he will say, Who am I, O Jehovah God, and what my house, that thou broughtest me even to hither?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And this will be small in thine eyes, O God; and thou wilt speak upon the house of thy servant to far off, and thou sawest me according to the manner of the man of the ascent, O Jehovah God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">What more shall David add to thee to honor thy servant? for thou knewest thy servant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">O Jehovah, for sake of thy servant, and according to thy heart, thou didst all this greatness to make known all thy greatnesses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">O Jehovah, none like thee, and no God besides thee, in all that we heard with our ears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And what one nation as thy people Israel, in the earth, whom God went to redeem to him a people to set up to thee a name of greatnesses and terrible things, to thrust out nations from before thy people, whom thou didst redeem from Egypt?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And thou wilt give thy people Israel to thee for a people even to forever; and thou, O Jehovah, wert to them for God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And now, O Jehovah, the word which thou spakest concerning thy servant and concerning his house, shall be faithful even to forever, and do as thou spakest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And it shall be firm, and thy name shall be magnified even to forever, saying, Jehovah of armies, God of Israel, is God to Israel: and the house of David thy servant was prepared before thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For thou, my God, didst uncover the ear of thy servant to build for him a house: for this thy servant found to pray before thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And now, O Jehovah, thou thyself art God, and thou wilt speak concerning thy servant this goodness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And now thou wert pleased to bless the house of thy servant, to be forever before thee: for thou didst bless, and blessing forever.</p>
