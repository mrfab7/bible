<chapter book="Ecclesiastes" number="6" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">There is also another evil, which I have seen under the sun, and, indeed, it is frequent among men.</verse>
  <verse number="2">It is a man to whom God has given wealth, and resources, and honor; and out of all that he desires, nothing is lacking to his life; yet God does not grant him the ability to consume these things, but instead a man who is a stranger will devour them. This is emptiness and a great misfortune.</verse>
  <verse number="3">If a man were to produce one hundred children, and to live for many years, and to attain to an age of many days, and if his soul were to make no use of the goods of his resources, and if he were lacking even a burial: concerning such a man, I declare that a miscarried child is better than he.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For he arrives without a purpose and he continues on into darkness, and his name shall be wiped away, into oblivion.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He has not seen the sun, nor recognized the difference between good and evil.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Even if he were to live for two thousand years, and yet not thoroughly enjoy what is good, does not each one hurry on to the same place?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Every labor of man is for his mouth, but his soul will not be filled.</verse>
  <verse number="8">What do the wise have which is more than the foolish? And what does the pauper have, except to continue on to that place, where there is life?</verse>
  <verse number="9">It is better to see what you desire, than to desire what you cannot know. But this, too, is emptiness and a presumption of spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Whoever shall be in the future, his name has already been called. And it is known that he is a man and that he is not able to contend in judgment against one who is stronger than himself.</verse>
  <verse number="11">There are many words, and many of these, in disputes, hold much emptiness.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Why is it necessary for a man to seek things that are greater than himself, when he does not know what is advantageous for himself in his life, during the number of the days of his sojourn, and while time passes by like a shadow? Or who will be able to tell him what will be in the future after him under the sun?</verse>
