<chapter book="1 Peter" number="2" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Therefore, set aside all malice and all deceitfulness, as well as falseness and envy and every detraction.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Like newborn infants, desire the milk of reasonableness without guile, so that by this you may increase unto salvation,</verse>
  <verse number="3">if it is true that you have tasted that the Lord is sweet.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And approaching him as if he were a living stone, rejected by men, certainly, but elect and honored by God,</verse>
  <verse number="5">be also yourselves like living stones, built upon him, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, so as to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Because of this, Scripture asserts: “Behold, I am setting in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious. And whoever will have believed in him will not be confounded.”</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore, to you who believe, he is honor. But to those who do not believe, the stone which the builders have rejected, the same has been made into the head of the corner,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and a stone of offense, and a rock of scandal, to those who are offended by the Word; neither do they believe, though they also have been built upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, an acquired people, so that you may announce the virtues of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Though in past times you were not a people, yet now you are the people of God. Though you had not obtained mercy, yet now you have obtained mercy.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Most beloved, I beg you, as new arrivals and sojourners, to abstain from carnal desires, which battle against the soul.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Keep your behavior among the Gentiles to what is good, so that, when they slander you as if you were evildoers, they may, by the good works that are seen in you, glorify God on the day of visitation.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Therefore, be subject to every human creature because of God, whether it is to the king as preeminent,</verse>
  <verse number="14">or to leaders as having been sent from him for vindication over evildoers, it is truly for the praise of what is good.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For such is the will of God, that by doing good you may bring about the silence of imprudent and ignorant men,</verse>
  <verse number="16">in an open manner, and not as if cloaking malice with liberty, but like servants of God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Honor everyone. Love brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and meek, but also to the unruly.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For this is grace: when, because of God, a man willingly endures sorrows, suffering injustice.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For what glory is there, if you sin and then suffer a beating? But if you do well and suffer patiently, this is grace with God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For you have been called to this because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example, so that you would follow in his footsteps.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And when evil was spoken against him, he did not speak evil. When he suffered, he did not threaten. Then he handed himself over to him who judged him unjustly.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He himself bore our sins in his body upon the tree, so that we, having died to sin, would live for justice. By his wounds, you have been healed.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For you were like wandering sheep. But now you have been turned back toward the Pastor and the Bishop of your souls.</verse>
