<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Balances of deceit are an abomination to Jehovah, And a perfect weight is His delight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Pride hath come, and shame cometh, And with the lowly is wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The integrity of the upright leadeth them, And the perverseness of the treacherous destroyeth them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Wealth profiteth not in a day of wrath, And righteousness delivereth from death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The righteousness of the perfect maketh right his way, And by his wickedness doth the wicked fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The righteousness of the upright delivereth them, And in mischief the treacherous are captured.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In the death of a wicked man, hope perisheth, And the expectation of the iniquitous hath been lost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The righteous from distress is drawn out, And the wicked goeth in instead of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">With the mouth a hypocrite corrupteth his friend, And by knowledge the righteous are drawn out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">In the good of the righteous a city exulteth, And in the destruction of the wicked is singing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">By the blessing of the upright is a city exalted, And by the mouth of the wicked thrown down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Whoso is despising his neighbour lacketh heart, And a man of understanding keepeth silence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A busybody is revealing secret counsel, And the faithful of spirit is covering the matter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Without counsels do a people fall, And deliverance is in a multitude of counsellors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Evil one suffereth when he hath been surety for a stranger, And whoso is hating suretyship is confident.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A gracious woman retaineth honour, And terrible men retain riches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A kind man is rewarding his own soul, And the fierce is troubling his own flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The wicked is getting a lying wage, And whoso is sowing righteousness—a true reward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Rightly is righteousness for life, And whoso is pursuing evil—for his own death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">An abomination to Jehovah are the perverse of heart, And the perfect of the way are His delight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Hand to hand, the wicked is not acquitted, And the seed of the righteous hath escaped.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A ring of gold in the nose of a sow—A fair woman and stubborn of behaviour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The desire of the righteous is only good, The hope of the wicked is transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">There is who is scattering, and yet is increased, And who is keeping back from uprightness, only to want.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">A liberal soul is made fat, And whoso is watering, he also is watered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Whoso is withholding corn, the people execrate him, And a blessing is for the head of him who is selling.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Whoso is earnestly seeking good Seeketh a pleasing thing, And whoso is seeking evil—it meeteth him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Whoso is confident in his wealth he falleth, And as a leaf, the righteous flourish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Whoso is troubling his own house inheriteth wind, And a servant is the fool to the wise of heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, And whoso is taking souls is wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Lo, the righteous in the earth is recompensed, Surely also the wicked and the sinner!</p>
