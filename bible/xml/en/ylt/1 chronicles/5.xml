  <verse number="1">As to sons of Reuben, first-born of Israel—for he is the first-born, and on account of his profaning the couch of his father hath his birthright been given to the sons of Joseph son of Israel, and he is not to be reckoned by genealogy for the birthright,</verse>
  <verse number="2">for Judah hath been mighty over his brother, and for leader above him, and the birthright is to Joseph.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Sons of Reuben, first-born of Israel: Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.</verse>

  <verse number="7">And his brethren, by their families, in the genealogy of their generations, are heads: Jeiel, and Zechariah,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and Bela son of Azaz, son of Shema, son of Joel—he is dwelling in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baal-Meon;</verse>
  <verse number="9">and at the east he dwelt even unto the entering in of the wilderness, even from the river Phrat, for their cattle were multiplied in the land of Gilead.</verse>

  <verse number="12">Joel the head, and Shapham the second, and Jaanai and Shaphat in Bashan;</verse>
  <verse number="13">and their brethren of the house of their fathers are Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jachan, and Zia, and Heber, seven.</verse>

  <verse number="17">all of them reckoned themselves by genealogy in the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Sons of Reuben, and the Gadite, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh, of sons of valour, men bearing shield and sword, and treading bow, and taught in battle, are forty and four thousand and seven hundred and sixty, going out to the host.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And they make war with the Hagarites, and Jetur, and Naphish, and Nodab,</verse>
  <verse number="20">and they are helped against them, and the Hagarites are given into their hand, and all who are with them, for they cried to God in battle, and He was entreated of them, because they trusted in Him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they take captive their cattle, of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of human beings a hundred thousand;</verse>
  <verse number="22">for many have fallen pierced, for of God is the battle; and they dwell in their stead till the removal.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And the sons of the half of the tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land, from Bashan unto Baal-Hermon, and Senir, and mount Hermon, they have multiplied.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And these are heads of the house of their fathers, even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, men mighty in valour, men of name, heads to the house of their fathers.</verse>

  <verse number="26">and stir up doth the God of Israel the spirit of Pul king of Asshur, and the spirit of Tilgath-Pilneser king of Asshur, and he removeth them—even the Reubenite, and the Gadite, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh—and bringeth them in to Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and the river of Gozan unto this day.</verse>
