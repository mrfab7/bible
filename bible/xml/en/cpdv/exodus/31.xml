  <verse number="1">And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Behold, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, from the tribe of Judah,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, and understanding, and knowledge in every craft,</verse>
  <verse number="4">in order to design whatever must be fabricated from gold, and silver, and brass,</verse>
  <verse number="5">from marble, and precious stones, and various woods.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And I have given to him, as his associate, Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, from the tribe of Dan. And I have placed wisdom in the heart of every artisan, so that they may make everything as I have instructed you:</verse>
  <verse number="7">the tabernacle of the covenant, and the ark of the testimony, and the propitiatory which is over it, and all the vessels of the tabernacle,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and the table and its vessels, the most pure lampstand with its vessels, and the altars of incense</verse>
  <verse number="9">and of holocaust and all their vessels, the washtub with its base,</verse>
  <verse number="10">the holy vestments for the ministry of Aaron the priest, and for his sons, so that they may execute their office of sacred rites,</verse>
  <verse number="11">the oil of unction, and the incense of aromatics in the Sanctuary. All the things that I have instructed you, they shall make.”</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="13">“Speak to the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them: See that you keep my Sabbath. For it is a sign between me and you among your generations, so that you may know that I am the Lord, who sanctifies you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Keep my Sabbath, for it is holy to you. Whoever will have polluted it, shall die a death. Whoever will have done any work in it, his soul shall perish from the midst of his people.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For six days you shall do work. On the seventh day, it is the Sabbath, a rest sanctified by the Lord. All who will have done work on this day shall die.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Let the sons of Israel keep the Sabbath, and let them celebrate it throughout their generations. It is an everlasting covenant</verse>
  <verse number="17">between me and the sons of Israel, and a perpetual sign. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and in the seventh he ceased from work.”</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the Lord, having completed speaking in this way on Mount Sinai, gave to Moses two stone tablets of testimony, written with the finger of God.</verse>
