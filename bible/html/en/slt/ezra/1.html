<p class="verse" data-verse="1">In one year to Cyrus the king of Persia, to complete the word of Jehovah from the month of Jeremiah, Jehovah roused up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, and he will cause a voice to pass through in all his kingdom, and also in writing, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thus said Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth Jehovah gave to me, the God of the heavens; and he charged upon me to build for him a house in Jerusalem which is in Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Who among you from all his people? His God shall be with him, and he shall go up to Jerusalem which is in Judah, and he shall build the house of Jehovah God of Israel, (he is the God) Which is in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And every one being left in all the places where he sojourned there, the men of his place shall lift him up with silver and with gold, and with substance, and with cattle, with a voluntary gift to the house of God which is in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And there will rise up the heads to the fathers to Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites to all God roused up his spirit, to go up to build the house of Jehovah which is in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And all those round about them strengthened upon their hands with vessels of silver, with gold, with substance, and with cattle, and most precious things, besides all being willingly given.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the king Cyrus brought forth the vessels of the house of Jehovah, which Nebuchadnezzar brought forth from Jerusalem; and he will give them into the house of his God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Cyrus king of Persia will bring them forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and he will number them to Sheshbazzar, prince to Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And these their number: thirty basins of gold, a thousand basins of silver, nine and twenty slaughter knives,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thirty goblets of gold, four hundred and ten goblets of silver, being different, a thousand other vessels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">All the vessels to the gold and to the silver, five thousand and four hundred. Sheshbazzar brought up all with the bringing up of the captivity from Babel to Jerusalem.</p>
