<chapter book="1 Samuel" number="10" translation="Webster Bible Translation" translationID="wbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?</verse>
  <verse number="2">When thou hast departed from me to-day, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel’s sepulcher in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to thee, The asses which thou wentest to seek are found: and lo, thy father hath left the care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men going up to God to Beth-el, one carrying three kids, and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a bottle of wine:</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive from their hands.</verse>
  <verse number="5">After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when thou hast come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp before them; and they will prophesy:</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And let it be, when these signs have come to thee, that thou do as occasion shall serve thee; for God is with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come down to thee, to offer burnt-offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace-offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and show thee what thou shalt do.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came to pass that day.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he prophesied among them.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it came to pass when all that formerly knew him saw, that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What is this that hath come to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?</verse>
  <verse number="12">And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?</verse>
  <verse number="13">And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant, Whither went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that they were no where, we came to Samuel.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, What Samuel said to you.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he told him not.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Samuel called the people together to the LORD to Mizpeh;</verse>
  <verse number="18">And said to the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:</verse>
  <verse number="19">And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities, and your tribulations; and ye have said to him, No, but set a king over us. Now therefore present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your thousands.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.</verse>
  <verse number="21">When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be found.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Therefore they inquired of the LORD further, if the man would yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold, he hath hid himself among the stuff.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they ran and brought him thence: and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a band of men, whose hearts God had touched.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought him no presents. But he held his peace.</verse>
