<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Furthermore Elihu answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear my words, O ye wise [men]; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what [is] good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Should I lie against my right? my wound [is] incurable without transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">What man [is] like Job, [who] drinketh up scorning like water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, [that he should do] wickedness; and [from] the Almighty, [that he should commit] iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to [his] ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If he set his heart upon man, [if] he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If now [thou hast] understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">[Is it fit] to say to a king, [Thou art] wicked? [and] to princes, [Ye are] ungodly?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">[How much less to him] that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all [are] the work of his hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For his eyes [are] upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">[There is] no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For he will not lay upon man more [than right]; that he should enter into judgment with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth [them] in the night, so that they are destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth [his] face, who then can behold him? whether [it be done] against a nation, or against a man only:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne [chastisement], I will not offend [any more]:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">[That which] I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">[Should it be] according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words [were] without wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">My desire [is that] Job may be tried unto the end because of [his] answers for wicked men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth [his hands] among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</p>
