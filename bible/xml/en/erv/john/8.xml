  <verse number="1">but Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the scribes and the Pharisees bring a woman taken in adultery; and having set her in the midst,</verse>
  <verse number="4">they say unto him, Master, this woman hath been taken in adultery, in the very act.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such: what then sayest thou of her?</verse>
  <verse number="6">And this they said, tempting him, that they might have whereof to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And again he stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they, when they heard it, went out one by one, beginning from the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman, where she was, in the midst.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Jesus lifted up himself, and said unto her, Woman, where are they? did no man condemn thee?</verse>
  <verse number="11">And she said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said, Neither do I condemn thee: go thy way; from henceforth sin no more.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Again therefore Jesus spake unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in the darkness, but shall have the light of life.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Jesus answered and said unto them, Even if I bear witness of myself, my witness is true; for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye know not whence I come, or whither I go.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Yea and if I judge, my judgment is true; for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Yea and in your law it is written, that the witness of two men is true.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I am he that beareth witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">They said therefore unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye know neither me, nor my Father: if ye knew me, ye would know my Father also.</verse>
  <verse number="20">These words spake he in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man took him; because his hour was not yet come.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He said therefore again unto them, I go away, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sin: whither I go, ye cannot come.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The Jews therefore said, Will he kill himself, that he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come?</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</verse>
  <verse number="24">I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for except ye believe that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.</verse>
  <verse number="25">They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? Jesus said unto them, Even that which I have also spoken unto you from the beginning.</verse>
  <verse number="26">I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you: howbeit he that sent me is true; and the things which I heard from him, these speak I unto the world.</verse>
  <verse number="27">They perceived not that he spake to them of the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Jesus therefore said, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father taught me, I speak these things.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he that sent me is with me; he hath not left me alone; for I do always the things that are pleasing to him.</verse>
  <verse number="30">As he spake these things, many believed on him.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Jesus therefore said to those Jews which had believed him, If ye abide in my word, then are ye truly my disciples;</verse>
  <verse number="32">and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</verse>
  <verse number="33">They answered unto him, We be Abraham’s seed, and have never yet been in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</verse>
  <verse number="34">Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Every one that committeth sin is the bondservant of sin.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the bondservant abideth not in the house for ever: the son abideth for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="36">If therefore the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</verse>
  <verse number="37">I know that ye are Abraham’s seed; yet ye seek to kill me, because my word hath not free course in you.</verse>
  <verse number="38">I speak the things which I have seen with my Father: and ye also do the things which ye heard from your father.</verse>
  <verse number="39">They answered and said unto him, Our father is Abraham. Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham’s children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="40">But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I heard from God: this did not Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Ye do the works of your father. They said unto him, We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</verse>
  <verse number="42">Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I came forth and am come from God; for neither have I come of myself, but he sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Why do ye not understand my speech? Even because ye cannot hear my word.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father it is your will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and stood not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="45">But because I say the truth, ye believe me not.</verse>
  <verse number="46">Which of you convicteth me of sin? If I say truth, why do ye not believe me?</verse>
  <verse number="47">He that is of God heareth the words of God: for this cause ye hear them not, because ye are not of God.</verse>
  <verse number="48">The Jews answered and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</verse>
  <verse number="49">Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye dishonour me.</verse>
  <verse number="50">But I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</verse>
  <verse number="51">Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my word, he shall never see death.</verse>
  <verse number="52">The Jews said unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my word, he shall never taste of death.</verse>
  <verse number="53">Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</verse>
  <verse number="54">Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing: it is my Father that glorifieth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God;</verse>
  <verse number="55">and ye have not known him: but I know him; and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be like unto you, a liar: but I know him, and keep his word.</verse>
  <verse number="56">Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.</verse>
  <verse number="57">The Jews therefore said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</verse>
  <verse number="58">Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</verse>
  <verse number="59">They took up stones therefore to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.</verse>
