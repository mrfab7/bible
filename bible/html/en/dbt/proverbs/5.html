<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, attend unto my wisdom, incline thine ear to my understanding;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">that thou mayest keep reflection, and that thy lips may preserve knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the lips of the strange woman drop honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">but her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on Sheol.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Lest she should ponder the path of life, her ways wander, she knoweth not [whither].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And now, children, hearken unto me, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">lest strangers be filled with thy wealth, and the fruits of thy toil [come] into the house of a stranger;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and thou mourn in thine end, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">and thou say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and I have not hearkened unto the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to those that instructed me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I was well nigh in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Thy fountains shall be poured forth, as water-brooks in the broadways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Let them be only thine own, and not strangersâ€™ with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Let thy fountain be blessed; and have joy of the wife of thy youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">As a lovely hind and a graceful roe, let her breasts satisfy thee at all times: be thou ravished continually with her love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah, and he pondereth all his paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">His own iniquities shall take the wicked, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He shall die for want of discipline; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</p>
