  <verse number="1">Now the LORD had said to Abram, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and from your father’s house, to a land that I will show you:</verse>
  <verse number="2">And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great; and you shall be a blessing:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I will bless them that bless you, and curse him that curses you: and in you shall all families of the earth be blessed.</verse>
  <verse number="4">So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken to him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To your seed will I give this land: and there built he an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he removed from there to a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he built an altar to the LORD, and called on the name of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said to Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that you are a fair woman to look on:</verse>
  <verse number="12">Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see you, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save you alive.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Say, I pray you, you are my sister: that it may be well with me for your sake; and my soul shall live because of you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that you have done to me? why did you not tell me that she was your wife?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Why said you, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold your wife, take her, and go your way.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.</verse>
