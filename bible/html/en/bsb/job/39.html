<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="39" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“Do you know when mountain goats give birth? Have you watched the doe bear her fawn?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Can you count the months they are pregnant? Do you know the time they give birth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They crouch down and bring forth their young; they deliver their newborn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Their young ones thrive and grow up in the open field; they leave and do not return.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who set the wild donkey free? Who released the swift donkey from the harness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I made the wilderness his home and the salt flats his dwelling.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He scorns the tumult of the city and never hears the shouts of a driver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He roams the mountains for pasture, searching for any green thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Will the wild ox consent to serve you? Will he stay by your manger at night?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Can you hold him to the furrow with a harness? Will he plow the valleys behind you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Can you rely on his great strength? Will you leave your hard work to him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Can you trust him to bring in your grain and gather it to your threshing floor?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, but cannot match the pinions and feathers of the stork.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For she leaves her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">She forgets that a foot may crush them, or a wild animal may trample them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">She treats her young harshly, as if not her own, with no concern that her labor was in vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For God has deprived her of wisdom; He has not endowed her with understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Yet when she proudly spreads her wings, she laughs at the horse and its rider.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Do you give strength to the horse or adorn his neck with a mane?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Do you make him leap like a locust, striking terror with his proud snorting?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He paws in the valley and rejoices in his strength; he charges into battle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He laughs at fear, frightened of nothing; he does not turn back from the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">A quiver rattles at his side, along with a flashing spear and lance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Trembling with excitement, he devours the distance; he cannot stand still when the ram’s horn sounds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">At the blast of the horn, he snorts with fervor. He catches the scent of battle from afar, the shouts of captains and the cry of war.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Does the hawk take flight by your understanding and spread his wings toward the south?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Does the eagle soar at your command and make his nest on high?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He dwells on a cliff and lodges there; his stronghold is on a rocky crag.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">From there he spies out food; his eyes see it from afar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">His young ones feast on blood; and where the slain are, there he is.”</p>
