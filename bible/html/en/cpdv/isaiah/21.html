<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="21" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The burden of the desert of the sea. Just as the whirlwinds approach from Africa, it approaches from the desert, from a terrible land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A difficult vision has been announced to me: he who is unbelieving, he acts unfaithfully, and he who is a plunderer, he devastates. Ascend, O Elam! Lay siege, O Media! I have caused all its mourning to cease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Because of this, my lower back has been filled with pain, and anguish has possessed me, like the anguish of a woman in labor. I fell down when I heard it. I was disturbed when I saw it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">My heart withered. The darkness stupefied me. Babylon, my beloved, has become a wonder to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Prepare the table. Contemplate, from a place of observation, those who eat and drink. Rise up, you leaders! Take up the shield!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For the Lord has said this to me: “Go and station a watchman. And let him announce whatever he will see.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And he saw a chariot with two horsemen, and a rider on an donkey, and a rider on a camel. And he considered them diligently, with an intense gaze.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And a lion cried out: “I am on the watchtower of the Lord, standing continually by day. And I am at my station, standing throughout the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Behold, a certain man approaches, a man riding on a two-horse chariot.” And he responded, and he said: “Fallen, fallen is Babylon! And all its graven gods have been crushed into the earth!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">O my threshed grain! O sons of my threshing floor! What I have heard from the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, I have announced to you.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The burden of Dumah, cried out to me from Seir: “Watchman, how goes the night? Watchman, how goes the night?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The watchman said: “Morning approaches with the night. If you are seeking: seek, and convert, and approach.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The burden in Arabia. In the forest you shall sleep, in the evening on the paths of Dedanim.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">You who inhabit the land of the south: upon meeting the thirsty, bring water; meet the fugitive with bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For they are fleeing before the face of swords, before the face of a sword hanging over them, before the face of a bent bow, before the face of a grievous battle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For the Lord said this to me: “After one more year, just like one year for a hired hand, all the glory of Kedar will be taken away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the remainder of the multitude of strong archers from the sons of Kedar will be few, for the Lord, the God of Israel, has spoken it.”</p>
