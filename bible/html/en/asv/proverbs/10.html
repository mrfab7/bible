<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father; But a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Treasures of wickedness profit nothing; But righteousness delivereth from death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Jehovah will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish; But he thrusteth away the desire of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He becometh poor that worketh with a slack hand; But the hand of the diligent maketh rich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He that gathereth in summer is a wise son; But he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Blessings are upon the head of the righteous; But violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The memory of the righteous is blessed; But the name of the wicked shall rot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The wise in heart will receive commandments; But a prating fool shall fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He that walketh uprightly walketh surely; But he that perverteth his ways shall be known.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow; But a prating fool shall fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life; But violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Hatred stirreth up strifes; But love covereth all transgressions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">In the lips of him that hath discernment wisdom is found; But a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Wise men lay up knowledge; But the mouth of the foolish is a present destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The rich manâ€™s wealth is his strong city: The destruction of the poor is their poverty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The labor of the righteous tendeth to life; The increase of the wicked, to sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He is in the way of life that heedeth correction; But he that forsaketh reproof erreth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He that hideth hatred is of lying lips; And he that uttereth a slander is a fool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">In the multitude of words there wanteth not transgression; But he that refraineth his lips doeth wisely.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The tongue of the righteous is as choice silver: The heart of the wicked is little worth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The lips of the righteous feed many; But the foolish die for lack of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The blessing of Jehovah, it maketh rich; And he addeth no sorrow therewith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">It is as sport to a fool to do wickedness; And so is wisdom to a man of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him; And the desire of the righteous shall be granted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">When the whirlwind passeth, the wicked is no more; But the righteous is an everlasting foundation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, So is the sluggard to them that send him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The fear of Jehovah prolongeth days; But the years of the wicked shall be shortened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The hope of the righteous shall be gladness; But the expectation of the wicked shall perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">The way of Jehovah is a stronghold to the upright; But it is a destruction to the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The righteous shall never be removed; But the wicked shall not dwell in the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The mouth of the righteous bringeth forth wisdom; But the perverse tongue shall be cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable; But the mouth of the wicked speaketh perverseness.</p>
