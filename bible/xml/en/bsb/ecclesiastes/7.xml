<chapter book="Ecclesiastes" number="7" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">A good name is better than fine perfume, and one’s day of death is better than his day of birth.</verse>
  <verse number="2">It is better to enter a house of mourning than a house of feasting, since death is the end of every man, and the living should take this to heart.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Sorrow is better than laughter, for a sad countenance is good for the heart.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.</verse>
  <verse number="5">It is better to heed a wise man’s rebuke than to listen to the song of fools.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For like the crackling of thorns under the pot, so is the laughter of the fool. This too is futile.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Surely extortion turns a wise man into a fool, and a bribe corrupts the heart.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The end of a matter is better than the beginning, and a patient spirit is better than a proud one.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger settles in the lap of a fool.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Do not say, “Why were the old days better than these?” For it is unwise of you to ask about this.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Wisdom, like an inheritance, is good, and it benefits those who see the sun.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For wisdom, like money, is a shelter, and the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves the life of its owner.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Consider the work of God: Who can straighten what He has bent?</verse>
  <verse number="14">In the day of prosperity, be joyful, but in the day of adversity, consider this: God has made one of these along with the other, so that a man cannot discover anything that will come after him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">In my futile life I have seen both of these: A righteous man perishing in his righteousness, and a wicked man living long in his wickedness.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Do not be overly righteous, and do not make yourself too wise. Why should you destroy yourself?</verse>
  <verse number="17">Do not be excessively wicked, and do not be a fool. Why should you die before your time?</verse>
  <verse number="18">It is good to grasp the one and not let the other slip from your hand. For he who fears God will follow both warnings.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Wisdom makes the wise man stronger than ten rulers in a city.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Surely there is no righteous man on earth who does good and never sins.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Do not pay attention to every word that is spoken, or you may hear your servant cursing you.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others.</verse>
  <verse number="23">All this I tested by wisdom, saying, “I resolve to be wise.” But it was beyond me.</verse>
  <verse number="24">What exists is out of reach and very deep. Who can fathom it?</verse>
  <verse number="25">I directed my mind to understand, to explore, to search out wisdom and explanations, and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the folly of madness.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And I find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare, whose heart is a net, and whose hands are chains. The man who pleases God escapes her, but the sinner is ensnared.</verse>
  <verse number="27">“Behold,” says the Teacher, “I have discovered this by adding one thing to another to find an explanation.</verse>
  <verse number="28">While my soul was still searching but not finding, among a thousand I have found one upright man, but among all these I have not found one such woman.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Only this have I found: I have discovered that God made mankind upright, but they have sought out many schemes.”</verse>
