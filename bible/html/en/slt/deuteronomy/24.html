<p class="verse" data-verse="1">When a man shall take a wife and he married her, and it was if she shall find not favor in his eyes because he found in her a nakedness of the word: and he wrote for her a writing of cutting off, and gave in her hand, and sent her away from his house.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Her first husband who sent her away shall not be able to turn back to take her to be to him for a wife after that she was defiled; for it is an abomination before Jehovah: and thou shalt not cause the land to sin which Jehovah thy God gave to thee an inheritance.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And if the man be poor, he shall not sleep with his pledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Turning back, thou shalt turn back to him the pledge as the sun went down; he lay down in his garment and blessed thee; and to thee shall be justice before Jehovah thy God.</p>
