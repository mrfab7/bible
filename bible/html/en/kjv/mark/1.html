<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea, and they of Jerusalem, and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And John was clothed with camel’s hair, and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he did eat locusts and wild honey;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And preached, saying, There cometh one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I indeed have baptized you with water: but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And straightway coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And there came a voice from heaven, [saying], Thou art my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And immediately the Spirit driveth him into the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And he was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan; and was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Now after that John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Jesus said unto them, Come ye after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And straightway they forsook their nets, and followed him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And when he had gone a little further thence, he saw James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And straightway he called them: and they left their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, and went after him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And they went into Capernaum; and straightway on the sabbath day he entered into the synagogue, and taught.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And they were astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one that had authority, and not as the scribes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Saying, Let [us] alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? what new doctrine [is] this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">But Simon’s wife’s mother lay sick of a fever, and anon they tell him of her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And he came and took her by the hand, and lifted her up; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And at even, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all that were diseased, and them that were possessed with devils.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And all the city was gathered together at the door.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And he healed many that were sick of divers diseases, and cast out many devils; and suffered not the devils to speak, because they knew him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And Simon and they that were with him followed after him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And when they had found him, they said unto him, All [men] seek for thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns, that I may preach there also: for therefore came I forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and cast out devils.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down to him, and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And Jesus, moved with compassion, put forth [his] hand, and touched him, and saith unto him, I will; be thou clean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was cleansed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And he straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And saith unto him, See thou say nothing to any man: but go thy way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">But he went out, and began to publish [it] much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.</p>
