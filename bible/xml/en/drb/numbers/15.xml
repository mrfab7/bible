  <verse number="1">And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Speak to the children of Israel and thou shalt say to them: When you shall be come into the land of your habitation, which I will give you,</verse>
  <verse number="3">And shall make an offering to the Lord, for a holocaust, or a victim, paying your vows, or voluntarily offering gifts, or in your solemnities burning a sweet savour unto the Lord, of oxen or of sheep:</verse>
  <verse number="4">Whosoever immolateth the victim, shall offer a sacrifice of fine flour, the tenth part of an ephi, tempered with the fourth part of a hin of oil:</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he shall give the same measure of wine to pour out in libations for the holocaust or for the victim. For every lamb,</verse>
  <verse number="6">And for every ram there shall be a sacrifice of hour of two tenths, which shall be tempered with the third part of a hin of oil:</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he shall offer the third part of the same measure of wine for the libation, for a sweet savour to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But when thou offerest a holocaust or sacrifice of oxen, to fulfil thy vow or for victims of peace offerings,</verse>
  <verse number="9">Thou shalt give for every ox three tenths of flour tempered with half a hin of oil,</verse>
  <verse number="10">And wine for libations of the same measure, for an offering of most sweet savour to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Thus shalt thou do</verse>
  <verse number="12">For every ox and ram and lamb and kid.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Both they that are born in the land, and the strangers</verse>
  <verse number="14">Shall offer sacrifices after the same rite.</verse>
  <verse number="15">There shall be all one law and judgment both for you and for them who are strangers in the land.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="17">Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them:</verse>
  <verse number="18">When you are come into the land which I will give you,</verse>
  <verse number="19">And shall eat of the bread of that country, you shall separate firstfruits to the Lord,</verse>
  <verse number="20">Of the things you eat. As you separate firstfruits of your barnfloors:</verse>
  <verse number="21">So also shall you give firstfruits of your dough to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And if through ignorance you omit any of these things, which the Lord hath spoken to Moses,</verse>
  <verse number="23">And by him hath commanded you, from the day that he began to command and thenceforward,</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the multitude have forgotten to do it: they shall offer a calf out of the herd, a holocaust for a most sweet savour to the Lord, and the sacrifice and libations thereof, as the ceremonies require, and a buck goat for sin:</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the priest shall pray for all the multitude of the children of Israel: and it shall be forgiven them, because they sinned ignorantly, offering notwithstanding a burnt offering to the Lord for themselves and for their sin and their ignorance:</verse>
  <verse number="26">And it shall be forgiven all the people of the children of Israel: and the strangers that sojourn among them: because it is the fault of all the people through ignorance.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But if one soul shall sin ignorantly, he shall offer a she goat of a year old for his sin.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the priest shall pray for him, because he sinned ignorantly before the Lord: and he shall obtain his pardon, and it shall be forgiven him.</verse>
  <verse number="29">The same law shall be for all that sin by ignorance, whether they be natives or strangers.</verse>
  <verse number="30">But the soul that committeth any thing through pride, whether he be born in the land or a stranger (because he hath been rebellious against the Lord) shall be cut off from among his people:</verse>
  <verse number="31">For he hath contemned the word the Lord, and made void his precept: therefore shall he be destroyed, and shall bear his iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And it came to pass, when the children of Israel were in the wilderness, and had found a man gathering sticks on the sabbath day,</verse>
  <verse number="33">That they brought him to Moses and Aaron and the whole multitude.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And they put him into prison, not knowing what they should do with him.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the Lord said to Moses: Let that man die, let all the multitude stone him without the camp.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And when they had brought him out, they stoned him, and he died as the Lord had commanded.</verse>
  <verse number="37">The Lord also said to Moses:</verse>
  <verse number="38">Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt tell them to make to themselves fringes in the corners of their garments, putting in them ribands of blue:</verse>
  <verse number="39">That when they shall see them, they may remember all the commandments of the Lord, and not follow their own thoughts and eyes going astray after divers things,</verse>
  <verse number="40">But rather being mindful of the precepts of the Lord, may do them and be holy to their God.</verse>
  <verse number="41">I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, that I might be your God.</verse>
