1	Wo! to those living at ease in Zion, and trusting in the mountain of Shomeron, being distinguished the chief of the nations, and to them the house of Israel came.
2	Pass through Calneh, and see; and go ye from thence to Hamath the great: and go down to the wine-press of the rovers: are they good above these kingdoms? or their bound great above your bound?
3	Extending to the evil day, and ye will bring near the seat of violence;
4	Lying upon beds of ivory, and stretching out upon their couches, and eating the lambs from the flock, and the calves from the midst of the stall.
5	Prating upon the mouth of the lyre, as David they invented to them instruments of music;
6	Drinking wine in vases, and they will anoint with the chief of ointments: and they were not grieved for the breaking of Joseph.
7	For this now shall they be carried away captive with the head of those carried away captive, and the shouting a those poured forth was removed.
8	The Lord Jehovah sware by his soul, says Jehovah God of armies: I abhor the pride of Jacob and I hated his palaces: and I delivered up the city and its fulness.
9	And it was if there shall remain ten men in one house, and they died.
10	And his friend lifted him up, and he burning him, and bringing forth the bones out of the house, and he said to him by the sides of the house: Yet with thee? And he said, No more. And he said, Silence: for not to make mention of the name of Jehovah.
11	For behold, Jehovah commands, and he struck the great house with breaches, and the small house with clefts.
12	Shall horses run upon the rock? will he plough with oxen? for ye turned judgment to poison and the fruit of justice to wormwood.
13	Rejoicing to no word, saying, Did we not take horns by our strength?
14	For behold, I raise up against you, O house of Israel, says Jehovah God of armies, a nation; and they pressed you from the entrance of Hamath, even to the torrent of the sterile region.
