<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who determined the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who stretched the line upon it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Whereupon were the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And prescribed for it my decree, and set bars and doors,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further; and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days began, and caused the dayspring to know its place;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">It is changed as clay under the seal; and all things stand forth as a garment:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm is broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the recesses of the deep?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Have the gates of death been revealed unto thee? or hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Hast thou comprehended the breadth of the earth? declare, if thou knowest it all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Where is the way to the dwelling of light, and as for darkness, where is the place thereof;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest discern the paths to the house thereof?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Doubtless, thou knowest, for thou wast then born, and the number of thy days is great!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Hast thou entered the treasuries of the snow, or hast thou seen the treasuries of the hail,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">By what way is the light parted, or the east wind scattered upon the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Who hath cleft a channel for the waterflood, or a way for the lightning of the thunder;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">To cause it to rain on a land where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">To satisfy the waste and desolate ground; and to cause the tender grass to spring forth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The waters are hidden as with stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Canst thou bind the cluster of the Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Canst thou lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season? or canst thou guide the Bear with her train?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Knowest thou the ordinances of the heavens? canst thou establish the dominion thereof in the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Canst thou send forth lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the mind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Who can number the clouds by wisdom? or who can pour out the bottles of heaven,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">When the dust runneth into a mass, and the clods cleave fast together?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lioness? or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Who provideth for the raven his food, when his young ones cry unto God, and wander for lack of meat?</p>
