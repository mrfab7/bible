<chapter book="1 Kings" number="5" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="3">You know how that David my father could not build an house to the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil result.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And, behold, I purpose to build an house to the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD spoke to David my father, saying, Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your room, he shall build an house to my name.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now therefore command you that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; and my servants shall be with your servants: and to you will I give hire for your servants according to all that you shall appoint: for you know that there is not among us any that can skill to hew timber like to the Sidonians.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which has given to David a wise son over this great people.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things which you sent to me for: and I will do all your desire concerning timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.</verse>
  <verse number="9">My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea: and I will convey them by sea in floats to the place that you shall appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and you shall receive them: and you shall accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.</verse>
  <verse number="10">So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy was thirty thousand men.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was over the levy.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Solomon had three score and ten thousand that bore burdens, and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;</verse>
  <verse number="16">Beside the chief of Solomon’s officers which were over the work, three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that worked in the work.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders did hew them, and the stone squarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.</verse>
