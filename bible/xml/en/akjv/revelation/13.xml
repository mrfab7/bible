<chapter book="Revelation" number="13" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And I stood on the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads the name of blasphemy.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the beast which I saw was like to a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they worshipped the dragon which gave power to the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like to the beast? who is able to make war with him?</verse>
  <verse number="5">And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given to him to continue forty and two months.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And it was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And all that dwell on the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="9">If any man have an ear, let him hear.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He that leads into captivity shall go into captivity: he that kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke as a dragon.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he excercises all the power of the first beast before him, and causes the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he does great wonders, so that he makes fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,</verse>
  <verse number="14">And deceives them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he had power to give life to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:</verse>
  <verse number="17">And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Here is wisdom. Let him that has understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred three score and six.</verse>
