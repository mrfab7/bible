<p class="verse" data-verse="1">For an object of desire he who is separated doth seek, With all wisdom he intermeddleth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A fool delighteth not in understanding, But—in uncovering his heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">With the coming of the wicked come also hath contempt, And with shame—reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Deep waters are the words of a man’s mouth, The fountain of wisdom is a flowing brook.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Acceptance of the face of the wicked is not good, To turn aside the righteous in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The lips of a fool enter into strife, And his mouth for stripes calleth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The mouth of a fool is ruin to him, And his lips are the snare of his soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The words of a tale-bearer are as self-inflicted wounds, And they have gone down to the inner parts of the heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He also that is remiss in his work, A brother he is to a destroyer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A tower of strength is the name of Jehovah, Into it the righteous runneth, and is set on high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The wealth of the rich is the city of his strength, And as a wall set on high in his own imagination.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Before destruction the heart of man is high, And before honour is humility.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whoso is answering a matter before he heareth, Folly it is to him and shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The spirit of a man sustaineth his sickness, And a smitten spirit who doth bear?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The heart of the intelligent getteth knowledge, And the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The gift of a man maketh room for him, And before the great it leadeth him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Righteous is the first in his own cause, His neighbour cometh and hath searched him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The lot causeth contentions to cease, And between the mighty it separateth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A brother transgressed against is as a strong city, And contentions as the bar of a palace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">From the fruit of a man’s mouth is his belly satisfied, From the increase of his lips he is satisfied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Death and life are in the power of the tongue, And those loving it eat its fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Whoso hath found a wife hath found good, And bringeth out good-will from Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">With supplications doth the poor speak, And the rich answereth fierce things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">A man with friends is to show himself friendly, And there is a lover adhering more than a brother!</p>
