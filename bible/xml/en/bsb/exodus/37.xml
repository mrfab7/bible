  <verse number="1">Bezalel went on to construct the ark of acacia wood, two and a half cubits long, a cubit and a half wide, and a cubit and a half high.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He overlaid it with pure gold, both inside and out, and made a gold molding around it.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he cast four gold rings for its four feet, two rings on one side and two on the other.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then he made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark in order to carry it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He constructed a mercy seat of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and a cubit and a half wide.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He made two cherubim of hammered gold at the ends of the mercy seat,</verse>
  <verse number="8">one cherub on one end and one on the other, all made from one piece of gold.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the cherubim had wings that spread upward, overshadowing the mercy seat. The cherubim faced each other, looking toward the mercy seat.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He also made the table of acacia wood two cubits long, a cubit wide, and a cubit and a half high.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He overlaid it with pure gold and made a gold molding around it.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he made a rim around it a handbreadth wide and put a gold molding on the rim.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He cast four gold rings for the table and fastened them to the four corners at its four legs.</verse>

  <verse number="17">Then he made the lampstand out of pure hammered gold, all of one piece: its base and shaft, its cups, and its buds and petals.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Six branches extended from the sides, three on one side and three on the other.</verse>
  <verse number="19">There were three cups shaped like almond blossoms on the first branch, each with buds and petals, three on the next branch, and the same for all six branches that extended from the lampstand.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And on the lampstand were four cups shaped like almond blossoms with buds and petals.</verse>
  <verse number="21">A bud was under the first pair of branches that extended from the lampstand, a bud under the second pair, and a bud under the third pair.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The buds and branches were all of one piece with the lampstand, hammered out of pure gold.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He also made its seven lamps, its wick trimmers, and trays of pure gold.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He made the lampstand and all its utensils from a talent of pure gold.</verse>

  <verse number="26">And he overlaid with pure gold the top and all the sides and horns. Then he made a molding of gold around it.</verse>
  <verse number="27">He made two gold rings below the molding on opposite sides to hold the poles used to carry it.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And he made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.</verse>
  <verse number="29">He also made the sacred anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense, the work of a perfumer.</verse>
