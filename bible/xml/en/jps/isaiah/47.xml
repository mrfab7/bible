  <verse number="1">Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, Sit on the ground without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans; For thou shalt no more be called Tender and delicate.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Take the millstones, and grind meal; Remove thy veil, Strip off the train, uncover the leg, Pass through the rivers.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, Yea, thy shame shall be seen; I will take vengeance, And will let no man intercede.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Our Redeemer, the LORD of hosts is His name, The Holy One of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; For thou shalt no more be called The mistress of kingdoms.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I was wroth with My people, I profaned Mine inheritance, And gave them into thy hand; Thou didst show them no mercy; Upon the aged hast thou very heavily Laid thy yoke.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And thou saidst: ‘For ever shall I be mistress’; So that thou didst not lay these things to thy heart, Neither didst remember the end thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now therefore hear this, thou that art given to pleasures, That sittest securely, That sayest in thy heart: ‘I am, and there is none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, Neither shall I know the loss of children’;</verse>
  <verse number="9">But these two things shall come to thee in a moment In one day, the loss of children, and widow-hood; In their full measure shall they come upon thee, For the multitude of thy sorceries, And the great abundance of thine enchantments.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And thou hast been secure in thy wickedness, Thou hast said: ‘None seeth me’; Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, It hath perverted thee; And thou hast said in thy heart. ‘I am, and there is none else beside me.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">Yet shall evil came upon thee; Thou shalt not know how to charm it away; And calamity shall fall upon thee; Thou shalt not be able to put it away; And ruin shall come upon thee suddenly, Before thou knowest.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Stand now with thine enchantments, And with the multitude of thy sorceries, Wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; If so be thou shalt be able to profit, If so be thou mayest prevail.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels; Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, The monthly prognosticators, Stand up, and save thee From the things that shall come upon thee.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Behold, they shall be as stubble; The fire shall burn them; They shall not deliver themselves From the power of the flame; It shall not be a coal to warm at, Nor a fire to sit before.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thus shall they be unto thee With whom thou hast laboured; They that have trafficked with thee from thy youth Shall wander every one to his quarter; There shall be none to save thee.</verse>
