  <verse number="1">And a man from the house of Levi will go and take a daughter of Levi.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the woman will conceive and will bring forth a son; and she will see him that he is good, and she will hide him three months.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And she will not be able any more to hide him, and she will take for him an ark of bulrush, and will pitch it with bitumen and with pitch, and she will put in it the child, and will put in the sedge by the lip of the river.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And his sister will stand afar off to know what will be done to him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the daughter of Pharaoh will come down to wash at the river; and her maids going by the side of the river: and she will see the ark in the midst of the sedge, and she will send her maid and she will take it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And she will open and will see the child: and behold, the boy weeping: And she will have pity upon him, and will say, This from the children of the Hebrews.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And his sister will say to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse from the Hebrew women, and she will suckle the child for thee?</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Pharaoh’s daughter will say to her, Go. And she will go and call the child’s mother.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Pharaoh’s daughter will say to her, Take this child and suckle it for me, and I will give thy wages And the woman will take the child and will suckle it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the child will become great, and she will bring him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he will be to her for a son. And she will call his name Moses; and she will say, Because I drew him out of the water.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it will be in these days, and Moses will become great, and he will go forth to his brethren, and he will see their burdens: and he will see a man, an Egyptian, smiting a man, a Hebrew, from his brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he will turn hither and thither, and will see that there is no man, and he will smite the Egyptian, and hide him in the sand.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he will go forth in the second day, and behold, two men, Hebrews, (paneling; and he will say to the unjust one, For what wilt thou smite thy friend?</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he will say, Who set thee for a chief man and judge over us? dost thou think to kill me as thou didst kill the Egyptian? and Moses will be afraid, and will say, Surely, this word was known.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Pharaoh will hear this word, and he will seek to kill Moses. And Moses will flee from the face of Pharaoh, and he will dwell in the land of Midian: and he will sit down by the well.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And to the priest of Midian, seven daughters: and they will come and will draw and fill the watering troughs to water the sheep of their father.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the shepherds will come, and will expel them: and Moses will rise up and help them, and will water their sheep.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And they will come to Reuel their father, and he will say, Wherefore hastened ye to come this day?</verse>
  <verse number="19">And they will say, A man, an Egyptian, delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and also drawing, drew for us, and watered the sleep.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he will say to his daughters, Where is he? for what this left ye the man? call to him and he shall eat bread.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Moses will be contented to dwell with the man, and he will give Zipporah his daughter to Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And she will bear a son, and he will call his name Gershom; for he said, I was a sojourner in a strange land.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And it will be in these many days, and the king of Egypt will die: and the sons of Israel will groan, from the work; and they will cry out, and their supplication will go up to God from the work.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And God will hear their groaning, and God will remember his covenant with Abraham, with Isaak and with Jacob.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And God will see the sons of Israel, and God will know.</verse>
