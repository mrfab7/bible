  <verse number="2">He did that which was right in the eyes of Yahweh, according to all that his father Uzziah had done: however he didn’t enter into the temple of Yahweh. The people still did corruptly.</verse>
  <verse number="3">He built the upper gate of the house of Yahweh, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Moreover he built cities in the hill country of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He fought also with the king of the children of Ammon, and prevailed against them.

The children of Ammon gave that much to him in the second year also, and in the third.</verse>
