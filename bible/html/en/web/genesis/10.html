<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Cush became the father of Nimrod. He began to be a mighty one in the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He was a mighty hunter before Yahweh. Therefore it is said, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before Yahweh.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Out of that land he went into Assyria, and built Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as you go toward Gerar, to Gaza; as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, to Lasha.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their languages, in their lands, in their nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">To Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, to him also were children born.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="25">To Eber were born two sons. The name of the one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided. His brother’s name was Joktan.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="32">These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations. Of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.</p>
