  <verse number="1">And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of them a staff, a staff for each father’s house, of all their princes according to the houses of their fathers, twelve staves: thou shalt write each one’s name upon his staff.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Aaron’s name shalt thou write upon the staff of Levi; for one staff shall be for [each] head of their fathers’ houses.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And thou shalt lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And it shall come to pass, that the man whom I shall choose, his staff shall bud forth; and I will make to cease from before me the murmurings of the children of Israel, that they murmur against you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and all their princes gave him a staff, one staff for each prince according to their fathers’ houses, twelve staves, and the staff of Aaron was among their staves.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Moses laid the staves before Jehovah in the tent of the testimony.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it came to pass, when on the morrow Moses went into the tent of the testimony, behold, the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi had budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and ripened almonds.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Moses brought out all the staves from before Jehovah to all the children of Israel, and they looked and took each one his staff.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Jehovah said to Moses, Bring Aaron’s staff again before the testimony, to be kept as a token for the sons of rebellion, that thou mayest put an end to their murmurings before me, that they may not die.</verse>

  <verse number="12">And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Lo, we expire, we perish, we all perish.</verse>
