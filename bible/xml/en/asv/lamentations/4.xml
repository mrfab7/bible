  <verse number="1">How is the gold become dim! how is the most pure gold changed! The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.</verse>
  <verse number="2">The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!</verse>
  <verse number="3">Even the jackals draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: The daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: The young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: They that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, That was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were laid upon her.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Her nobles were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk; They were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was as of sapphire.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: Their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.</verse>
  <verse number="9">They that are slain with the sword are better than they that are slain with hunger; For these pine away, stricken through, for want of the fruits of the field.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Jehovah hath accomplished his wrath, he hath poured out his fierce anger; And he hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath devoured the foundations thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="12">The kings of the earth believed not, neither all the inhabitants of the world, That the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="13">It is because of the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, That have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.</verse>
  <verse number="14">They wander as blind men in the streets, they are polluted with blood, So that men cannot touch their garments.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Depart ye, they cried unto them, Unclean! depart, depart, touch not! When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, They shall no more sojourn here.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The anger of Jehovah hath scattered them; he will no more regard them: They respected not the persons of the priests, they favored not the elders.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Our eyes do yet fail in looking for our vain help: In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.</verse>
  <verse number="18">They hunt our steps, so that we cannot go in our streets: Our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the heavens: They chased us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, was taken in their pits; Of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz: The cup shall pass through unto thee also; thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: He will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will uncover thy sins.</verse>
