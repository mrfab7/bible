  <verse number="1">And having looked up, he saw the rich casting their gifts into the royal treasury.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he also saw a certain poor widow casting there two small coins.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he said, Truly I say to you, that this poor widow has cast in more than all:</verse>
  <verse number="4">For all they, of that abounding to them, have cast in to the gifts of God: and she from her want cast in all the living which she had.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And certain speaking of the temple, that it has been arranged with beautiful stones and decorations, he said,</verse>
  <verse number="6">These which ye see, the days shall come, in which stone shall not be left upon stone, which shall not be loosened.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they asked him, saying, Teacher, when therefore shall these be and what the sign when these should be about to be.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he said, See ye, be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, That I am; and the time has drawn near: therefore go not after them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And when ye hear of wars and tumults, be not terrified: for these must first be; but the end not immediately.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then said he to them, Nation shall be raised up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom:</verse>
  <verse number="11">And great earthquakes in places, and famines, and scourges shall be; and terrific objects and great signs shall be from heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And before all these shall they cast their hands upon you, and drive out, delivering to assemblies, and prisons, being brought before kings and leaders for my name’s sake.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And it shall turn out to you for a testimony.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Set therefore in your hearts, not to practise beforehand to justify yourselves:</verse>
  <verse number="15">For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all they opposed to you shall not be able to contradict nor withstand.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And ye shall also be delivered up by parents, and brethren, and kinsmen, and friends; and they shall put of you to death.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And ye shall be hated by all for my name’s sake.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And there shall not a hair of your head perish.</verse>
  <verse number="19">In your patience possess ye your souls.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And when ye see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its devastation has drawn near.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Then let those in Judea flee to the mountain; and those in the midst of her withdraw; and let those in the countries not go into her.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For these are the days of vengeance, that all things having been written, should be completed.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And woe to them having in the womb, and to them giving suck, in those days! for there shall be great necessity upon the land, and anger upon this people.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And they shall fall by the mouth of the sword, and they shall be made captives in all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down by all the nations, till the times of the nations should be completed.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And signs shall be in the sun, and moon, and stars; and upon earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and commotion resounding.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Men losing breath for fear and expectation of things coming on the habitable globe: for the powers of the heavens shall be shaken.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with much power and glory.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And these things beginning to be, get out of danger, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draws near.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he spake to them a parable; See the fig tree, and all trees;</verse>
  <verse number="30">When they should already throw forth, seeing of yourselves ye know that summer is already near.</verse>
  <verse number="31">So also ye, when ye see these being, know that the kingdom of God is near.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Truly I say to you, That this generation should not pass away, even till all things should be.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Heaven and earth shall pass away: and my words shall not pass away.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And attend to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be loaded with dizziness, caused by excess, and drunkenness, and cares of life, and that day come upon you unexpectedly.</verse>
  <verse number="35">For as a snare shall it come upon all remaining upon the face of all, the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Watch therefore, in all time praying, that ye be deemed worthy to escape all these about to be, and to stand before the Son of man.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And the days he was teaching in the temple; and the nights, coming out, he lodged in the mount called of Olives.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And all the people arose early in the morning to him in the temple, to hear him.</verse>
