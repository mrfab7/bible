  <verse number="1">Then said Solomon, Jehovah said to dwell in thick clouds.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And I built a house of habitation for thee, and a foundation for thy dwelling forever.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the king will turn his face, and will bless all the convocation of Israel: and all the convocation of Israel stood.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he will say, Praised be Jehovah the God of Israel, who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and filled up with his hands, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="5">From the day, that I brought forth my people from the land of Egypt I chose not in a city from all the tribes of Israel to build a house for my name to be there; and I chose not in man to be leader over my people Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And I will choose in Jerusalem for my name to be there; and I will choose in David to be over my people Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And it will be with the heart of David my father to build a house to the name of Jehovah God of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Jehovah will say to David my father, Because it was with thy heart to build a house to my name, thou didst well that it was with thy heart.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But thou shalt not build the house; for thy son coming forth from thy loins, he shall build the house to my name.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Jehovah will raise up the word that he spake: and I shall rise up instead of David my father, and sit upon the throne of Israel according to the word of Jehovah; and I will build the house to the name of Jehovah God of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And there I will set the ark where is there the covenant of Jehovah which he cut out with the sons of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he will stand before the altar of Jehovah before all the convocation of Israel, and he will spread forth his hands:</verse>
  <verse number="13">For Solomon made a platform of brass, and he will give it in the midst of the terrace; five cubits its length, and five cubits its breadth, and three cubits its height: and he will stand upon it, and he will bend upon his knees before all the convocation of Israel, and he will spread forth his hands to the heavens,</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he will say, O Jehovah God of Israel, not as thee a God in the heavens and in the earth, watching the covenant and the mercy to thy servants going before thee with all their heart:</verse>
  <verse number="15">Who didst watch to thy servant David my father what thou spakest to him; and thou wilt speak with thy month, and with thy hand thou wilt fill up, as this day.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And now Jehovah God of Israel, watch to thy servant David my father what thou spakest to him, saying, A man shall not be cut off to thee from before me sitting upon the throne of Israel; only if thy sons shall watch their way to go in my law according as thou wentest before me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And slow, O Jehovah God of Israel, thy word shall be firm which thou didst speak to thy servant, to David.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For indeed will God dwell with man upon the earth? Behold, the heavens and the heavens of the heavens will not contain thee; much less this house which I built.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Turn to the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication, O Jehovah my God, to hear to the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prays before thee:</verse>
  <verse number="20">For thine eye to be opened to this house day and night, to the place which thou saidst to put thy name there, to hear to the prayer which thy servant shall pray to this place.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And hear to the supplications of thy servant, and thy people Israel, which they shall pray to this place: and thou wilt hear from the place of thy dwelling from the heavens; and thou heardest and forgave.</verse>
  <verse number="22">If a man shall sin against his neighbor, and he lifted up an oath upon him to cause him to swear, and the oath coming before thine altar in this house;</verse>
  <verse number="23">And wilt thou hear from the heavens, and do, and judge thy servants, to turn back to the unjust to give his way upon his head: and to justify the just one by giving to him according to his justice.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And if thy people Israel shall be smitten before the enemy because they will sin against thee: and they turned back and confessed thy name, and prayed and made supplication before thee in this house;</verse>
  <verse number="25">And thou wilt hear from the heavens, and forgive to the sin of thy people Israel, and turn them back to the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="26">In shutting up the heavens and there was no rain, because they sinned against thee; if they prayed to this place, and confessed thy name, they shall turn back from their sin when thou wilt humble them.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And wilt thou hear from the heavens and forgive to the sin of thy servants, and thy people Israel? For thou wilt teach them to the good way which they shall go in it; and give rain upon the land which thou gavest to thy people for inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="28">If famine shall be in the land, if there shall be death, blasting and yellowness, the locust, and if there shall be the devourer; if the enemy shall press upon him in the land of his gates; every stroke and every disease:</verse>
  <verse number="29">Every prayer, every supplication which shall be to every man, and to all thy people Israel, when each shall know his strobe and his griefs, and spreading forth his hands to this house;</verse>
  <verse number="30">And wilt thou hear from the heavens the place of thy dwelling, and forgive, and give to each according to his ways, winch thou wilt know his heart? for thou alone knewest the heart of the sons of men.</verse>
  <verse number="31">So that they shall fear thee to walk in thy ways all the days which they live upon the face of the land which thou gavest to our fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And also to the stranger which he is not from thy people Israel, and coming from a land far off for sake of thy great name, and thy strong hand, and thine arm stretched out; and they came and prayed to this house;</verse>
  <verse number="33">And wilt thou hear from the heavens from the place of thy dwelling, and do according to all the stranger shall call to thee? so that all thy people shall know that thy name was called upon this house that I built.</verse>
  <verse number="34">If thy people shall go forth to war against their enemies in the way which thou shalt send them, and they prayed to thee the way of this city which thou didst choose in it, and the house that I built to thy name;</verse>
  <verse number="35">And hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their supplication, and do their judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="36">If they shall sin against thee, (for no man which shall not sin) and thou wert angry with them, and gavest them before the face of the enemy, and they taking them captive carried them captive to a land afar off or near;</verse>
  <verse number="37">And they turned back to their heart in the land which they were carried away captive there, and they turned back and made supplication to thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We sinned, we were perverse, and we did evil;</verse>
  <verse number="38">And they turned back to thee with all their heart and with all their soul into the land of their captivity where they carried them away captive; and they prayed the way of their land which thou gavest to their fathers, and the city which thou choosest, and to the house that I built for thy name.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And thou heardest from the heavens from the place of thy dwelling, their prayer and their supplications; and do their judgment, and forgive to thy people who sinned against thee.</verse>
  <verse number="40">Now, my God, shall thine eyes now be opened and thine ears attending to the prayer of this place.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And now arise, O Jehovah God, to thy rest, thou, and the ark of thy strength: thy priests, O Jehovah God, shall be clothed with salvation, and thy merciful ones shall rejoice in good.</verse>
  <verse number="42">O Jehovah God, thou wilt not turn away the face of thy Messiah: remember for the mercies of David thy servant.</verse>
