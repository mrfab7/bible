  <verse number="1">Then the scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem come up to Jesus, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Why do thy disciples transgress what has been delivered by the ancients? for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But he answering said to them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God on account of your traditional teaching?</verse>
  <verse number="4">For God commanded saying, Honour father and mother; and, He that speaks ill of father or mother, let him die the death.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or mother, It is a gift, whatsoever [it be] by which [received] from me thou wouldest be profited:</verse>
  <verse number="6">and he shall in no wise honour his father or his mother; and ye have made void the commandment of God on account of your traditional teaching.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Hypocrites! well has Esaias prophesied about you, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="8">This people honour me with the lips, but their heart is far away from me;</verse>
  <verse number="9">but in vain do they worship me, teaching [as] teachings commandments of men.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And having called to [him] the crowd, he said to them, Hear and understand:</verse>
  <verse number="11">Not what enters into the mouth defiles the man; but what goes forth out of the mouth, this defiles the man.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Then his disciples, coming up, said to him, Dost thou know that the Pharisees, having heard this word, have been offended?</verse>
  <verse number="13">But he answering said, Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Leave them alone; they are blind leaders of blind: but if blind lead blind, both will fall into a ditch.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Peter answering said to him, Expound to us this parable.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But he said, Are ye also still without intelligence?</verse>
  <verse number="17">Do ye not yet apprehend, that everything that enters into the mouth finds its way into the belly, and is cast forth into the draught?</verse>
  <verse number="18">but the things which go forth out of the mouth come out of the heart, and those defile man.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnessings, blasphemies;</verse>
  <verse number="20">these are the things which defile man; but the eating with unwashen hands does not defile man.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Jesus, going forth from thence, went away into the parts of Tyre and Sidon;</verse>
  <verse number="22">and lo, a Canaanitish woman, coming out from those borders, cried [to him] saying, Have pity on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is miserably possessed by a demon.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came to [him] and asked him, saying, Dismiss her, for she cries after us.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But he answering said, I have not been sent save to the lost sheep of Israel’s house.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But she came and did him homage, saying, Lord, help me.</verse>
  <verse number="26">But he answering said, It is not well to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But she said, Yea, Lord; for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their masters.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then Jesus answering said to her, O woman, thy faith [is] great. Be it to thee as thou desirest. And her daughter was healed from that hour.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Jesus, going away from thence, came towards the sea of Galilee, and he went up into the mountain and sat down there;</verse>
  <verse number="30">and great crowds came to him, having with them lame, blind, dumb, crippled, and many others, and they cast them at his feet, and he healed them:</verse>
  <verse number="31">so that the crowds wondered, seeing dumb speaking, crippled sound, lame walking, and blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But Jesus, having called his disciples to [him], said, I have compassion on the crowd, because they have stayed with me already three days and they have not anything they can eat, and I would not send them away fasting lest they should faint on the way.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And his disciples say to him, Whence should we have so many loaves in [the] wilderness as to satisfy so great a crowd?</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Jesus says to them, How many loaves have ye? But they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And he commanded the crowds to lie down on the ground;</verse>
  <verse number="36">and having taken the seven loaves and the fishes, having given thanks, he broke [them] and gave [them] to his disciples, and the disciples to the crowd.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And all ate and were filled; and they took up what was over and above of the fragments seven baskets full;</verse>
  <verse number="38">but they that ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And, having dismissed the crowds, he went on board ship and came to the borders of Magadan.</verse>
