<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="41" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fishhook? Or press down his tongue with a cord?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Canst thou put a rope into his nose? Or pierce his jaw through with a hook?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Will he make many supplications unto thee? Or will he speak soft words unto thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Will he make a covenant with thee, That thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? Or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Will the bands of fishermen make traffic of him? Will they part him among the merchants?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons, Or his head with fish-spears?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Lay thy hand upon him; Remember the battle, and do so no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Behold, the hope of him is in vain: Will not one be cast down even at the sight of him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">None is so fierce that he dare stir him up; Who then is he that can stand before me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him? Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, Nor his mighty strength, nor his goodly frame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who can strip off his outer garment? Who shall come within his jaws?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Who can open the doors of his face? Round about his teeth is terror.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">His strong scales are his pride, Shut up together as with a close seal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">One is so near to another, That no air can come between them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">They are joined one to another; They stick together, so that they cannot be sundered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">His sneezings flash forth light, And his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Out of his mouth go burning torches, And sparks of fire leap forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Out of his nostrils a smoke goeth, As of a boiling pot and burning rushes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His breath kindleth coals, And a flame goeth forth from his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">In his neck abideth strength, And terror danceth before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The flakes of his flesh are joined together: They are firm upon him; they cannot be moved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">His heart is as firm as a stone; Yea, firm as the nether millstone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: By reason of consternation they are beside themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">If one lay at him with the sword, it cannot avail; Nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He counteth iron as straw, And brass as rotten wood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The arrow cannot make him flee: Sling-stones are turned with him into stubble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Clubs are counted as stubble: He laugheth at the rushing of the javelin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">His underparts are like sharp potsherds: He spreadeth as it were a threshing-wain upon the mire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: He maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He maketh a path to shine after him; One would think the deep to be hoary.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Upon earth there is not his like, That is made without fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">He beholdeth everything that is high: He is king over all the sons of pride.</p>
