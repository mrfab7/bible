<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Does a wise man answer with empty counsel or fill his belly with the hot east wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Should he argue with useless words or speeches that serve no purpose?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But you even undermine the fear of God and hinder meditation before Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For your iniquity instructs your mouth, and you choose the language of the crafty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Your own mouth, not mine, condemns you; your own lips testify against you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Were you the first man ever born? Were you brought forth before the hills?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Do you listen in on the council of God or limit wisdom to yourself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What do you know that we do not? What do you understand that is not clear to us?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Both the gray-haired and the aged are on our side—men much older than your father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Are the consolations of God not enough for you, even words spoken gently to you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Why has your heart carried you away, and why do your eyes flash,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">so that you turn your spirit against God and pour such words from your mouth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What is man, that he should be pure, or one born of woman, that he should be righteous?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">If God puts no trust in His holy ones, if even the heavens are not pure in His eyes,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">how much less man, who is vile and corrupt, who drinks injustice like water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Listen to me and I will inform you. I will describe what I have seen,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">what was declared by wise men and was not concealed from their fathers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">to whom alone the land was given when no foreigner passed among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A wicked man writhes in pain all his days; only a few years are reserved for the ruthless.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Sounds of terror fill his ears; in his prosperity the destroyer attacks him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He despairs of his return from darkness; he is marked for the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He wanders about as food for vultures; he knows the day of darkness is at hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Distress and anguish terrify him, overwhelming him like a king poised to attack.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For he has stretched out his hand against God and has vaunted himself against the Almighty,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">rushing headlong at Him with a thick, studded shield.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Though his face is covered with fat and his waistline bulges with flesh,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">he will dwell in ruined cities, in abandoned houses destined to become rubble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He will no longer be rich; his wealth will not endure. His possessions will not overspread the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He will not escape from the darkness; the flame will wither his shoots, and the breath of God’s mouth will carry him away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Let him not deceive himself with trust in emptiness, for emptiness will be his reward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">It will be paid in full before his time, and his branch will not flourish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">He will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes, like an olive tree that sheds its blossoms.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For the company of the godless will be barren, and fire will consume the tents of bribery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">They conceive trouble and give birth to evil; their womb is pregnant with deceit.”</p>
