  <verse number="2">And he will pray to Jehovah and say, Ah, now, O Jehovah, was not this my word while I was upon my land? For this I anticipated to flee to Tarshish, for I knew that thou art merciful and compassionate, slow to anger and of much kindness, and lamenting for evil.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And now, O Jehovah, take now my soul from me, for it is good for me to die rather than for me to live.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Jehovah will say, Didst thou well for thee to be angry?</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Jonah will go out of the city, and sit from the east to the city, and he make to him there a tent, and he will sit under it in the shadow, even till he shall see what will be upon the city.</verse>
