<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold which they refine;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Iron is taken out of the dust, and copper is molten out of the stone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">[Man] putteth an end to the darkness, and exploreth to the utmost limit, the stones of darkness and of the shadow of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He openeth a shaft far from the inhabitants [of the earth]: forgotten of the foot, they hang suspended; away below men they hover.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">As for the earth, out of it cometh bread, and underneath it is turned up as by fire;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The stones of it are the place of sapphires, and it hath dust of gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">It is a path no bird of prey knoweth, and the vulture’s eye hath not seen it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The proud beasts have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed over it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">[Man] putteth forth his hand upon the flinty rock, he overturneth the mountains by the root.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He cutteth out channels in the rocks, and his eye seeth every precious thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He bindeth the streams that they drip not, and what is hidden he bringeth forth to light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But wisdom, where shall it be found? and where is the place of understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Man knoweth not the value thereof; and it is not found in the land of the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The deep saith, It is not in me; and the sea saith, It is not with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Choice gold cannot be given for it, nor silver be weighed for its price.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">It is not set in the balance with gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, and the sapphire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Gold and glass cannot be compared to it, nor vessels of fine gold be its exchange.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Corals and crystal are no more remembered; yea, the acquisition of wisdom is above rubies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The topaz of Ethiopia shall not be compared to it, neither shall it be set in the balance with pure gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For it is hidden from the eyes of all living, and concealed from the fowl of the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Destruction and death say, We have heard its report with our ears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth its place:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For he looketh to the ends of the earth, he seeth under the whole heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">In making a weight for the wind, and meting out the waters by measure,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">In appointing a statute for the rain, and a way for the thunder’s flash:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Then did he see it, and declare it; he established it, yea, and searched it out;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And unto man he said, Lo, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.</p>
