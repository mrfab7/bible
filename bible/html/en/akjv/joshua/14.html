<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And these are the countries which the children of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but to the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part to the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then the children of Judah came to Joshua in Gilgal: and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said to him, You know the thing that the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning me and you in Kadeshbarnea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as it was in my heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Nevertheless my brothers that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land where on your feet have trodden shall be your inheritance, and your childrenâ€™s for ever, because you have wholly followed the LORD my God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And now, behold, the LORD has kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the LORD spoke this word to Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, see, I am this day fourscore and five years old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spoke in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakims were there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the LORD said.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Joshua blessed him, and gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite to this day, because that he wholly followed the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.</p>
