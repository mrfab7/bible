<chapter book="Proverbs" number="24" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Don’t be envious of evil men; neither desire to be with them:</verse>
  <verse number="2">for their hearts plot violence, and their lips talk about mischief.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Through wisdom a house is built; by understanding it is established;</verse>
  <verse number="4">by knowledge the rooms are filled with all rare and beautiful treasure.</verse>
  <verse number="5">A wise man has great power; and a knowledgeable man increases strength;</verse>
  <verse number="6">for by wise guidance you wage your war; and victory is in many advisors.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Wisdom is too high for a fool: he doesn’t open his mouth in the gate.</verse>
  <verse number="8">One who plots to do evil will be called a schemer.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The schemes of folly are sin. The mocker is detested by men.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If you falter in the time of trouble, your strength is small.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Rescue those who are being led away to death! Indeed, hold back those who are staggering to the slaughter!</verse>
  <verse number="12">If you say, “Behold, we didn’t know this;” doesn’t he who weighs the hearts consider it? He who keeps your soul, doesn’t he know it? Shall he not render to every man according to his work?</verse>
  <verse number="13">My son, eat honey, for it is good; the droppings of the honeycomb, which are sweet to your taste:</verse>
  <verse number="14">so you shall know wisdom to be to your soul; if you have found it, then there will be a reward, your hope will not be cut off.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Don’t lay in wait, wicked man, against the habitation of the righteous. Don’t destroy his resting place:</verse>
  <verse number="16">for a righteous man falls seven times, and rises up again; but the wicked are overthrown by calamity.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Don’t rejoice when your enemy falls. Don’t let your heart be glad when he is overthrown;</verse>
  <verse number="18">lest Yahweh see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Don’t fret yourself because of evildoers; neither be envious of the wicked:</verse>
  <verse number="20">for there will be no reward to the evil man; and the lamp of the wicked shall be snuffed out.</verse>
  <verse number="21">My son, fear Yahweh and the king. Don’t join those who are rebellious:</verse>
  <verse number="22">for their calamity will rise suddenly; the destruction from them both—who knows?</verse>
  <verse number="23">These also are sayings of the wise. To show partiality in judgment is not good.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He who says to the wicked, “You are righteous;” peoples shall curse him, and nations shall abhor him—</verse>
  <verse number="25">but it will go well with those who convict the guilty, and a rich blessing will come on them.</verse>
  <verse number="26">An honest answer is like a kiss on the lips.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Prepare your work outside, and get your fields ready. Afterwards, build your house.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Don’t be a witness against your neighbor without cause. Don’t deceive with your lips.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Don’t say, “I will do to him as he has done to me; I will render to the man according to his work.”</verse>
  <verse number="30">I went by the field of the sluggard, by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;</verse>
  <verse number="31">Behold, it was all grown over with thorns. Its surface was covered with nettles, and its stone wall was broken down.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Then I saw, and considered well. I saw, and received instruction:</verse>
  <verse number="33">a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep;</verse>
  <verse number="34">so your poverty will come as a robber, and your want as an armed man.</verse>
