<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thus speaketh the LORD, the God of Israel, saying: Write thee all the words that I have spoken unto thee in a book.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For, lo, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will turn the captivity of My people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD; and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And these are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For thus saith the LORD: We have heard a voice of trembling, Of fear, and not of peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child; Wherefore do I see every man With his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, And all faces are turned into paleness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Alas! for that day is great, So that none is like it; And it is a time of trouble unto Jacob, But out of it shall he be saved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And it shall come to pass in that day, Saith the LORD of hosts, That I will break his yoke from off thy neck, And will burst thy bands; And strangers shall no more make him their bondman;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But they shall serve the LORD their God, And David their king, Whom I will raise up unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore fear thou not, O Jacob My servant, saith the LORD; Neither be dismayed, O Israel; For, lo, I will save thee from afar, And thy seed from the land of their captivity; And Jacob shall again be quiet and at ease, And none shall make him afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee; For I will make a full end of all the nations whither I have scattered thee, But I will not make a full end of thee; For I will correct thee in measure, And will not utterly destroy thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For thus saith the LORD: Thy hurt is incurable, And thy wound is grievous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">None deemeth of thy wound that it may be bound up; Thou hast no healing medicines.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">All thy lovers have forgotten thee, They seek thee not; For I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, With the chastisement of a cruel one; For the greatness of thine iniquity, Because thy sins were increased.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Why criest thou for thy hurt, That thy pain is incurable? For the greatness of thine iniquity, because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured, And all thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity; And they that spoil thee shall be a spoil, And all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For I will restore health unto thee, And I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; Because they have called thee an outcast: ‘She is Zion, there is none that careth for her.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will turn the captivity of Jacob’s tents, And have compassion on his dwelling-places; And the city shall be builded upon her own mound, And the palace shall be inhabited upon its wonted place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving And the voice of them that make merry; And I will multiply them, and they shall not be diminished, I will also increase them, and they shall not dwindle away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Their children also shall be as aforetime, And their congregation shall be established before Me, And I will punish all that oppress them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And their prince shall be of themselves, And their ruler shall proceed from the midst of them; And I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach unto Me; For who is he that hath pledged his heart To approach unto Me? saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And ye shall be My people, and I will be your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Behold, a storm of the LORD is gone forth in fury, A sweeping storm; it shall whirl upon the head of the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, Until He have executed, and till He have performed The purposes of His heart; In the end of days ye shall consider it.</p>
