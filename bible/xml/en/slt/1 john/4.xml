<chapter book="1 John" number="4" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Dearly beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits if they are of God: for many false prophets have come out into the world.</verse>
  <verse number="2">In this ye know the spirit of God: Every spirit which acknowledges Jesus Christ having come in the flesh is of God:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And every spirit which acknowledges not Jesus Christ having come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that of antichrist which ye have heard comes; and now is already in the world.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Ye are of God, little children, and have conquered them: for greater is he in you, than he in the world.</verse>
  <verse number="5">They are of the world: for this they speak of the world, and the world hears them.</verse>
  <verse number="6">We are of God: he knowing God hears us; he is not of God who hears us not. By this we know the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Dearly beloved, we should love one another: for love is of God; and every one loving has been born of God, and knows God.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He not loving knows not God; for God is love.</verse>
  <verse number="9">In this was the love of God manifested in us, that God has sent his only born Son into the world, that we might live by him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">In this is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Dearly beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.</verse>
  <verse number="12">None has ever seen God. If we love one another, God remains in us, and his love is completed in us.</verse>
  <verse number="13">In this we know that we remain in him, and he in us, for he has given us of his Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his. Son a Saviour of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And we have known and have believed the love which God has in us. God is love; and he remaining in love remains in God, and God in him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">In this has love been completed with us, that we might have freedom of speech in the day of judgment: for as he is, so are we in this world.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Fear is not in love; but perfected love casts out fear: for fear has restraint. And he fearing has not been perfected in love.</verse>
  <verse number="19">We should love him, for he first loved us.</verse>
  <verse number="20">If any say, I love God, and hate his brother, he is a liar: for he not loving his brother whom he has seen, God whom he has not seen, how can he love?</verse>
  <verse number="21">And this command have we from him, That he loving God love his brother also.</verse>
