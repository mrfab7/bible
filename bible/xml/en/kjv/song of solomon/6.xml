  <verse number="3">I [am] my beloved’s, and my beloved [is] mine: he feedeth among the lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thou [art] beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as [an army] with banners.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair [is] as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Thy teeth [are] as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and [there is] not one barren among them.</verse>
