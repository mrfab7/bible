<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he prayed unto the LORD, and said: ‘I pray Thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in mine own country? Therefore I fled beforehand unto Tarshish; for I knew that Thou art a gracious God, and compassionate, long-suffering, and abundant in mercy, and repentest Thee of the evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech Thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the LORD said: ‘Art thou greatly angry?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his evil. So Jonah was exceeding glad because of the gourd.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd, that it withered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and requested for himself that he might die, and said: ‘It is better for me to die than to live.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And God said to Jonah: ‘Art thou greatly angry for the gourd?’ And he said: ‘I am greatly angry, even unto death.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the LORD said: ‘Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow, which came up in a night, and perished in a night;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and should not I have pity on Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and also much cattle?’</p>
