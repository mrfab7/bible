<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A maul is come up before thy face; Guard the defences, Watch the way, make thy loins strong, Fortify thy power mightily!—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For the LORD restoreth the pride of Jacob, As the pride of Israel; For the emptiers have emptied them out, And marred their vine-branches.—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The shield of his mighty men is made red, The valiant men are in scarlet; The chariots are fire of steel in the day of his preparation, And the cypress spears are made to quiver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The chariots rush madly in the streets, They jostle one against another in the broad places; The appearance of them is like torches, They run to and fro like the lightnings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He bethinketh himself of his worthies; They stumble in their march; They make haste to the wall thereof, And the mantelet is prepared.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The gates of the rivers are opened, And the palace is dissolved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the queen is uncovered, she is carried away, And her handmaids moan as with the voice of doves, Tabering upon their breasts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But Nineveh hath been from of old like a pool of water; Yet they flee away; ‘Stand, stand’; But none looketh back.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold; For there is no end of the store, Rich with all precious vessels.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">She is empty, and void, and waste; And the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, And convulsion is in all loins, And the faces of them all have gathered blackness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Where is the den of the lions, Which was the feeding-place of the young lions, Where the lion and the lioness walked, and the lion’s whelp, And none made them afraid?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, And strangled for his lionesses, And filled his caves with prey, And his dens with ravin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, And I will burn her chariots in the smoke, And the sword shall devour thy young lions; And I will cut off thy prey from the earth, And the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.</p>
