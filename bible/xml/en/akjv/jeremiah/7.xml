<chapter book="Jeremiah" number="7" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Stand in the gate of the LORD’s house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all you of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Trust you not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are these.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For if you thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if you thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbor;</verse>
  <verse number="6">If you oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt:</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Behold, you trust in lying words, that cannot profit.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Will you steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods whom you know not;</verse>
  <verse number="10">And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, said the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But go you now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And now, because you have done all these works, said the LORD, and I spoke to you, rising up early and speaking, but you heard not; and I called you, but you answered not;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Therefore will I do to this house, which is called by my name, wherein you trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brothers, even the whole seed of Ephraim.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore pray not you for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear you.</verse>
  <verse number="17">See you not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?</verse>
  <verse number="18">The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Do they provoke me to anger? said the LORD: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, my anger and my fury shall be poured out on this place, on man, and on beast, and on the trees of the field, and on the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings to your sacrifices, and eat flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For I spoke not to your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:</verse>
  <verse number="23">But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people: and walk you in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well to you.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But they listened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt to this day I have even sent to you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them:</verse>
  <verse number="26">Yet they listened not to me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Therefore you shall speak all these words to them; but they will not listen to you: you shall also call to them; but they will not answer you.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But you shall say to them, This is a nation that obeys not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receives correction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Cut off your hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD has rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, said the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And the carcasses of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate.</verse>
