  <verse number="1">Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</verse>
  <verse number="2">In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity,</verse>
  <verse number="3">the word of the LORD came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire infolding itself, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides: and they four had their faces and their wings thus;</verse>
  <verse number="9">their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</verse>
  <verse number="10">As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And their faces and their wings were separate above; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they went every one straight forward: whither the spirit was to go, they went; they turned not when they went.</verse>
  <verse number="13">As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches; it went up and down among the living creatures: and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.</verse>
  <verse number="17">When they went, they went upon their four sides: they turned not when they went.</verse>
  <verse number="18">As for their rings, they were high and dreadful; and they four had their rings full of eyes round about.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went; thither was the spirit to go: and the wheels were lifted up beside them; for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</verse>
  <verse number="21">When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament, like the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered on this side, and every one had two which covered on that side, their bodies.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads: when they stood, they let down their wings.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward; and from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him.</verse>
  <verse number="28">As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.</verse>
