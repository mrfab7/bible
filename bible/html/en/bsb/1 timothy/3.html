<p class="verse" data-verse="1">This is a trustworthy saying: If anyone aspires to be an overseer, he desires a noble task.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">An overseer, then, must be above reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">not dependent on wine, not violent but gentle, peaceable, and free of the love of money.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">An overseer must manage his own household well and keep his children under control, with complete dignity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how can he care for the church of God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same condemnation as the devil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Furthermore, he must have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the snare of the devil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued or given to much wine or greedy for money.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They must hold to the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Additionally, they must first be tested. Then, if they are above reproach, let them serve as deacons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">In the same way, the women must be dignified, not slanderers, but temperate and faithful in all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A deacon must be the husband of but one wife, a good manager of his children and of his own household.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For those who have served well as deacons acquire for themselves a high standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these things</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">in case I am delayed, so that you will know how each one must conduct himself in Godâ€™s household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">By common confession, the mystery of godliness is great: He appeared in the flesh, was vindicated by the Spirit, was seen by angels, was proclaimed among the nations, was believed in throughout the world, was taken up in glory.</p>
