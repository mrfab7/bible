<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of [the] heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">who is faithful to him that has constituted him, as Moses also in all his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For he has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by how much he that has built it has more honour than the house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For every house is built by some one; but he who has built all things [is] God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Moses indeed [was] faithful in all his house, as a ministering servant, for a testimony of the things to be spoken after;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">but Christ, as Son over his house, whose house are we, if indeed we hold fast the boldness and the boast of hope firm to the end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wherefore, even as says the Holy Spirit, To-day if ye will hear his voice,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">where your fathers tempted [me], by proving [me], and saw my works forty years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Wherefore I was wroth with this generation, and said, They always err in heart; and they have not known my ways;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">so I swore in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">See, brethren, lest there be in any one of you a wicked heart of unbelief, in turning away from [the] living God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But encourage yourselves each day, as long as it is called To-day, that none of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For we are become companions of the Christ if indeed we hold the beginning of the assurance firm to the end;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">in that it is said, To-day if ye will hear his voice, do not harden your hearts, as in the provocation;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">(for who was it, who, having heard, provoked? but [was it] not all who came out of Egypt by Moses?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And with whom was he wroth forty years? [Was it] not with those who had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to those who had not hearkened to the word?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And we see that they could not enter in on account of unbelief;)</p>
