<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And David will go from thence to Mizpeh of Moab: and he will say to the king of Moab, My father will come forth now, and my mother with you, till I shall know what God will do to me.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the king will say to the runners standing by him, Turn about and kill the priests of Jehovah, for their hand also is with David, and because they knew when he fled, and did not uncover his ear.
