<chapter book="Romans" number="15" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">We who are strong ought to bear with the shortcomings of the weak and not to please ourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Each of us should please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For even Christ did not please Himself, but as it is written: “The insults of those who insult You have fallen on Me.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">For everything that was written in the past was written for our instruction, so that through endurance and the encouragement of the Scriptures, we might have hope.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now may the God who gives endurance and encouragement grant you harmony with one another in Christ Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="6">so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Accept one another, then, just as Christ accepted you, in order to bring glory to God.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of God’s truth, to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs,</verse>
  <verse number="9">so that the Gentiles may glorify God for His mercy. As it is written: “Therefore I will praise You among the Gentiles; I will sing hymns to Your name.”</verse>
  <verse number="10">Again, it says: “Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people.”</verse>
  <verse number="11">And again: “Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and extol Him, all you peoples.”</verse>
  <verse number="12">And once more, Isaiah says: “The Root of Jesse will appear, One who will arise to rule over the Gentiles; in Him the Gentiles will put their hope.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you believe in Him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I myself am convinced, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, brimming with knowledge, and able to instruct one another.</verse>
  <verse number="15">However, I have written you a bold reminder on some points, because of the grace God has given me</verse>
  <verse number="16">to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the Gentiles might become an offering acceptable to God, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Therefore I exult in Christ Jesus in my service to God.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I will not presume to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me in leading the Gentiles to obedience by word and deed,</verse>
  <verse number="19">by the power of signs and wonders, and by the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="20">In this way I have aspired to preach the gospel where Christ was not known, so that I would not be building on someone else’s foundation.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Rather, as it is written: “Those who were not told about Him will see, and those who have not heard will understand.”</verse>
  <verse number="22">That is why I have often been hindered from coming to you.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But now that there are no further opportunities for me in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to visit you,</verse>
  <verse number="24">I hope to see you on my way to Spain. And after I have enjoyed your company for a while, you can equip me for my journey.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Now, however, I am on my way to Jerusalem to serve the saints there.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For Macedonia and Achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="27">They were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual blessings, they are obligated to minister to them with material blessings.</verse>
  <verse number="28">So after I have completed this service and have safely delivered this bounty to them, I will set off to Spain by way of you.</verse>
  <verse number="29">I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Now I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to join me in my struggle by praying to God for me.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Pray that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints there,</verse>
  <verse number="32">so that by God’s will I may come to you with joy and together with you be refreshed.</verse>
  <verse number="33">The God of peace be with all of you. Amen.</verse>
