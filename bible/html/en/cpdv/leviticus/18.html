<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Speak to the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them: I am the Lord your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">You shall not act according to the custom of the land of Egypt, in which you have lived; nor shall you behave according to the habit of the region of Canaan, into which I will lead you; neither shall you walk in their ordinances.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">You shall accomplish my judgments, and you shall observe my precepts, and you shall walk in them. I am the Lord your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Keep my laws and judgments; when a man does these, he shall live by them. I am the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">No man shall approach her who is a close blood-relative to him, so as to uncover her nakedness. I am the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">You shall not expose the nakedness of your father, or the nakedness of your mother. She is your mother; you shall not uncover her nakedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">You shall not expose the nakedness of your father’s wife; for it is the nakedness of your father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">You shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister, whether from father or from mother, whether she was born at home or abroad.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">You shall not uncover the nakedness of your son’s daughter, or your daughter’s daughter; for it is your own nakedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife’s daughter, whom she bore to your father, and who is your sister.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">You shall not expose the nakedness of your father’s sister; for she is the flesh of your father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister, because she is the flesh of your mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s brother, nor shall you approach his wife, who is joined to you by affinity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law, for she is your son’s wife; neither shall you expose her dishonor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother’s wife; for it is the nakedness of your brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">You shall not uncover the nakedness of your wife and her daughter. You shall not take her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter, so as to uncover her dishonor; for they are her flesh, and such sexual intercourse is incest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">You shall not take your wife’s sister as a rival mistress; nor shall you uncover her nakedness, while your wife is still living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">You shall not approach a woman who is undergoing menstruation, nor shall you uncover her foulness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">You shall not have sexual intercourse with your neighbor’s wife, nor shall you be defiled by the mingling of seed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">You shall not give some of your seed to be consecrated to the idol Moloch, nor to pollute the name of your God. I am the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">You shall not commit sexual acts with a male, in place of sexual intercourse with a female, for this is an abomination.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">You shall not commit sexual acts with any animal, nor shall you be defiled by it. A woman shall not lie down with a beast, nor commit sexual acts with it; for this is wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Do not pollute yourselves with any of these things, by which all of the nations, which I will cast out in your sight, have been contaminated</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">and by which the land has been polluted. I will visit the wickedness of the land, so that it may vomit out its inhabitants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Keep my ordinances and judgments, and do not do any of these abominations: the native born, as well as the settler, who sojourns among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For all these detestable things were done by the inhabitants of the land who were here before you, and they have polluted it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Therefore, beware, lest in a similar manner, it may vomit you out as well, if you do these same things, just as it vomited out the people who were before you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Every soul who shall commit any of these abominations shall perish from the midst of his people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Keep my commandments. Do not be willing to do the things which have been done by those who were before you, and do not be polluted by these things. I am the Lord your God.</p>
