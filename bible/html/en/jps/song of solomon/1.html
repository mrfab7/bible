<p class="verse" data-verse="1">THE song of songs, which is Solomon’s.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth—For thy love is better than wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thine ointments have a goodly fragrance; Thy name is as ointment poured forth; Therefore do the maidens love thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Draw me, we will run after thee; The king hath brought me into his chambers; We will be glad and rejoice in thee, We will find thy love more fragrant than wine! Sincerely do they love thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, As the tents of Kedar, As the curtains of Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Look not upon me, that I am swarthy, That the sun hath tanned me; My mother’s sons were incensed against me, They made me keeper of the vineyards; But mine own vineyard have I not kept.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, Where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon; For why should I be as one that veileth herself Beside the flocks of thy companions?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, Go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock And feed thy kids, beside the shepherds’ tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I have compared thee, O my love, To a steed in Pharaoh’s chariots.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thy cheeks are comely with circlets, Thy neck with beads.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">We will make thee circlets of gold With studs of silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">While the king sat at his table, My spikenard sent forth its fragrance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">My beloved is unto me as a bag of myrrh, That lieth betwixt my breasts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">My beloved is unto me as a cluster of henna In the vineyards of En-gedi.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; Thine eyes are as doves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant; Also our couch is leafy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The beams of our houses are cedars, And our panels are cypresses.</p>
