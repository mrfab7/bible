  <verse number="1">And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? And he answering said to them, You say it.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answer you nothing? behold how many things they witness against you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marveled.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now at that feast he released to them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done to them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But Pilate answered them, saying, Will you that I release to you the King of the Jews?</verse>
  <verse number="10">For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Pilate answered and said again to them, What will you then that I shall do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?</verse>
  <verse number="13">And they cried out again, Crucify him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas to them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,</verse>
  <verse number="18">And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</verse>
  <verse number="19">And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit on him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots on them, what every man should take.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And the scripture was fulfilled, which said, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, you that destroy the temple, and build it in three days,</verse>
  <verse number="30">Save yourself, and come down from the cross.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?</verse>
  <verse number="35">And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calls Elias.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="40">There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</verse>
  <verse number="41">(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him;) and many other women which came up with him to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</verse>
  <verse number="43">Joseph of Arimathaea, an honorable counselor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly to Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And Pilate marveled if he were already dead: and calling to him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulcher which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone to the door of the sepulcher.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.</verse>
