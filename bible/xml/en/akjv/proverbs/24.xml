<chapter book="Proverbs" number="24" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Be not you envious against evil men, neither desire to be with them.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For their heart studies destruction, and their lips talk of mischief.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Through wisdom is an house built; and by understanding it is established:</verse>
  <verse number="4">And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.</verse>
  <verse number="5">A wise man is strong; yes, a man of knowledge increases strength.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For by wise counsel you shall make your war: and in multitude of counsellors there is safety.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Wisdom is too high for a fool: he opens not his mouth in the gate.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He that devises to do evil shall be called a mischievous person.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an abomination to men.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If you forbear to deliver them that are drawn to death, and those that are ready to be slain;</verse>
  <verse number="12">If you say, Behold, we knew it not; does not he that ponders the heart consider it? and he that keeps your soul, does not he know it? and shall not he render to every man according to his works?</verse>
  <verse number="13">My son, eat you honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to your taste:</verse>
  <verse number="14">So shall the knowledge of wisdom be to your soul: when you have found it, then there shall be a reward, and your expectation shall not be cut off.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; spoil not his resting place:</verse>
  <verse number="16">For a just man falls seven times, and rises up again: but the wicked shall fall into mischief.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Rejoice not when your enemy falls, and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles:</verse>
  <verse number="18">Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away his wrath from him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Fret not yourself because of evil men, neither be you envious at the wicked:</verse>
  <verse number="20">For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of the wicked shall be put out.</verse>
  <verse number="21">My son, fear you the LORD and the king: and meddle not with them that are given to change:</verse>
  <verse number="22">For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knows the ruin of them both?</verse>
  <verse number="23">These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He that said to the wicked, You are righteous; him shall the people curse, nations shall abhor him:</verse>
  <verse number="25">But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come on them.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Every man shall kiss his lips that gives a right answer.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Prepare your work without, and make it fit for yourself in the field; and afterwards build your house.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Be not a witness against your neighbor without cause; and deceive not with your lips.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Say not, I will do so to him as he has done to me: I will render to the man according to his work.</verse>
  <verse number="30">I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;</verse>
  <verse number="31">And, see, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was broken down.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked on it, and received instruction.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:</verse>
  <verse number="34">So shall your poverty come as one that travels; and your want as an armed man.</verse>
