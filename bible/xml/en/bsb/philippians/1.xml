  <verse number="1">Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus at Philippi, together with the overseers and deacons:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I thank my God every time I remember you.</verse>
  <verse number="4">In every prayer for all of you, I always pray with joy,</verse>
  <verse number="5">because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now,</verse>
  <verse number="6">being confident of this, that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="7">It is right for me to feel this way about all of you, since I have you in my heart. For in my chains and in my defense and confirmation of the gospel, you are all partners in grace with me.</verse>
  <verse number="8">God is my witness how I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And this is my prayer: that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight,</verse>
  <verse number="10">so that you may be able to test and prove what is best and may be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,</verse>
  <verse number="11">filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now I want you to know, brothers, that my circumstances have actually served to advance the gospel.</verse>
  <verse number="13">As a result, it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And most of the brothers, confident in the Lord by my chains, now dare more greatly to speak the word without fear.</verse>
  <verse number="15">It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The latter do so in love, knowing that I am appointed for the defense of the gospel.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The former, however, preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can add to the distress of my chains.</verse>
  <verse number="18">What then is the issue? Just this: that in every way, whether by false motives or true, Christ is preached. And in this I rejoice. Yes, and I will continue to rejoice,</verse>
  <verse number="19">because I know that through your prayers and the provision of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, my distress will turn out for my deliverance.</verse>
  <verse number="20">I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be ashamed, but will have complete boldness so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But if I go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me. So what shall I choose? I do not know.</verse>
  <verse number="23">I am torn between the two. I desire to depart and be with Christ, which is far better indeed.</verse>
  <verse number="24">But it is more necessary for you that I remain in the body.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,</verse>
  <verse number="26">so that through my coming to you again your exultation in Christ Jesus will resound on account of me.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Nevertheless, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in one spirit, contending together as one for the faith of the gospel,</verse>
  <verse number="28">without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you. This is a clear sign of their destruction but of your salvation, and it is from God.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For it has been granted to you on behalf of Christ not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for Him,</verse>
  <verse number="30">since you are encountering the same struggle you saw I had, and now hear that I still have.</verse>
