<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="1" translation="Webster Bible Translation" translationID="wbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all consolation.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them who are in any trouble by the consolation with which we ourselves are comforted by God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also aboundeth by Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And whether we are afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we are comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And our hope of you is steadfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For we would not, brethren, have you ignorant of our trouble which came to us in Asia, that we were pressed out of measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life:</verse>
  <verse number="9">But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raiseth the dead:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Who delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us:</verse>
  <verse number="11">Ye also helping together by prayer for us, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many on our behalf.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our manner of life in the world, and more abundantly toward you.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For we write no other things to you, than what ye read or acknowledge; and I trust ye will acknowledge even to the end;</verse>
  <verse number="14">As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And in this confidence I purposed to come to you before, that ye might have a second benefit;</verse>
  <verse number="16">And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again from Macedonia to you, and by you to be brought on my way towards Judea.</verse>
  <verse number="17">When I therefore was thus minded, did I use levity? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea, yea, and nay, nay?</verse>
  <verse number="18">But as God is true, our word towards you was not yea and nay.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me, and Silvanus, and Timothy, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, to the glory of God by us.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Now he who establisheth us with you in Christ, and hath anointed us, is God;</verse>
  <verse number="22">Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Moreover, I call God for a witness upon my soul, that to spare you I have not as yet come to Corinth.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy: for by faith ye stand.</verse>
