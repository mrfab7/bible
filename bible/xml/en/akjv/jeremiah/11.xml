  <verse number="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hear you the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;</verse>
  <verse number="3">And say you to them, Thus said the LORD God of Israel; Cursed be the man that obeys not the words of this covenant,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall you be my people, and I will be your God:</verse>
  <verse number="5">That I may perform the oath which I have sworn to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then the LORD said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear you the words of this covenant, and do them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring on them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do: but they did them not.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the LORD said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Therefore thus said the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil on them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry to me, I will not listen to them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry to the gods to whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For according to the number of your cities were your gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have you set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Therefore pray not you for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time that they cry to me for their trouble.</verse>
  <verse number="15">What has my beloved to do in my house, seeing she has worked lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from you? when you do evil, then you rejoice.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The LORD called your name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire on it, and the branches of it are broken.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For the LORD of hosts, that planted you, has pronounced evil against you, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense to Baal.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the LORD has given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then you showed me their doings.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But, O LORD of hosts, that judge righteously, that try the reins and the heart, let me see your vengeance on them: for to you have I revealed my cause.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Therefore thus said the LORD of the men of Anathoth, that seek your life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the LORD, that you die not by our hand:</verse>
  <verse number="22">Therefore thus said the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine:</verse>
  <verse number="23">And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.</verse>
