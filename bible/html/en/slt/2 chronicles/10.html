<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Rehoboam will go to Shechem: for to Shechem came all Israel to make him king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it will be as Jeroboam son of Nebat heard, and he in Egypt where he fled from the face of Solomon the king, and Jeroboam will turn back from Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they will send and call to him. And Jeroboam will come, and all Israel, and they will speak to Rehoboam, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thy father hardened our yoke: and now lighten from the hard servitude of thy father, and from his heavy yoke which he gave upon us, and we will serve thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And he will say to them, Yet three days and turn back to me. And the people will go.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And king Rehoboam will consult with the old men who were standing before Solomon his father in his being alive, saying, How counsel ye me to turn back word to this people?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And they will speak to him, saying, If thou wilt be for good to this people, and pleasing them, and speak to them good words, and they were servants to thee all the days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he will forsake the counsel of the old men which they counseled, and he will consult the children which grew up with him, standing before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he will say to them, What counsel ye? and we will turn back word to this people who spake to me, saying, Lighten from the yoke which thy father gave upon us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the children which grew up with him will speak with him, saying, Thou shalt say thus to the people who spake to thee, saying, Thy father made heavy our yoke, and lighten thou from us; thus shalt thou say to them, My little finger thick above my fatherâ€™s loins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And now my father loaded upon you a heavy yoke, and I will add upon your yoke: my father corrected you with whips, and I with scorpions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Jeroboam will come, and all the people, to Rehoboam, in the third day, as the king spake, saying, Turn back to me in the third day.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he will speak to them according to the counsel of the children, saying, My father made heavy your yoke, and I will add upon it: my father corrected you with whips, and I with scorpions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the king heard not to the people, for the turn was of God, so that Jehovah raised up his word which he spake by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And all Israel saw that the king heard not to them, and the people will turn back to the king, saying, What portion to us in David? And no inheritance in the son of Jesse: each to thy tents, O Israel: now see thy house, O David. And all Israel will go to his tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the sons of Israel dwelling in the cities of Judah, and Rehoboam will reign over them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And king Rehoboam will send Hadoram who was over the tribute; and the sons of Israel will stone upon him, and he will die. And king Rehoboam strengthened himself to go up into the chariot to flee to Jerusalem.</p>
