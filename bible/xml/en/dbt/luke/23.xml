  <verse number="1">And the whole multitude of them, rising up, led him to Pilate.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And they began to accuse him, saying, We have found this [man] perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ, a king.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Pilate demanded of him saying, Art thou the king of the Jews? And he answering him said, Thou sayest.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, I find no guilt in this man.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But they insisted, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee even on to here.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But Pilate, having heard Galilee [named], demanded if the man were a Galilaean;</verse>
  <verse number="7">and having learned that he was of Herod’s jurisdiction, remitted him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem in those days.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And when Herod saw Jesus he greatly rejoiced, for he had been a long while desirous of seeing him, because of hearing many things concerning him, and he hoped to see some sign done by him;</verse>
  <verse number="9">and he questioned him in many words, but he answered him nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the chief priests and the scribes stood and accused him violently.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Herod with his troops having set him at nought and mocked him, having put a splendid robe upon him, sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Pilate and Herod became friends with one another the same day, for they had been at enmity before between themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Pilate, having called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</verse>
  <verse number="14">said to them, Ye have brought to me this man as turning away the people [to rebellion], and behold, I, having examined him before you, have found nothing criminal in this man as to the things of which ye accuse him;</verse>
  <verse number="15">nor Herod either, for I remitted you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death is done by him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Having chastised him therefore, I will release him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">( Now he was obliged to release one for them at the feast.)</verse>
  <verse number="18">But they cried out in a mass saying, Away with this [man] and release Barabbas to us;</verse>
  <verse number="19">who was one who, for a certain tumult which had taken place in the city, and [for] murder, had been cast into prison.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Pilate therefore, desirous to release Jesus, again addressed [them].</verse>
  <verse number="21">But they cried out in reply saying, Crucify, crucify him.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he said the third time to them, What evil then has this [man] done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will chastise him therefore and release him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But they were urgent with loud voices, begging that he might be crucified. And their voices [and those of the chief priests] prevailed.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Pilate adjudged that what they begged should take place.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he released him who, for tumult and murder, had been cast into prison, whom they begged for, and Jesus he delivered up to their will.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And as they led him away, they laid hold on a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, and put the cross upon him to bear it behind Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And a great multitude of the people, and of women who wailed and lamented him, followed him.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Jesus turning round to them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep over me, but weep over yourselves and over your children;</verse>
  <verse number="29">for behold, days are coming in which they will say, Blessed [are] the barren, and wombs that have not borne, and breasts that have not given suck.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall upon us; and to the hills, Cover us:</verse>
  <verse number="31">for if these things are done in the green tree, what shall take place in the dry?</verse>
  <verse number="32">Now two others also, malefactors, were led with him to be put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And when they came to the place which is called Skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, the other on the left.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And, parting out his garments, they cast lots.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the people stood beholding, and the rulers also [with them] sneered, saying, He has saved others; let him save himself if this is the Christ, the chosen one of God.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And the soldiers also made game of him, coming up offering him vinegar,</verse>
  <verse number="37">and saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And there was also an inscription [written] over him in Greek, and Roman, and Hebrew letters: This is the King of the Jews.</verse>
  <verse number="39">Now one of the malefactors who had been hanged spoke insultingly to him, saying, Art not thou the Christ? save thyself and us.</verse>
  <verse number="40">But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost thou too not fear God, thou that art under the same judgment?</verse>
  <verse number="41">and we indeed justly, for we receive the just recompense of what we have done; but this [man] has done nothing amiss.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And he said to Jesus, Remember me, [Lord,] when thou comest in thy kingdom.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And it was about [the] sixth hour, and there came darkness over the whole land until [the] ninth hour.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple rent in the midst.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And Jesus, having cried with a loud voice, said, Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit. And having said this, he expired.</verse>
  <verse number="47">Now the centurion, seeing what took place, glorified God, saying, In very deed this man was just.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And all the crowds who had come together to that sight, having seen the things that took place, returned, beating [their] breasts.</verse>
  <verse number="49">And all those who knew him stood afar off, the women also who had followed him from Galilee, beholding these things.</verse>
  <verse number="50">And behold, a man named Joseph, who was a councillor, a good man and a just</verse>
  <verse number="51">(this [man] had not assented to their counsel and deed), of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who also waited, [himself also,] for the kingdom of God</verse>
  <verse number="52">—he having gone to Pilate begged the body of Jesus;</verse>
  <verse number="53">and having taken it down, wrapped it in fine linen and placed him in a tomb hewn in the rock, where no one had ever been laid.</verse>
  <verse number="54">And it was preparation day, and [the] sabbath twilight was coming on.</verse>
  <verse number="55">And women, who had come along with him out of Galilee, having followed, saw the sepulchre and how his body was placed.</verse>
  <verse number="56">And having returned they prepared aromatic spices and ointments, and remained quiet on the sabbath, according to the commandment.</verse>
