<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="9" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wisdom hath built herself a house, she hath hewn her out seven pillars.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">She hath slain her victims, mingled her wine, and set forth her table.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">She hath sent her maids to invite to the tower, and to the walls of the city:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Whosoever is a little one, let him come to me. And to the unwise she said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Come, eat my bread, and drink the wine which I have mingled for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Forsake childishness, and live, and walk by the ways of prudence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He that teacheth a scorner, doth an injury to himself: and he that rebuketh a wicked man, getteth himself a blot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Rebuke not a scorner lest he hate thee. Rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Give an occasion to a wise man, and wisdom shall be added to him. Teach a just man, and he shall make haste to receive it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is prudence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For by me shall thy days be multiplied, and years of life shall be added to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If thou be wise, thou shalt be so to thyself: and if a scorner, thou alone shalt bear the evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A foolish woman and clamorous, and full of allurements, and knowing nothing at all,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Sat at the door of her house, upon a seat, in a high place of the city,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">To call them that pass by the way, and go on their journey:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He that is a little one, let him turn to me. And to the fool she said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Stolen waters are sweeter, and hid den bread is more pleasant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he did not know that giants are there, and that her guests are in the depths of hell. The Parables of Solomon</p>
