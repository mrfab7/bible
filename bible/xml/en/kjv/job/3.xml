<chapter book="Job" number="3" translation="King James Bible" translationID="kjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Job spake, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="3">Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night [in which] it was said, There is a man child conceived.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</verse>
  <verse number="6">[As for] that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but [have] none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Because it shut not up the doors of my [mother’s] womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Why died I not from the womb? [why] did I [not] give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?</verse>
  <verse number="13">For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</verse>
  <verse number="14">With kings and counsellers of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;</verse>
  <verse number="15">Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</verse>
  <verse number="16">Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants [which] never saw light.</verse>
  <verse number="17">There the wicked cease [from] troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</verse>
  <verse number="18">[There] the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The small and great are there; and the servant [is] free from his master.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter [in] soul;</verse>
  <verse number="21">Which long for death, but it [cometh] not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</verse>
  <verse number="22">Which rejoice exceedingly, [and] are glad, when they can find the grave?</verse>
  <verse number="23">[Why is light given] to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</verse>
  <verse number="24">For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</verse>
  <verse number="26">I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</verse>
