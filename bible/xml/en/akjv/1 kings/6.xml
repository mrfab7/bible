  <verse number="1">And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length thereof was three score cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits, and the height thereof thirty cubits.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle: and he made chambers round about:</verse>
  <verse number="6">The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer nor ax nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in building.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and out of the middle into the third.</verse>
  <verse number="9">So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house with beams and boards of cedar.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="12">Concerning this house which you are in building, if you will walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with you, which I spoke to David your father:</verse>
  <verse number="13">And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="14">So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of cedar.</verse>
  <verse number="21">So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it with gold.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid with gold.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And within the oracle he made two cherubim of olive tree, each ten cubits high.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing to the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubim were of one measure and one size.</verse>
  <verse number="26">The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of the other cherub.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And he set the cherubim within the inner house: and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubim, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the middle of the house.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree: the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.</verse>
  <verse number="32">The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved on them carvings of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them with gold, and spread gold on the cherubim, and on the palm trees.</verse>
  <verse number="33">So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, a fourth part of the wall.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And he carved thereon cherubim and palm trees and open flowers: and covered them with gold fitted on the carved work.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and a row of cedar beams.</verse>
  <verse number="37">In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD laid, in the month Zif:</verse>
  <verse number="38">And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building it.</verse>
