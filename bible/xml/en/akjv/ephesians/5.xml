<chapter book="Ephesians" number="5" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Be you therefore followers of God, as dear children;</verse>
  <verse number="2">And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us, and has given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling smell.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;</verse>
  <verse number="4">Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For this you know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things comes the wrath of God on the children of disobedience.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Be not you therefore partakers with them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For you were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord: walk as children of light:</verse>
  <verse number="9">(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)</verse>
  <verse number="10">Proving what is acceptable to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatever does make manifest is light.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Why he said, Awake you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.</verse>
  <verse number="15">See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,</verse>
  <verse number="16">Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Why be you not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="19">Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</verse>
  <verse number="20">Giving thanks always for all things to God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="21">Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;</verse>
  <verse number="26">That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,</verse>
  <verse number="27">That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</verse>
  <verse number="28">So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, even as the Lord the church:</verse>
  <verse number="30">For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</verse>
  <verse number="31">For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="32">This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.</verse>
