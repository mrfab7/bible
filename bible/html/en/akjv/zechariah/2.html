<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I lifted up my eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Then said I, Where go you? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And said to him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For I, said the LORD, will be to her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the middle of her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, said the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, said the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Deliver yourself, O Zion, that dwell with the daughter of Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For thus said the LORD of hosts; After the glory has he sent me to the nations which spoiled you: for he that touches you touches the apple of his eye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For, behold, I will shake my hand on them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, see, I come, and I will dwell in the middle of you, said the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the middle of you, and you shall know that the LORD of hosts has sent me to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.</p>
