<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah: This day is a day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of reviling; for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">It may be Jehovah thy God will hear the words of Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to reproach the living God, and will rebuke the words which Jehovah thy God hath heard. Therefore lift up a prayer for the remnant that is left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith Jehovah: Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, I will put a spirit into him, and he shall hear tidings, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He has come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard [it], he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: Let not thy God, upon whom thou reliest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all countries, destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Have the gods of the nations which my fathers have destroyed delivered them, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden that were in Thelassar?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up into the house of Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, who sittest [between] the cherubim, thou, the Same, thou alone art the God of all the kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open, Jehovah, thine eyes, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to reproach the living God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the lands, and their countries,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; and they have destroyed them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And now, Jehovah our God, save us out of his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art Jehovah, thou only.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">this is the word which Jehovah hath spoken against him: The virgin-daughter of Zion despiseth thee, laugheth thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem shaketh her head at thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted the voice? Against the Holy One of Israel hast thou lifted up thine eyes on high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">By thy servants thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of the mountains, to the recesses of Lebanon; and I will cut down its tall cedars, the choice of its cypresses; and I will enter into its furthest height, [into] the forest of its fruitful field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">I have digged and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet have I dried up all the streams of Matsor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Hast thou not heard that long ago I did it, and that from ancient days I formed it? Now have I brought it to pass, that thou shouldest lay waste fortified cities [into] ruinous heaps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And their inhabitants were powerless, they were dismayed and put to shame; they were [as] the grass of the field and the green herb, [as] the grass on the housetops, and grain blighted before it be grown up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">But I know thine abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy raging against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Because thy raging against me and thine arrogance is come up into mine ears, I will put my ring in thy nose, and my bridle in thy lips, and I will make thee go back by the way by which thou camest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And this [shall be] the sign unto thee: there shall be eaten this year such as groweth of itself; and in the second year that which springeth of the same; but in the third year sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards and eat the fruit thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">for out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of mount Zion they that escape: the zeal of Jehovah of hosts shall do this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of Assyria: He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into this city, saith Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own sake, and for my servant David’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And an angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand. And when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead bodies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and returned, and abode at Nineveh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</p>
