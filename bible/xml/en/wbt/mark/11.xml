<chapter book="Mark" number="11" translation="Webster Bible Translation" translationID="wbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And when they came nigh to Jerusalem, to Bethphage, and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of his disciples,</verse>
  <verse number="2">And saith to them, Go into the village over against you: and as soon as ye have entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, on which never man sat; loose him, and bring him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And if any man shall say to you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord hath need of him; and immediately he will send him hither.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they went, and found the colt tied by the door without, in a place where two ways met; and they loose him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And certain of them that stood there, said to them, What do ye, loosing the colt?</verse>
  <verse number="6">And they said to them even as Jesus had commanded; and they let them go.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they brought the colt to Jesus, and cast their garments on him; and he sat upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And many spread their garments in the way: and others cut down branches off trees, and strewed them in the way.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they that went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Blessed be the kingdom of our Father David, that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Jesus entered into Jerusalem, and into the temple: and when he had looked round upon all things, it being now evening, he went out to Bethany, with the twelve.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And on the morrow, when they had come from Bethany, he was hungry,</verse>
  <verse number="13">And seeing a fig-tree afar off, having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing on it: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves: for the time of figs had not yet come.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Jesus answered and said to it, Let no man eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And they come to Jerusalem: and Jesus went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold doves;</verse>
  <verse number="16">And would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he taught, saying to them, Is it not written, My house shall be called by all nations the house of prayer? but ye have made it a den of thieves.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people were astonished at his doctrine.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And when evening had come, he went out of the city.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig-tree dried up from the roots.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Peter calling to remembrance, saith to him, Master, behold, the fig-tree which thou cursedst is withered.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Jesus answering, saith to them, Have faith in God.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For verily I say to you, that whoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that the things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatever he saith.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore I say to you, Whatever things ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall have them.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have aught against any: that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.</verse>
  <verse number="26">But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in heaven forgive your trespasses.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And they come again to Jerusalem: and as he was walking in the temple, there come to him the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders,</verse>
  <verse number="28">And say to him, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority to do these things?</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Jesus answered and said to them, I will also ask of you one question, and answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
  <verse number="30">The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men? answer me.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?</verse>
  <verse number="32">But if we shall say, from men; they feared the people: for all men counted John that he was a prophet indeed.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And they answered and said to Jesus, We cannot tell. And Jesus answering saith to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
