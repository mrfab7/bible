<div class="chapter" data-book="2 Corinthians" data-chapter="12" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in my infirmities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he sees me to be, or that he hears of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For this thing I sought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest on me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christâ€™s sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I am become a fool in glorying; you have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very most chief apostles, though I be nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For what is it wherein you were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent to you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Again, think you that we excuse ourselves to you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found to you such as you would not: lest there be debates, contentions, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, arrogance, tumults:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall mourn many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.</p>
