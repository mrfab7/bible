  <verse number="5">To whom will ye liken me and make me equal, or compare me, that we may be like?</verse>

  <verse number="7">They bear him on the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place; there he standeth, he doth not remove from his place: yea, one crieth unto him, and he answereth not; he saveth him not out of his trouble.</verse>

  <verse number="12">Hearken unto me, ye stout-hearted, that are far from righteousness:</verse>
  <verse number="13">I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not delay; and I will give salvation in Zion, [and] unto Israel my glory.</verse>
