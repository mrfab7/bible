<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="6" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But Job answered, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">O that my sins, whereby I have deserved wrath, and the calamity that I suffer, were weighed in a balance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">As the sand of the sea this would appear heavier: therefore my words are full of sorrow :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For the arrows of the Lord are in me, the rage whereof drinketh up my spirit, and the terrors of the Lord war against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Will the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or will the ox low when he standeth before a full manger?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Or can an unsavoury thing be eaten, that is not seasoned with salt? or can a man taste that which when tasted bringeth death?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The things which before my soul would not touch, now, through anguish are my meats.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Who will grant that my request may come: and that God may give me what I look for?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And that he that hath begun may destroy me, that he may let loose his hand, and cut me off?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And that this may be my comfort, that afflicting me with sorrow, he spare not, nor I contradict the words of the Holy One.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For what is my strength, that I can hold out? or what is my end that I should keep patience?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">My strength is not the strength of stones, nor is my flesh of brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Behold there is no help for me in myself, and my familiar friends also are departed from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He that taketh away mercy from his friend, forsaketh the fear of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">My brethren have passed by me, as the torrent that passeth swiftly in the valleys.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">They that fear the hoary frost, the snow shall fall upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">At the time when they shall be scattered they shall perish: and after it groweth hot they shall be melted out of their place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The paths of their steps are entangled: they shall walk in vain, and shall perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Consider the paths of Thema, the ways of Saba, and wait a little while.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">They are confounded, because I have hoped: they are come also even unto me, and are covered with shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Now you are come: and now seeing my affliction you are afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Did I say: Bring to me, and give me of your substance?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Or deliver me from the hand of the enemy, and rescue me out of the hand of the mighty?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Teach me, and I will hold my peace: and if I have been ignorant in any thing, instruct me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Why have you detracted the words of truth, whereas there is none of you that can reprove me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">You dress up speeches only to rebuke, and you utter words to the wind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">You rush in upon the fatherless, and you endeavour to overthrow your friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">However finish what you have begun, give ear, and see whether I lie.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Answer, I beseech you, without contention: and speaking that which is just, judge ye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And you shall not And iniquity in my tongue, neither shall folly sound in my mouth.</p>
