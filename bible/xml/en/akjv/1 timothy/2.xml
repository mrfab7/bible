<chapter book="1 Timothy" number="2" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;</verse>
  <verse number="2">For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior;</verse>
  <verse number="4">Who will have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</verse>
  <verse number="6">Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</verse>
  <verse number="9">In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with modesty and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;</verse>
  <verse number="10">But (which becomes women professing godliness) with good works.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.</verse>
