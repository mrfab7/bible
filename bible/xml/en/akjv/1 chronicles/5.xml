  <verse number="1">Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was the firstborn; but for as much as he defiled his father’s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For Judah prevailed above his brothers, and of him came the chief ruler; but the birthright was Joseph’s:)</verse>
  <verse number="3">The sons, I say, of Reuben the firstborn of Israel were, Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Micah his son, Reaia his son, Baal his son,</verse>
  <verse number="6">Beerah his son, whom Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria carried away captive: he was prince of the Reubenites.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And his brothers by their families, when the genealogy of their generations was reckoned, were the chief, Jeiel, and Zechariah,</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who dwelled in Aroer, even to Nebo and Baalmeon:</verse>
  <verse number="9">And eastward he inhabited to the entering in of the wilderness from the river Euphrates: because their cattle were multiplied in the land of Gilead.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who fell by their hand: and they dwelled in their tents throughout all the east land of Gilead.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the children of Gad dwelled over against them, in the land of Bashan to Salcah:</verse>
  <verse number="12">Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat in Bashan.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And their brothers of the house of their fathers were, Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jachan, and Zia, and Heber, seven.</verse>
  <verse number="14">These are the children of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz;</verse>
  <verse number="15">Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house of their fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they dwelled in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in all the suburbs of Sharon, on their borders.</verse>
  <verse number="17">All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword, and to shoot with bow, and skillful in war, were four and forty thousand seven hundred and three score, that went out to the war.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish, and Nodab.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with them: for they cried to God in the battle, and he was entreated of them; because they put their trust in him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of asses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For there fell down many slain, because the war was of God. And they dwelled in their steads until the captivity.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelled in the land: they increased from Bashan to Baalhermon and Senir, and to mount Hermon.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And these were the heads of the house of their fathers, even Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valor, famous men, and heads of the house of their fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God destroyed before them.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria, and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them to Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, to this day.</verse>
