  <verse number="3">And the battle was severe against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was severely wounded by the archers.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then said Saul to his armor-bearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through with it; lest these uncircumcised should come and thrust me through, and abuse me. But his armor-bearer would not; for he was exceedingly afraid. Therefore Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died with him.</verse>

  <verse number="7">And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side of Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in mount Gilboa.</verse>
