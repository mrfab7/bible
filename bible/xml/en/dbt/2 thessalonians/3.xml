  <verse number="1">For the rest, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may run and be glorified, even as also with you;</verse>
  <verse number="2">and that we may be delivered from bad and evil men, for faith [is] not [the portion] of all.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But the Lord is faithful, who shall establish you and keep [you] from evil.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But we trust in the Lord as to you, that the things which we enjoin, ye both do and will do.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patience of the Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now we enjoin you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw from every brother walking disorderly and not according to the instruction which he received from us.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For ye know yourselves how ye ought to imitate us, because we have not walked disorderly among you;</verse>
  <verse number="8">nor have we eaten bread from any one without cost; but in toil and hardship working night and day not to be chargeable to any one of you:</verse>
  <verse number="9">not that we have not the right, but that we might give ourselves as an example to you, in order to your imitating us.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For also when we were with you we enjoined you this, that if any man does not like to work, neither let him eat.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For we hear that [there are] some walking among you disorderly, not working at all, but busybodies.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now such we enjoin and exhort in [the] Lord Jesus Christ, that working quietly they eat their own bread.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But ye, brethren, do not faint in well-doing.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But if any one obey not our word by the letter, mark that man, and do not keep company with him, that he may be ashamed of himself;</verse>
  <verse number="15">and do not esteem him as an enemy, but admonish [him] as a brother.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But the Lord of peace himself give you peace continually in every way. The Lord [be] with you all.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The salutation by the hand of me, Paul, which is [the] mark in every letter; so I write.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with you all.</verse>
