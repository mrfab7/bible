<chapter book="Job" number="34" translation="King James Bible" translationID="kjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Furthermore Elihu answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hear my words, O ye wise [men]; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what [is] good.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Should I lie against my right? my wound [is] incurable without transgression.</verse>
  <verse number="7">What man [is] like Job, [who] drinketh up scorning like water?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, [that he should do] wickedness; and [from] the Almighty, [that he should commit] iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to [his] ways.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?</verse>
  <verse number="14">If he set his heart upon man, [if] he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</verse>
  <verse number="15">All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If now [thou hast] understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?</verse>
  <verse number="18">[Is it fit] to say to a king, [Thou art] wicked? [and] to princes, [Ye are] ungodly?</verse>
  <verse number="19">[How much less to him] that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all [are] the work of his hands.</verse>
  <verse number="20">In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For his eyes [are] upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.</verse>
  <verse number="22">[There is] no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For he will not lay upon man more [than right]; that he should enter into judgment with God.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth [them] in the night, so that they are destroyed.</verse>
  <verse number="26">He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</verse>
  <verse number="27">Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</verse>
  <verse number="28">So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</verse>
  <verse number="29">When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth [his] face, who then can behold him? whether [it be done] against a nation, or against a man only:</verse>
  <verse number="30">That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne [chastisement], I will not offend [any more]:</verse>
  <verse number="32">[That which] I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</verse>
  <verse number="33">[Should it be] according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words [were] without wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="36">My desire [is that] Job may be tried unto the end because of [his] answers for wicked men.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth [his hands] among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</verse>
