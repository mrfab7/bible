<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Therefore, holy brethren, sharers with others in a heavenly invitation, fix your thoughts on Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest whose followers we profess to be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How faithful He was to Him who appointed Him, just as Moses also was faithful in all God’s house!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For Jesus has been counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, in so far as he who has built a house has higher honour than the house itself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For every house has had a builder, and the builder of all things is God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Moreover, Moses was faithful in all God’s house as a servant in delivering the message given him to speak;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">but Christ was faithful as a Son having authority over God’s house, and we are that house, if we hold firm to the End the boldness and the hope which we boast of as ours.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For this reason—as the Holy Spirit warns us, “To-day, if you hear His voice,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">do not harden your hearts as your forefathers did in the time of the provocation on the day of the temptation in the Desert,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">where your forefathers so sorely tried My patience and saw all that I did during forty years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore I was greatly grieved with that generation, and I said, ‘They are ever going astray in heart, and have not learnt to know My paths.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">As I swore in My anger, they shall not be admitted to My rest”—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">see to it, brethren, that there is never in any one of you—as perhaps there may be—a sinful and unbelieving heart, manifesting itself in revolt from the ever-living God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">On the contrary encourage one another, day after day, so long as To-day lasts, so that not one of you may be hardened through the deceitful character of sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For we have, all alike, become sharers with Christ, if we really hold our first confidence firm to the End;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">seeing that the warning still comes to us, “To-day, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as your forefathers did in the time of the provocation.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For who were they that heard, and yet provoked God? Was it not the whole of the people who had come out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And with whom was God so greatly grieved for forty years? Was it not with those who had sinned, and whose dead bodies fell in the Desert?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And to whom did He swear that they should not be admitted to His rest, if it was not to those who were disobedient?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And so we see that it was owing to lack of faith that they could not be admitted.</p>
