<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceiveth and beareth Cain, and saith, ‘I have gotten a man by Jehovah;’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and she addeth to bear his brother, even Abel. And Abel is feeding a flock, and Cain hath been servant of the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And it cometh to pass at the end of days that Cain bringeth from the fruit of the ground a present to Jehovah;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and Abel, he hath brought, he also, from the female firstlings of his flock, even from their fat ones; and Jehovah looketh unto Abel and unto his present,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and unto Cain and unto his present He hath not looked; and it is very displeasing to Cain, and his countenance is fallen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Jehovah saith unto Cain, ‘Why hast thou displeasure? and why hath thy countenance fallen?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Is there not, if thou dost well, acceptance? and if thou dost not well, at the opening a sin-offering is crouching, and unto thee its desire, and thou rulest over it.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Cain saith unto Abel his brother, ‘Let us go into the field;’ and it cometh to pass in their being in the field, that Cain riseth up against Abel his brother, and slayeth him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Jehovah saith unto Cain, ‘Where is Abel thy brother?’ and he saith, ‘I have not known; my brother’s keeper—I?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And He saith, ‘What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother’s blood is crying unto Me from the ground;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and now, cursed art thou from the ground, which hath opened her mouth to receive the blood of thy brother from thy hand;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">when thou tillest the ground, it doth not add to give its strength to thee—a wanderer, even a trembling one, thou art in the earth.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Cain saith unto Jehovah, ‘Greater is my punishment than to be borne;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">lo, Thou hast driven me to-day from off the face of the ground, and from Thy face I am hid; and I have been a wanderer, even a trembling one, in the earth, and it hath been—every one finding me doth slay me.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Jehovah saith to him, ‘Therefore—of any slayer of Cain sevenfold it is required;’ and Jehovah setteth to Cain a token that none finding him doth slay him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Cain goeth out from before Jehovah, and dwelleth in the land, moving about east of Eden;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">and Cain knoweth his wife, and she conceiveth, and beareth Enoch; and he is building a city, and he calleth the name of the city, according to the name of his son—Enoch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And born to Enoch is Irad; and Irad hath begotten Mehujael; and Mehujael hath begotten Methusael; and Methusael hath begotten Lamech.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Lamech taketh to himself two wives, the name of the one Adah, and the name of the second Zillah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Adah beareth Jabal, he hath been father of those inhabiting tents and purchased possessions;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">and the name of his brother is Jubal, he hath been father of every one handling harp and organ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Zillah she also bare Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron; and a sister of Tubal-Cain is Naamah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Lamech saith to his wives:—‘Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; Wives of Lamech, give ear to my saying: For a man I have slain for my wound, Even a young man for my hurt;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For sevenfold is required for Cain, And for Lamech seventy and sevenfold.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Adam again knoweth his wife, and she beareth a son, and calleth his name Seth, ‘for God hath appointed for me another seed instead of Abel:’ for Cain had slain him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And to Seth, to him also a son hath been born, and he calleth his name Enos; then a beginning was made of preaching in the name of Jehovah.</p>
