  <verse number="1">At that time Jesus went on the sabbath through the cornfields; and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the ears and to eat.</verse>
  <verse number="2">But the Pharisees, seeing [it], said to him, Behold, thy disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on sabbath.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But he said to them, Have ye not read what David did when he was hungry, and they that were with him?</verse>
  <verse number="4">How he entered into the house of God, and ate the shewbread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those with him, but for the priests only?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Or have ye not read in the law that on the sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?</verse>
  <verse number="6">But I say unto you, that there is here what is greater than the temple.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But if ye had known what is: I will have mercy and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For the Son of man is Lord of the sabbath.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And, going away from thence, he came into their synagogue.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And behold, there was a man having his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath? that they might accuse him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But he said to them, What man shall there be of you who has one sheep, and if this fall into a pit on the sabbath, will not lay hold of it and raise [it] up?</verse>
  <verse number="12">How much better then is a man than a sheep! So that it is lawful to do well on the sabbath.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then he says to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched [it] out, and it was restored sound as the other.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But the Pharisees, having gone out, took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But Jesus knowing [it], withdrew thence, and great crowds followed him; and he healed them all:</verse>
  <verse number="16">and charged them strictly that they should not make him publicly known:</verse>
  <verse number="17">that that might be fulfilled which was spoken through Esaias the prophet, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="18">Behold my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul has found its delight. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall shew forth judgment to the nations.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He shall not strive or cry out, nor shall any one hear his voice in the streets;</verse>
  <verse number="20">a bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, until he bring forth judgment unto victory;</verse>
  <verse number="21">and on his name shall [the] nations hope.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Then was brought to him one possessed by a demon, blind and dumb, and he healed him, so that the dumb [man] spake and saw.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And all the crowds were amazed and said, Is this [man] the Son of David?</verse>
  <verse number="24">But the Pharisees, having heard [it], said, This [man] does not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub, prince of demons.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself will not subsist.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then shall his kingdom subsist?</verse>
  <verse number="27">And if I cast out demons by Beelzebub, your sons, by whom do they cast [them] out? For this reason they shall be your judges.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But if I by [the] Spirit of God cast out demons, then indeed the kingdom of God is come upon you.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Or how can any one enter into the house of the strong [man] and plunder his goods, unless first he bind the strong [man]? and then he will plunder his house.</verse>
  <verse number="30">He that is not with me is against me, and he that gathers not with me scatters.</verse>
  <verse number="31">For this reason I say unto you, Every sin and injurious speaking shall be forgiven to men, but speaking injuriously of the Spirit shall not be forgiven to men.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And whosoever shall have spoken a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him; but whosoever shall speak against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this age nor in the coming [one].</verse>
  <verse number="33">Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt. For from the fruit the tree is known.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Offspring of vipers! how can ye speak good things, being wicked? For of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.</verse>
  <verse number="35">The good man out of the good treasure brings forth good things; and the wicked man out of the wicked treasure brings forth wicked things.</verse>
  <verse number="36">But I say unto you, that every idle word which men shall say, they shall render an account of it in judgment-day:</verse>
  <verse number="37">for by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</verse>
  <verse number="38">Then answered him some of the scribes and Pharisees, saying, Teacher, we desire to see a sign from thee.</verse>
  <verse number="39">But he, answering, said to them, A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and a sign shall not be given to it save the sign of Jonas the prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="40">For even as Jonas was in the belly of the great fish three days and three nights, thus shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Ninevites shall stand up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and behold, more than Jonas [is] here.</verse>
  <verse number="42">A queen of [the] south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it; for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and behold, more than Solomon [is] here.</verse>
  <verse number="43">But when the unclean spirit has gone out of the man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and does not find [it].</verse>
  <verse number="44">Then he says, I will return to my house whence I came out; and having come, he finds [it] unoccupied, swept, and adorned.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Then he goes and takes with himself seven other spirits worse than himself, and entering in, they dwell there; and the last condition of that man becomes worse than the first. Thus shall it be to this wicked generation also.</verse>
  <verse number="46">But while he was yet speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him.</verse>
  <verse number="47">Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren are standing without, seeking to speak to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="48">But he answering said to him that spoke to him, Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?</verse>
  <verse number="49">And, stretching out his hand to his disciples, he said, Behold my mother and my brethren;</verse>
  <verse number="50">for whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in [the] heavens, he is my brother, and sister, and mother.</verse>
