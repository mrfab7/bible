<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Hath not man a life of labour upon earth? and are not his days like the days of a hireling?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As a bondman earnestly desireth the shadow, and a hireling expecteth his wages,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If I lie down, I say, When shall I rise up, and the darkness be gone? and I am full of tossings until the dawn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and suppurates.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">My days are swifter than a weaverâ€™s shuttle, and are spent without hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Remember thou that my life is wind; mine eye shall no more see good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The eye of him that hath seen me shall behold me no [more]: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The cloud consumeth and vanisheth away; so he that goeth down to Sheol shall not come up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Therefore I will not restrain my mouth: I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Am I a sea, or a sea-monster, that thou settest a watch over me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">So that my soul chooseth strangling, death, rather than my bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I loathe it; I shall not live always: let me alone, for my days are a breath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">What is man, that thou makest much of him? and that thou settest thy heart upon him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And that thou visitest him every morning, triest him every moment?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">How long wilt thou not look away from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Have I sinned, what do I unto thee, thou Observer of men? Why hast thou set me as an object of assault for thee, so that I am become a burden to myself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And why dost not thou forgive my transgression and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I lie down in the dust, and thou shalt seek me early, and I shall not be.</p>
