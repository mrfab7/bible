<chapter book="Ruth" number="4" translation="Webster Bible Translation" translationID="wbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Then Boaz went up to the gate, and sat down there: and behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by; to whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he said to the kinsman, Naomi, that has come again out of the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech’s:</verse>
  <verse number="4">And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it besides thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot redeem it.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for confirming all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor: and this was a testimony in Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Therefore the kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for thyself. So he drew off his shoe.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the hand of Naomi.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Moreover, Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that hath come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Beth-lehem:</verse>
  <verse number="12">And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young woman.</verse>
  <verse number="13">So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in to her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the women said to Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, who hath not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous in Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he shall be to thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thy old age: for thy daughter-in-law, who loveth thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, hath borne him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became its nurse.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the women, her neighbors, gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of Jesse, the father of David.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.</verse>
