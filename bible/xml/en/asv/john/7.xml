  <verse number="1">And after these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Judæa, because the Jews sought to kill him.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Now the feast of the Jews, the feast of tabernacles, was at hand.</verse>
  <verse number="3">His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judæa, that thy disciples also may behold thy works which thou doest.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For no man doeth anything in secret, and himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou doest these things, manifest thyself to the world.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For even his brethren did not believe on him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Jesus therefore saith unto them, My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that its works are evil.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Go ye up unto the feast: I go not up unto this feast; because my time is not yet fulfilled.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And having said these things unto them, he abode still in Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But when his brethren were gone up unto the feast, then went he also up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</verse>
  <verse number="12">And there was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him: some said, He is a good man; others said, Not so, but he leadeth the multitude astray.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Yet no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But when it was now the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The Jews therefore marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?</verse>
  <verse number="16">Jesus therefore answered them and said, My teaching is not mine, but his that sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">If any man willeth to do his will, he shall know of the teaching, whether it is of God, or whether I speak from myself.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He that speaketh from himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you doeth the law? Why seek ye to kill me?</verse>
  <verse number="20">The multitude answered, Thou hast a demon: who seeketh to kill thee?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Jesus answered and said unto them, I did one work, and ye all marvel because thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Moses hath given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers); and on the sabbath ye circumcise a man.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If a man receiveth circumcision on the sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are ye wroth with me, because I made a man every whit whole on the sabbath?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Judge not according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Some therefore of them of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</verse>
  <verse number="26">And lo, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing unto him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is the Christ?</verse>
  <verse number="27">Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no one knoweth whence he is.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Jesus therefore cried in the temple, teaching and saying, Ye both know me, and know whence I am; and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</verse>
  <verse number="29">I know him; because I am from him, and he sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="30">They sought therefore to take him: and no man laid his hand on him, because his hour was not yet come.</verse>
  <verse number="31">But of the multitude many believed on him; and they said, When the Christ shall come, will he do more signs than those which this man hath done?</verse>
  <verse number="32">The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him; and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Jesus therefore said, Yet a little while am I with you, and I go unto him that sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, ye cannot come.</verse>
  <verse number="35">The Jews therefore said among themselves, Whither will this man go that we shall not find him? will he go unto the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</verse>
  <verse number="36">What is this word that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, ye cannot come?</verse>
  <verse number="37">Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink.</verse>
  <verse number="38">He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, from within him shall flow rivers of living water.</verse>
  <verse number="39">But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believed on him were to receive: for the Spirit was not yet given; because Jesus was not yet glorified.</verse>
  <verse number="40">Some of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, This is of a truth the prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, What, doth the Christ come out of Galilee?</verse>
  <verse number="42">Hath not the scripture said that the Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?</verse>
  <verse number="43">So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</verse>
  <verse number="45">The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why did ye not bring him?</verse>
  <verse number="46">The officers answered, Never man so spake.</verse>
  <verse number="47">The Pharisees therefore answered them, Are ye also led astray?</verse>
  <verse number="48">Hath any of the rulers believed on him, or of the Pharisees?</verse>
  <verse number="49">But this multitude that knoweth not the law are accursed.</verse>
  <verse number="50">Nicodemus saith unto them (he that came to him before, being one of them),</verse>
  <verse number="51">Doth our law judge a man, except it first hear from himself and know what he doeth?</verse>
  <verse number="52">They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="53">[And they went every man unto his own house:</verse>
