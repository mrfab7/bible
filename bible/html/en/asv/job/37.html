<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Yea, at this my heart trembleth, And is moved out of its place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear, oh, hear the noise of his voice, And the sound that goeth out of his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He sendeth it forth under the whole heaven, And his lightning unto the ends of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">After it a voice roareth; He thundereth with the voice of his majesty; And he restraineth not the lightnings when his voice is heard</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">God thundereth marvellously with his voice; Great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For he saith to the snow, Fall thou on the earth; Likewise to the shower of rain, And to the showers of his mighty rain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He sealeth up the hand of every man, That all men whom he hath made may know it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then the beasts go into coverts, And remain in their dens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Out of the chamber of the south cometh the storm, And cold out of the north.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">By the breath of God ice is given; And the breadth of the waters is straitened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Yea, he ladeth the thick cloud with moisture; He spreadeth abroad the cloud of his lightning:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And it is turned round about by his guidance, That they may do whatsoever he commandeth them Upon the face of the habitable world,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whether it be for correction, or for his land, Or for lovingkindness, that he cause it to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Hearken unto this, O Job: Stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Dost thou know how God layeth his charge upon them, And causeth the lightning of his cloud to shine?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, The wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">How thy garments are warm, When the earth is still by reason of the south wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Canst thou with him spread out the sky, Which is strong as a molten mirror?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Teach us what we shall say unto him; For we cannot set our speech in order by reason of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Shall it be told him that I would speak? Or should a man wish that he were swallowed up?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And now men see not the light which is bright in the skies; But the wind passeth, and cleareth them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Out of the north cometh golden splendor: God hath upon him terrible majesty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: He is excellent in power; And in justice and plenteous righteousness he will not afflict.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Men do therefore fear him: He regardeth not any that are wise of heart.</p>
