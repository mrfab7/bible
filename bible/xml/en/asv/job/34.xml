<chapter book="Job" number="34" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Moreover Elihu answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hear my words, ye wise men; And give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the ear trieth words, As the palate tasteth food.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Let us choose for us that which is right: Let us know among ourselves what is good.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For Job hath said, I am righteous, And God hath taken away my right:</verse>
  <verse number="6">Notwithstanding my right I am accounted a liar; My wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.</verse>
  <verse number="7">What man is like Job, Who drinketh up scoffing like water,</verse>
  <verse number="8">Who goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, And walketh with wicked men?</verse>
  <verse number="9">For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing That he should delight himself with God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: Far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, And from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For the work of a man will he render unto him, And cause every man to find according to his ways.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Yea, of a surety, God will not do wickedly, Neither will the Almighty pervert justice.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who gave him a charge over the earth? Or who hath disposed the whole world?</verse>
  <verse number="14">If he set his heart upon himself, If he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</verse>
  <verse number="15">All flesh shall perish together, And man shall turn again unto dust.</verse>
  <verse number="16">If now thou hast understanding, hear this: Hearken to the voice of my words.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Shall even one that hateth justice govern? And wilt thou condemn him that is righteous and mighty?—</verse>
  <verse number="18">Him that saith to a king, Thou art vile, Or to nobles, Ye are wicked;</verse>
  <verse number="19">That respecteth not the persons of princes, Nor regardeth the rich more than the poor; For they all are the work of his hands.</verse>
  <verse number="20">In a moment they die, even at midnight; The people are shaken and pass away, And the mighty are taken away without hand.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For his eyes are upon the ways of a man, And he seeth all his goings.</verse>
  <verse number="22">There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, Where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For he needeth not further to consider a man, That he should go before God in judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He breaketh in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out, And setteth others in their stead.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Therefore he taketh knowledge of their works; And he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</verse>
  <verse number="26">He striketh them as wicked men In the open sight of others;</verse>
  <verse number="27">Because they turned aside from following him, And would not have regard in any of his ways:</verse>
  <verse number="28">So that they caused the cry of the poor to come unto him, And he heard the cry of the afflicted.</verse>
  <verse number="29">When he giveth quietness, who then can condemn? And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? Alike whether it be done unto a nation, or unto a man:</verse>
  <verse number="30">That the godless man reign not, That there be none to ensnare the people.</verse>
  <verse number="31">For hath any said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:</verse>
  <verse number="32">That which I see not teach thou me: If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more?</verse>
  <verse number="33">Shall his recompense be as thou wilt, that thou refusest it? For thou must choose, and not I: Therefore speak what thou knowest.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Men of understanding will say unto me, Yea, every wise man that heareth me:</verse>
  <verse number="35">Job speaketh without knowledge, And his words are without wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Would that Job were tried unto the end, Because of his answering like wicked men.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For he addeth rebellion unto his sin; He clappeth his hands among us, And multiplieth his words against God.</verse>
