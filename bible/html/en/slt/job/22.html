<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Eliphaz the Temanite will answer and say,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Shall a man profit to God as he understanding shall profit for himself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Did it please to the Almighty that thou wilt be just? and if gain if thou wilt perfect thy ways?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Will he reprove thee from thy fear? Will he go with thee into judgment?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Is not thine evil much? and no end to thine iniquities?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For thou wilt take a pledge of thy brethren, in vain, and the garments of the naked thou wilt strip of.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thou wilt not give to the weary one water to drink, and from the hungry one thou wilt withhold bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the man of arm, to him the earth; and the lifted up of face dwelt in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Thou didst send away widows empty, and the arms of the orphans will be broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For this, snares are round about thee, and sudden fear will terrify thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Or darkness thou wilt not see; and abundance of waters shall cover thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Is not God high in the heavens? and see the head of the stars for they were lifted up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And thou saidst How shall God know? Shall he judge in the cloud of darkness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Clouds a covering to him, and he will not see; and he will go about the circle of the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Wilt thou watch the path of old which men of iniquity trod?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Who were laid hold of, and no time a river will pour out their foundation?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">They saying to God, Depart from us: and what shall the Almighty do for them?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he filled their houses with good: and the counsel of the unjust was far from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The just shall see and shall be glad: and the innocent shall deride at them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">If our adversaries were not destroyed, and their remnant the fire shall devour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Be acquainted now with him, and be safe: by them shall good come to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Take now the law from his mouth, and set his words in thy heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If thou wilt turn back even to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt remove iniquity far off from thy tent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Place thou gold upon the dust, and the precious ore of the torrents of Ophir.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And the Almighty was thy gold and silver of labors to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For then upon the Almighty shalt thou delight thyself, and thou shalt lift up thy face to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And thou shalt pray to him, and he will hear thee, and thou shalt repay thy vows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And thou shalt decide the word, and it shall be set up to thee: and the light shone upon thy ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For they were humbled, and thou wilt say, A lifting up; and he will save him depressed of eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He will deliver the island of the innocent: and it was delivered by the pureness of thine hands.</p>
