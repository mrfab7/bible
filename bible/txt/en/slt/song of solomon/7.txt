1	How beautiful were thy steps with shoes, O daughter of a noble! the circuits of thy thighs a necklace, the work of the hands of an artist.
2	Thy navel a bowl of roundness, it will not want mixed wine; thy belly a heap of wheat enclosed with lilies.
3	Thy two breasts as two fawns, twins of the roe-deer.
4	Thy neck as a tower of ivory; thine eyes pools in Heshbon, by the gate of the daughter of many: thy nose as the tower of Lebanon viewing the face of Damascus.
5	Thy head upon thee as Carmel, and the locks of thy head as purple; the King being bound in curls.
6	How beautiful and how pleasant thou wert, O love, in delights!
7	This thy height was like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters.
8	I said, I will go up upon the palm tree, I will hold fast upon its branches: and now thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the odor of thy nose as apples.
9	And thy palate as good wine going to my beloved for uprightness, causing the lips of the sleeping to flow softly.
10	I to my beloved, and upon me his desire.
11	Come, my beloved, we will go forth to the field; we will lodge in the villages.
12	We will rise early to the vineyards; we will see if the vine was fruitful, the vine blossoms opened, the pomegranates blossomed: there will I give my beloved to thee.
13	The mandrakes gave an odor, and upon our entrances all precious things, new also old, my beloved, I laid up for thee.
