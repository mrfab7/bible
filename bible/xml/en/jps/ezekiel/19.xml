  <verse number="1">Moreover, take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and say: How was thy mother a lioness; Among lions she couched, In the midst of the young lions She reared her whelps!</verse>
  <verse number="3">And she brought up one of her whelps, He became a young lion; And he learned to catch the prey, He devoured men.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Then the nations assembled against him, He was taken in their pit; And they brought him with hooks Unto the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now when she saw that she was disappointed, And her hope was lost, Then she took another of her whelps, And made him a young lion.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he went up and down among the lions, He became a young lion; And he learned to catch the prey, He devoured men.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he knew their castles, And laid waste their cities; And the land was desolate, And the fulness thereof, Because of the noise of his roaring.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then the nations cried out against him On every side from the provinces; And they spread their net over him, He was taken in their pit.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they put him in a cage with hooks, And brought him to the king of Babylon; That they might bring him into strongholds, So that his voice should no more be heard Upon the mountains of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Thy mother was like a vine, in thy likeness, Planted by the waters; She was fruitful and full of branches By reason of many waters.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And she had strong rods To be sceptres for them that bore rule; And her stature was exalted Among the thick branches, And she was seen in her height With the multitude of her tendrils.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But she was plucked up in fury, She was cast down to the ground, And the east wind dried up her fruit; Her strong rods were broken off and withered, The fire consumed her.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And now she is planted in the wilderness, In a dry and thirsty ground.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And fire is gone out of the rod of her branches, It hath devoured her fruit, So that there is in her no strong rod To be a sceptre to rule.’ This is a lamentation, and it was for a lamentation.</verse>
