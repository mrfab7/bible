1	Right wouldest Thou be, O LORD, Were I to contend with Thee, Yet will I reason with Thee: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? Wherefore are all they secure that deal very treacherously?
2	Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root; They grow, yea, they bring forth fruit; Thou art near in their mouth, And far from their reins.
3	But Thou, O LORD, knowest me, Thou seest me, and triest my heart toward Thee; Pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, And prepare them for the day of slaughter.
4	How long shall the land mourn, And the herbs of the whole field wither? For the wickedness of them that dwell therein, the beasts are consumed, and the birds; Because they said: ‘He seeth not our end.’
5	If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, Then how canst thou contend with horses? And though in a land of peace thou art secure, Yet how wilt thou do in the thickets of the Jordan?
6	For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, Even they have dealt treacherously with thee, Even they have cried aloud after thee; Believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.’
7	I have forsaken My house, I have cast off My heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of My soul Into the hand of her enemies.
8	My heritage is become unto Me As a lion in the forest; She hath uttered her voice against Me; Therefore have I hated her.
9	Is My heritage unto Me as a speckled bird of prey? Are the birds of prey against her round about? Come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, Bring them to devour.
10	Many shepherds have destroyed My vineyard, They have trodden My portion under foot, They have made My pleasant portion A desolate wilderness.
11	They have made it a desolation, It mourneth unto Me, being desolate; The whole land is made desolate, Because no man layeth it to heart.
12	Upon all the high hills in the wilderness spoilers are come; For the sword of the LORD devoureth From the one end of the land even to the other end of the land, No flesh hath peace.
13	They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; They have put themselves to pain, they profit not; Be ye then ashamed of your increase, Because of the fierce anger of the LORD.
14	Thus saith the LORD: As for all Mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused My people Israel to inherit, behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.
15	And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them up, I will again have compassion on them; and I will bring them back, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.
16	And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of My people to swear by My name: ‘As the LORD liveth,’ even as they taught My people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built up in the midst of My people.
17	But if they will not hearken, then will I pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, saith the LORD.
