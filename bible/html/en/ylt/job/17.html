<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My spirit hath been destroyed, My days extinguished—graves are for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">If not—mockeries are with me. And in their provocations mine eye lodgeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Place, I pray Thee, my pledge with Thee; Who is he that striketh hand with me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For their heart Thou hast hidden From understanding, Therefore Thou dost not exalt them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For a portion he sheweth friendship, And the eyes of his sons are consumed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he set me up for a proverb of the peoples, And a wonder before them I am.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And dim from sorrow is mine eye, And my members as a shadow all of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Astonished are the upright at this, And the innocent against the profane Stirreth himself up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the righteous layeth hold on his way, And the clean of hands addeth strength, And—dumb are they all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Return, and come in, I pray you, And I find not among you a wise man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My days have passed by, My devices have been broken off, The possessions of my heart!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Night for day they appoint, Light is near because of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I wait—Sheol is my house, In darkness I have spread out my couch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">To corruption I have called:—‘Thou art my father.’ ‘My mother’ and ‘my sister’—to the worm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And where is now my hope? Yea, my hope, who doth behold it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">To the parts of Sheol ye go down, If together on the dust we may rest.</p>
