<chapter book="Job" number="7" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The life of a man on the earth is a battle, and his days are like the days of a hired hand.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Just as a servant desires the shade, and just as the hired hand looks forward to the end of his work,</verse>
  <verse number="3">so also have I had empty months and have counted my burdensome nights.</verse>
  <verse number="4">If I lie down to sleep, I will say, “When will I rise?” And next I will hope for the evening and will be filled with sorrows even until darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="5">My flesh is clothed with particles of rottenness and filth; my skin is dried up and tightened.</verse>
  <verse number="6">My days have passed by more quickly than threads are cut by a weaver, and they have been consumed without any hope.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Remember that my life is wind, and my eye will not return to see good things.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Neither will the sight of man gaze upon me; your eyes are upon me, and I will not endure.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Just as a cloud is consumed and passes away, so he who descends to hell will not ascend.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He will not return again to his house, nor will his own place know him any longer.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And because of this, I will not restrain my mouth. I will speak in the affliction of my spirit. I will converse from the bitterness of my soul.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Am I an ocean or a whale, that you have encircled me in a prison?</verse>
  <verse number="13">If I say, “My bed will comfort me, and I will find rest, speaking with myself on my blanket,”</verse>
  <verse number="14">then you will frighten me with dreams, and strike dread through visions,</verse>
  <verse number="15">so that, because of these things, my soul would choose hanging, and my bones, death.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I despair; by no means will I live any longer. Spare me, for my days are nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="17">What is man, that you should praise him? Or why do you place your heart near him?</verse>
  <verse number="18">You visit him at dawn, and you test him unexpectedly.</verse>
  <verse number="19">How long will you not spare me, nor release me to ingest my saliva?</verse>
  <verse number="20">I have sinned; what should I do for you, O keeper of men? Why have you set me against you, so that I have become burdensome even to myself?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Why do you not steal away my sin, and why do you not sweep away my iniquity? Behold, now I will sleep in the dust, and if you seek me in the morning, I will not remain.</verse>
