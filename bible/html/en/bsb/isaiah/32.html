<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="32" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Behold, a king will reign in righteousness, and princes will rule with justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Each will be like a shelter from the wind, a refuge from the storm, like streams of water in a dry land, like the shadow of a great rock in an arid land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed, and the ears of those who hear will listen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The mind of the rash will know and understand, and the stammering tongue will speak clearly and fluently.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">No longer will a fool be called noble, nor a scoundrel be respected.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For a fool speaks foolishness; his mind plots iniquity. He practices ungodliness and speaks falsely about the LORD; he leaves the hungry empty and deprives the thirsty of drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The weapons of the scoundrel are destructive; he hatches plots to destroy the poor with lies, even when the plea of the needy is just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But a noble man makes honorable plans; he stands up for worthy causes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Stand up, you complacent women; listen to me. Give ear to my word, you overconfident daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">In a little more than a year you will tremble, O secure ones. For the grape harvest will fail and the fruit harvest will not arrive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Shudder, you ladies of leisure; tremble, you daughters of complacency. Strip yourselves bare and put sackcloth around your waists.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Beat your breasts for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vines,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">and for the land of my people, overgrown with thorns and briers—even for every house of merriment in this city of revelry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For the palace will be forsaken, the busy city abandoned. The hill and the watchtower will become caves forever—the delight of wild donkeys and a pasture for flocks—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">until the Spirit is poured out upon us from on high. Then the desert will be an orchard, and the orchard will seem like a forest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Then justice will inhabit the wilderness, and righteousness will dwell in the fertile field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The work of righteousness will be peace; the service of righteousness will be quiet confidence forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then my people will dwell in a peaceful place, in safe and secure places of rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But hail will level the forest, and the city will sink to the depths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Blessed are those who sow beside abundant waters, who let the ox and donkey range freely.</p>
