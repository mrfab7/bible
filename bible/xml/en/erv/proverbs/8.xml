  <verse number="1">Doth not wisdom cry, and understanding put forth her voice?</verse>
  <verse number="2">In the top of high places by the way, where the paths meet, she standeth;</verse>
  <verse number="3">Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud:</verse>
  <verse number="4">Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of men.</verse>
  <verse number="5">O ye simple, understand subtilty; and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Hear, for I will speak excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For my mouth shall utter truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</verse>
  <verse number="8">All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing crooked or perverse in them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared unto her.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I wisdom have made subtilty my dwelling, and find out knowledge and discretion.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Counsel is mine, and sound knowledge: I am understanding; I have might.</verse>
  <verse number="15">By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.</verse>
  <verse number="16">By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I love them that love me; and those that seek me diligently shall find me.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="19">My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.</verse>
  <verse number="20">I walk in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:</verse>
  <verse number="21">That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance, and that I may fill their treasuries.</verse>
  <verse number="22">The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</verse>
  <verse number="23">I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</verse>
  <verse number="24">When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:</verse>
  <verse number="26">While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the beginning of the dust of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="27">When he established the heavens, I was there: when he set a circle upon the face of the deep:</verse>
  <verse number="28">When he made firm the sides above: when the fountains of the deep became strong:</verse>
  <verse number="29">When he gave to the sea its bound, that the waters should not transgress his commandment: when he marked out the foundations of the earth:</verse>
  <verse number="30">Then I was by him, as a master workman: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;</verse>
  <verse number="31">Rejoicing in his habitable earth; and my delight was with the sons of men.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me: for blessed are they that keep my ways.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</verse>
  <verse number="35">For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="36">But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.</verse>
