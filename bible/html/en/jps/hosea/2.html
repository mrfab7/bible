<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Say ye unto your brethren: ‘ Ammi’; and to your sisters, ‘ Ruhamah.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Plead with your mother, plead; For she is not My wife, neither am I her husband; And let her put away her harlotries from her face, And her adulteries from between her breasts;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Lest I strip her naked, And set her as in the day that she was born, And make her as a wilderness, And set her like a dry land, And slay her with thirst.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I will not have compassion upon her children; For they are children of harlotry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For their mother hath played the harlot, She that conceived them hath done shamefully; For she said: ‘I will go after my lovers, That give me my bread and my water, My wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, And I will make a wall against her, That she shall not find her paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And she shall run after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them, And she shall seek them, but shall not find them; Then shall she say: ‘I will go and return to my first husband; For then was it better with me than now.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For she did not know that it was I that gave her The corn, and the wine, and the oil, And multiplied unto her silver and gold, Which they used for Baal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Therefore will I take back My corn in the time thereof, And My wine in the season thereof, And will snatch away My wool and My flax Given to cover her nakedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And now will I uncover her shame in the sight of her lovers, And none shall deliver her out of My hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I will also cause all her mirth to cease, Her feasts, her new moons, and her sabbaths, And all her appointed seasons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And I will lay waste her vines and her fig-trees, Whereof she hath said: ‘These are my hire That my lovers have given me’; And I will make them a forest, And the beasts of the field shall eat them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And I will visit upon her the days of the Baalim, Wherein she offered unto them, And decked herself with her ear-rings and her jewels, And went after her lovers, And forgot Me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Therefore, behold, I will allure her, And bring her into the wilderness, And speak tenderly unto her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And I will give her her vineyards from thence, And the valley of Achor for a door of hope; And she shall respond there, as in the days of her youth, And as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, That thou shalt call Me Ishi, And shalt call Me no more Baali.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For I will take away the names of the Baalim out of her mouth, And they shall no more be mentioned by their name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And in that day will I make a covenant for them With the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven, And with the creeping things of the ground; And I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, And will make them to lie down safely.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And I will betroth thee unto Me for ever; Yea, I will betroth thee unto Me in righteousness, and in justice, And in lovingkindness, and in compassion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And I will betroth thee unto Me in faithfulness; And thou shalt know the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And it shall come to pass in that day, I will respond, saith the LORD, I will respond to the heavens, And they shall respond to the earth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the earth shall respond to the corn, and the wine, and the oil; And they shall respond to Jezreel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And I will sow her unto Me in the land; And I will have compassion upon her that had not obtained compassion; And I will say to them that were not My people: ‘Thou art My people’; And they shall say: ‘Thou art my God.’</p>
