  <verse number="1">Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech, And hearken to all my words.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Behold now, I have opened my mouth, My tongue hath spoken in my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart; And that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the Almighty given me life.</verse>
  <verse number="5">If thou canst, answer thou me, Set thy words in order before me, stand forth.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Behold, I am toward God even as thou art; I also am formed out of the clay.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, Neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the voice of thy words;</verse>
  <verse number="9">I am clean, without transgression, I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me;</verse>
  <verse number="10">Behold, He findeth occasions against me, He counteth me for His enemy;</verse>
  <verse number="11">He putteth my feet in the stocks, He marketh all my paths.’</verse>
  <verse number="12">Behold, I answer thee: In this thou art not right, That God is too great for man;</verse>
  <verse number="13">Why hast thou striven against Him? Seeing that He will not answer any of his words.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For God speaketh in one way, Yea in two, though man perceiveth it not.</verse>
  <verse number="15">In a dream, in a vision of the night, When deep sleep falleth upon men, In slumberings upon the bed;</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then He openeth the ears of men, And by their chastisement sealeth the decree,</verse>
  <verse number="17">That men may put away their purpose, And that He may hide pride from man;</verse>
  <verse number="18">That He may keep back his soul from the pit, And his life from perishing by the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, And all his bones grow stiff;</verse>
  <verse number="20">So that his life maketh him to abhor bread, And his soul dainty food.</verse>
  <verse number="21">His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; And his bones corrode to unsightliness.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, And his life to the destroyers.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If there be for him an angel, An intercessor, one among a thousand, To vouch for a man’s uprightness;</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then He is gracious unto him, and saith: ‘Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.’</verse>
  <verse number="25">His flesh is tenderer than a child’s; He returneth to the days of his youth;</verse>
  <verse number="26">He prayeth unto God, and He is favourable unto him; So that he seeth His face with joy; And He restoreth unto man his righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="27">He cometh before men, and saith: ‘I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, And it profited me not.’</verse>
  <verse number="28">So He redeemeth his soul from going into the pit, And his life beholdeth the light.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Lo, all these things doth God work, Twice, yea thrice, with a man,</verse>
  <verse number="30">To bring back his soul from the pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of the living.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me; Hold thy peace, and I will speak.</verse>
  <verse number="32">If thou hast any thing to say, answer me; Speak, for I desire to justify thee.</verse>
  <verse number="33">If not, hearken thou unto me; Hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.</verse>
