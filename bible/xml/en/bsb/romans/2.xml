<chapter book="Romans" number="2" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">You, therefore, have no excuse, you who pass judgment on another. For on whatever grounds you judge the other, you are condemning yourself, because you who pass judgment do the same things.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And we know that God’s judgment against those who do such things is based on truth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">So when you, O man, pass judgment on others, yet do the same things, do you think you will escape God’s judgment?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Or do you disregard the riches of His kindness, tolerance, and patience, not realizing that God’s kindness leads you to repentance?</verse>
  <verse number="5">But because of your hard and unrepentant heart, you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of wrath, when God’s righteous judgment will be revealed.</verse>
  <verse number="6">God “will repay each one according to his deeds.”</verse>
  <verse number="7">To those who by perseverance in doing good seek glory, honor, and immortality, He will give eternal life.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow wickedness, there will be wrath and anger.</verse>
  <verse number="9">There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil, first for the Jew, then for the Greek;</verse>
  <verse number="10">but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does good, first for the Jew, then for the Greek.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For God does not show favoritism.</verse>
  <verse number="12">All who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but it is the doers of the law who will be declared righteous.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Indeed, when Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.</verse>
  <verse number="15">So they show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, their consciences also bearing witness, and their thoughts either accusing or defending them</verse>
  <verse number="16">on the day when God will judge men’s secrets through Christ Jesus, as proclaimed by my gospel.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Now you, if you call yourself a Jew; if you rely on the law and boast in God;</verse>
  <verse number="18">if you know His will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law;</verse>
  <verse number="19">if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light for those in darkness,</verse>
  <verse number="20">an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth—</verse>
  <verse number="21">you, then, who teach others, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal?</verse>
  <verse number="22">You who forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</verse>
  <verse number="23">You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law?</verse>
  <verse number="24">As it is written: “God’s name is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">Circumcision has value if you observe the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</verse>
  <verse number="26">If a man who is not circumcised keeps the requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?</verse>
  <verse number="27">The one who is physically uncircumcised yet keeps the law will condemn you who, even though you have the written code and circumcision, are a lawbreaker.</verse>
  <verse number="28">A man is not a Jew because he is one outwardly, nor is circumcision only outward and physical.</verse>
  <verse number="29">No, a man is a Jew because he is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the written code. Such a man’s praise does not come from men, but from God.</verse>
