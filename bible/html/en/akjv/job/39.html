<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="39" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Know you the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or can you mark when the hinds do calve?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Can you number the months that they fulfill? or know you the time when they bring forth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who has sent out the wild ass free? or who has loosed the bands of the wild ass?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He scorns the multitude of the city, neither regards he the crying of the driver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searches after every green thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Will the unicorn be willing to serve you, or abide by your crib?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Can you bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Will you trust him, because his strength is great? or will you leave your labor to him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Will you believe him, that he will bring home your seed, and gather it into your barn?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Gave you the goodly wings to the peacocks? or wings and feathers to the ostrich?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Which leaves her eggs in the earth, and warms them in dust,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And forgets that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not herâ€™s: her labor is in vain without fear;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Because God has deprived her of wisdom, neither has he imparted to her understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">What time she lifts up herself on high, she scorns the horse and his rider.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Have you given the horse strength? have you clothed his neck with thunder?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Can you make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He paws in the valley, and rejoices in his strength: he goes on to meet the armed men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He mocks at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turns he back from the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The quiver rattles against him, the glittering spear and the shield.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He swallows the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believes he that it is the sound of the trumpet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He said among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smells the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Does the hawk fly by your wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Does the eagle mount up at your command, and make her nest on high?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">She dwells and stays on the rock, on the crag of the rock, and the strong place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">From there she seeks the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.</p>
