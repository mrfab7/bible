<div class="chapter" data-book="Romans" data-chapter="14" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">NOW him that is weak in faith, take unto you: not in disputes about thoughts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For one believeth that he may eat all things: but he that is weak, let him eat herbs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not: and he that eateth not, let him not judge him that eateth. For God hath taken him to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? To his own lord he standeth or falleth. And he shall stand: for God is able to make him stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For one judgeth between day and day: and another judgeth every day: let every man abound in his own sense.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord. And he that eateth, eateth to the Lord: for he giveth thanks to God. And he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth thanks to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For none of us liveth to himself; and no man dieth to himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Therefore, whether we live, or whether we die, we are the Lord’s.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For to this end Christ died and rose again; that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? or thou, why dost thou despise thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Therefore every one of us shall render account to God for himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Let us not therefore judge one another any more. But judge this rather, that you put not a stumblingblock or a scandal in your brother’s way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I know, and am confident in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For if, because of thy meat, thy brother be grieved, thou walkest not now according to charity. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let not then our good be evil spoken of.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but justice, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For he that in this serveth Christ, pleaseth God, and is approved of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Therefore let us follow after the things that are of peace; and keep the things that are of edification one towards another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Destroy not the work of God for meat. All things indeed are clean: but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">It is good not to eat flesh, and not to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother is offended, or scandalized, or made weak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Hast thou faith? Have it to thyself before God. Blessed is he that condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But he that discerneth, if he eat, is condemned; because not of faith. For all that is not of faith is sin.</p>
