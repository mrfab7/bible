  <verse number="1">And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favored cows and fat; and they fed in a meadow.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And, behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ill favored and skinney; and stood by the other cows on the brink of the river.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the ill favored and skinney cows did eat up the seven well favored and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up on one stalk, rank and good.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them to Pharaoh.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Then spoke the chief butler to Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard’s house, both me and the chief baker:</verse>
  <verse number="11">And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored to my office, and him he hanged.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in to Pharaoh.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of you, that you can understand a dream to interpret it.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Pharaoh said to Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood on the bank of the river:</verse>
  <verse number="18">And, behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, fat and well favored; and they fed in a meadow:</verse>
  <verse number="19">And, behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ill favored and skinney, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the lean and the ill favored cows did eat up the first seven fat cows:</verse>
  <verse number="21">And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favored, as at the beginning. So I awoke.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:</verse>
  <verse number="23">And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them:</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this to the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And Joseph said to Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God has showed Pharaoh what he is about to do.</verse>
  <verse number="26">The seven good cows are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And the seven thin and ill favored cows that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.</verse>
  <verse number="28">This is the thing which I have spoken to Pharaoh: What God is about to do he shows to Pharaoh.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt:</verse>
  <verse number="30">And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And for that the dream was doubled to Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the land perish not through the famine.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And Pharaoh said to his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?</verse>
  <verse number="39">And Pharaoh said to Joseph, For as much as God has showed you all this, there is none so discreet and wise as you are:</verse>
  <verse number="40">You shall be over my house, and according to your word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than you.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it on Joseph’s hand, and arrayed him in clothing of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;</verse>
  <verse number="43">And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without you shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="47">And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.</verse>
  <verse number="48">And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same.</verse>
  <verse number="49">And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.</verse>
  <verse number="50">And to Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bore to him.</verse>
  <verse number="51">And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God, said he, has made me forget all my toil, and all my father’s house.</verse>
  <verse number="52">And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.</verse>
  <verse number="53">And the seven years of plenty, that was in the land of Egypt, were ended.</verse>
  <verse number="54">And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.</verse>
  <verse number="55">And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, Go to Joseph; what he said to you, do.</verse>
  <verse number="56">And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="57">And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.</verse>
