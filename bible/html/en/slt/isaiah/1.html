<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="1" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The vision of Isaiah son of Amos which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear, ye heavens, and give ear thou earth, for Jehovah spake: for I caused to grow and lifted up sons, and they rebelled against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The ox knew his possessor, and the ass his lordâ€™s stall: Israel knew not; my people understood not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Wo! sinful nation, a people heavy with sin, a seed doing evil, sons acting wickedly; they forsook Jehovah; they despised the holy one of Israel; they separated themselves backward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For what shall ye be yet struck? will ye add apostasy? every head for sickness, and every heart sick.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">From the sole of the foot and even to the head, no wholeness in it; a wound and bruise, and a fresh blow: they were not pressed out, and they were not bound up, and they were not softened with oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Your land made desolate, your cities burnt with fire, your land before your strangers eating it up, and made desolate, as the overthrow of strangers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the daughter of Zion was left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a field of cucumbers, as a city besieged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Unless Jehovah of armies left to us an escaping so small, we were as Sodom and we were made like to Gomorrah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Hear the word of Jehovah, ye leaders of Sodom: give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For what to me the multitude of your sacrifices? Jehovah will say: I was filled with the burnt-offerings of rams and the fat of fatlings; and I delighted not in the blood of bullocks, and of he lambs and of he goats.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When ye shall come to be seen before me who sought this from your hand to tread my enclosure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Ye shall not add to bring gifts of iniquity; incense, this an abomination to me; the new moon and the Sabbath, the calling of the assembly; I shall not be able to bear vanity and restraining.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Your new moons and your appointments my soul hated; they were for a burden upon me; I was wearied to lift up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And in the spreading forth of your hands I will hide mine eyes from you; also when ye shall multiply prayer I hear not: your hands were full of blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Wash ye, cleanse yourselves: turn away evil from your doings from before mine eyes; leave off the evil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Learn to do good; seek out judgment, lead right the oppressor, judge the orphan, contend for the widow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Come now we will confute together Jehovah will say: if your sins shall be as deep scarlet, they shall be white as snow; if they shall be red as crimson, they shall be as wool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If ye shall be willing and hear, ye shall eat the good of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And if ye shall refuse and rebel, ye shall be eaten by the sword: for the mouth of Jehovah spake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">How was the faithful city for a harlot! I filled with judgment; justice will lodge in her; and now they are killing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Thy silver was for dross, thy wine adulterated with water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Thy chiefs turning away, and associates of thieves: every one loving a gift and following recompenses: the orphan they will not judge, and the cause of the widow will not come to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For this says the lord Jehovah of armies, the mighty one of Israel, Wo! I will take vengeance of mine adversaries, and I will avenge myself of mine enemies:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And I will turn back my hand upon thee, end I will straiten thy dross according to pureness, and I will remove all thine alloy:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And I will turn back thy judges as in the beginning, and thy counsellors as in the beginning: after this he shall call to thee, The city of justice, the faithful city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Zion shall be ransomed with judgment and her captivity with justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Breaking the transgressing and the sinning together, and they forsaking Jehovah shall be finished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For they shall be ashamed of their mighty ones which ye desired, and ye shall blush for the gardens which ye chose.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">For ye shall be as an oak the leaf withering, and as a garden which there no water to it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And the strong was for tow, and his work for a spark, and they two were burnt together, and none quenching.</p>
