  <verse number="1">Be ye not many teachers, my brethren, knowing that we shall receive the greater judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For in many things we all stumble. If any stumble not in word, this a perfect man, able to govern by a bridle also the whole body.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they should yield to us; and we lead their whole body.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Behold also ships, being so great, and driven by hard winds, are led by the smallest rudder, wherever the desire of him steering should will.</verse>
  <verse number="5">So also the tongue is a small member, and vaunts itself. Behold, how great a wood a little fire inflames.</verse>
  <verse number="6">(And the tongue a fire, a world of iniquity: so the tongue is placed in our members, defiling the whole body, and burning the wheel of creation; and burned by hell.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For every nature of beasts, and also of birds, of creeping things, and also of things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed by the nature of man:</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the tongue none of men can tame; an ungovernable evil, full of deadly poison.</verse>
  <verse number="9">With it we praise the God and Father; and with it we curse men, those made according to the similitude of God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Out of the same month comes forth blessing and cursing. There is no need, my brethren, for these things so to be.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Much less from the same aperture does a fountain bubble out sweet and bitter?</verse>
  <verse number="12">The fig tree, my brethren, cannot make olives, or the vine, figs: so no fountain can make salt and sweet water.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who wise and knowing among you? let him show out of a good mode of life his works in meekness of wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And if ye have bitter envy and intrigue in your heart, boast not, and lie not against the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">This is wisdom coming not down from above, but earthly, natural, resembling an evil spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For where envy and intrigue, there confusion and every bad deed.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the wisdom from above is truly first pure, then peaceful, decorous, docile, full of mercy and good fruits, not separated, and unfeigned.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the fruit of justice is sown in peace by those making peace.</verse>
