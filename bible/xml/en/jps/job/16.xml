  <verse number="1">Then Job answered and said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">I have heard many such things; Sorry comforters are ye all.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Shall windy words have an end? Or what provoketh thee that thou answerest?</verse>
  <verse number="4">I also could speak as ye do; If your soul were in my soul’s stead, I could join words together against you, And shake my head at you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">I would strengthen you with my mouth, And the moving of my lips would assuage your grief.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Though I speak, my pain is not assuaged; And though I forbear, what am I eased?</verse>
  <verse number="7">But now He hath made me weary; Thou hast made desolate all my company.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Thou hast shrivelled me up, which is a witness against me; And my leanness riseth up against me, it testifieth to my face.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He hath torn me in His wrath, and hated me; He hath gnashed upon me with His teeth; Mine adversary sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They have gaped upon me with their mouth; They have smitten me upon the cheek scornfully; They gather themselves together against me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">God delivereth me to the ungodly, And casteth me into the hands of the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I was at ease, and He broke me asunder; Yea, He hath taken me by the neck, and dashed me to pieces; He hath also set me up for His mark.</verse>
  <verse number="13">His archers compass me round about, He cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; He poureth out my gall upon the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He breaketh me with breach upon breach; He runneth upon me like a giant.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, And have laid my horn in the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="16">My face is reddened with weeping, And on my eyelids is the shadow of death;</verse>
  <verse number="17">Although there is no violence in my hands, And my prayer is pure.</verse>
  <verse number="18">O earth, cover not thou my blood, And let my cry have no resting-place.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Even now, behold, my Witness is in heaven, And He that testifieth of me is on high.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Mine inward thoughts are my intercessors, Mine eye poureth out tears unto God;</verse>
  <verse number="21">That He would set aright a man contending with God, As a son of man setteth aright his neighbour!</verse>
  <verse number="22">For the years that are few are coming on, And I shall go the way whence I shall not return.</verse>
