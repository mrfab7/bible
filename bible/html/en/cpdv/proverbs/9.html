<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="9" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wisdom has built a house for herself. She has hewn seven columns.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">She has immolated her victims. She has mixed her wine and set forth her table.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">She has sent her maids to call out to the tower and to the fortified walls of the city,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">“If anyone is little, let him come to me.” And to the unwise, she has said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">“Approach. Eat my bread, and drink the wine that I have mixed for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Leave behind childishness. And live and walk by the ways of prudence.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Whoever teaches a mocker causes injury to himself. And whoever argues with the impious produces a blemish on himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Do not be willing to argue with a mocker, lest he hate you. Dispute with the wise, and he will love you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Present an opportunity to the wise, and wisdom shall be added to him. Teach the just, and he will hurry to receive it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and knowledge of holiness is prudence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For by me, your days will be multiplied and years of life will be added to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If you would be wise, you will be so for yourself. But if you would be one who ridicules, you alone shall carry the evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A foolish and loud woman, who is full of enticements and who knows nothing at all,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">sat at the entrance of her house on a seat, in a high place of the city,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">so as to call to those who were passing by the way and continuing on their journey:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">“Whoever is little, let him turn aside to me.” And to the frenzied, she said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">“Stolen waters are more soothing, and secret bread is more pleasant.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he did not know that giants are there, and that her companions are in the depths of Hell.</p>
