<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah will speak to Moses in the desert of Sinai, in the second year of their coming out of the land of Egypt, in the first month, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the sons of Israel shall do the passover in its appointment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">In the fourteenth day of this month, between the evenings ye shall do it in its appointment, according to all its laws, and according to all its judgments ye shall do it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Moses will speak to the sons of Israel to do the passover.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And they will do the passover in the first, in the fourteenth day of the month, between the evenings, in the desert of Sinai: according to all which Jehovah commanded Moses, so did the sons of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And there shall be men who were unclean by the soul of man, and they will not be able to do the passover in that day: and they came near before Moses and before Aaron, in that day:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And these men will say to him, We are unclean by the soul of man: wherefore shall we be withheld so as not to bring near an offering of Jehovah at his appointment, in the midst of the sons of Israel?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Moses will say to them, Stand ye, and I will hear what Jehovah will command for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, A man, a man when he shall be unclean by the soul, or in a way far off to you or to your generations, and he did the passover to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">In the second month, in the fourteenth day, between the evenings they shall do it, upon unleavened and bitter herbs they shall eat it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They shall not leave from it till morning, and a bone they shall not break in it: according to all the laws of the passover they shall do it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the man who is clean, and was not in the way, and failed to do the passover, that soul was cut off from its people; for he brought not the offering of Jehovah at his appointment, that man shall bear his sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And when a stranger shall sojourn with you, and he did the passover to Jehovah; according to the law of the passover and according to its judgment, so shall he do: one law shall be to you, and to the stranger, and to the native of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And in the day of the raising up the dwelling the cloud covered the dwelling of the tent of testimony: and in the evening it shall be upon the tent as the appearance of fire till morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">So shall it be always: the cloud shall cover it, and the appearance of fire by night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And when the cloud went up from the tent, and after this the sons of Israel shall remove: and in the place where the cloud shall dwell there, there shall the sons of Israel encamp.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">At the mouth of Jehovah the sons of Israel will remove, and at the mouth of Jehovah they will encamp: all the days which the cloud shall dwell upon the dwelling they shall encamp.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And in the prolonging of the cloud upon the dwelling many days, and the sons of Israel shall watch the watches of Jehovah, and they shall not remove.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And it is, when the cloud shall be days of number upon the dwelling, at the mouth of Jehovah they shall encamp, and at the mouth of Jehovah they shall remove.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And it is when the cloud shall be from evening to morning, and the cloud went up in the morning, and they shall remove: either day or by night, and the cloud went up and they removed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Or days, or a month, or days, in the prolonging of the cloud upon the dwelling to dwell upon it, the sons of Israel shall encamp, and they shall not remove; and in its going up they shall remove.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">At the mouth of Jehovah they shall encamp, and at the mouth of Jehovah, they shall remove; the watches of Jehovah they watched, at the mouth of Jehovah by the hand of Moses.</p>
