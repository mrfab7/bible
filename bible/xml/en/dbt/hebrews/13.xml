  <verse number="1">Let brotherly love abide.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Be not forgetful of hospitality; for by it some have unawares entertained angels.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Remember prisoners, as bound with [them]; those that are evil-treated, as being yourselves also in [the] body.</verse>
  <verse number="4">[Let] marriage [be held] every way in honour, and the bed [be] undefiled; for fornicators and adulterers will God judge.</verse>
  <verse number="5">[Let your] conversation [be] without love of money, satisfied with [your] present circumstances; for he has said, I will not leave thee, neither will I forsake thee.</verse>
  <verse number="6">So that, taking courage, we may say, The Lord [is] my helper, and I will not be afraid: what will man do unto me?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Remember your leaders who have spoken to you the word of God; and considering the issue of their conversation, imitate their faith.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Jesus Christ [is] the same yesterday, and to-day, and to the ages [to come].</verse>
  <verse number="9">Be not carried away with various and strange doctrines; for [it is] good that the heart be confirmed with grace, not meats; those who have walked in which have not been profited by [them].</verse>
  <verse number="10">We have an altar of which they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle;</verse>
  <verse number="11">for of those beasts whose blood is carried [as sacrifices for sin] into the [holy of] holies by the high priest, of these the bodies are burned outside the camp.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Wherefore also Jesus, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the gate:</verse>
  <verse number="13">therefore let us go forth to him without the camp, bearing his reproach:</verse>
  <verse number="14">for we have not here an abiding city, but we seek the coming one.</verse>
  <verse number="15">By him therefore let us offer [the] sacrifice of praise continually to God, that is, [the] fruit of [the] lips confessing his name.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But of doing good and communicating [of your substance] be not forgetful, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Obey your leaders, and be submissive; for they watch over your souls as those that shall give account; that they may do this with joy, and not groaning, for this [would be] unprofitable for you.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Pray for us: for we persuade ourselves that we have a good conscience, in all things desirous to walk rightly.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But I much more beseech [you] to do this, that I may the more quickly be restored to you.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But the God of peace, who brought again from among [the] dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, in [the power of the] blood of [the] eternal covenant,</verse>
  <verse number="21">perfect you in every good work to the doing of his will, doing in you what is pleasing before him through Jesus Christ; to whom [be] glory for the ages of ages. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But I beseech you, brethren, bear the word of exhortation, for it is but in few words that I have written to you.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Know that our brother Timotheus is set at liberty; with whom, if he should come soon, I will see you.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Salute all your leaders, and all the saints. They from Italy salute you.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Grace [be] with you all. Amen.</verse>
