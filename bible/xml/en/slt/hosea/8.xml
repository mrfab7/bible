<chapter book="Hosea" number="8" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The trumpet to thy mouth: as an eagle upon the house of Jehovah, because they passed by my covenant and they transgressed against my laws.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Israel shall cry to me, My God, we knew thee.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Israel rejected the good: the enemy shall pursue him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">They made kings, and not from me: and they made princes, and I knew not: their silver and their gold they made to them images to cut off.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thy calf rejected, O Shomeron; mine anger was kindled against them: how long shall they not be able to be clean?</verse>
  <verse number="6">For from Israel, and this workman made it, and it is not God: for the calf of Shomeron shall be broken in pieces.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For they shall sow the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: no stalk to it: the sprout shall not make flour: perhaps it will make, strangers will swallow it down.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Israel was swallowed down: now they were among the nations as a vessel no delight in it.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For they went up to Assur, Ephraim a wild ass alone to himself: they hired those loving.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Also if they will hire among the nations, now will I gather them, and shall they be weak a little from the lifting up of the king of the princes.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Because Ephraim multiplied altars to sin, altars were to him to sin.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I will write to him his multitude of my instructions; they were reckoned as a strange thing.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The sacrifices of my gifts they will sacrifice flesh, and they will eat; Jehovah delighted not in them; now will he remember their iniquity, and he will review their sins: they shall turn back to Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Israel will forget him making him, and he will build temples; and Judah multiplied fortified cities: and I sent a fire upon his cities and it will consume its palaces.</verse>
