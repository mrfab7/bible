<chapter book="Proverbs" number="7" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Keep my commandments and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Bind them upon thy fingers; write them upon the table of thine heart.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:</verse>
  <verse number="5">That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice;</verse>
  <verse number="7">And I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,</verse>
  <verse number="8">Passing through the street near her corner, and he went the way to her house;</verse>
  <verse number="9">In the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the blackness of night and the darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and wily of heart.</verse>
  <verse number="11">She is clamorous, and wilful; her feet abide not in her house:</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, and lieth in wait at every corner.</verse>
  <verse number="13">So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face she said unto him:</verse>
  <verse number="14">Sacrifices of peace offerings are with me; this day have I paid my vows.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, with striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; let us solace ourselves with loves.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:</verse>
  <verse number="20">He hath taken a bag of money with him; he will come home at the full moon.</verse>
  <verse number="21">With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forceth him away.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as fetters to the correction of the fool;</verse>
  <verse number="23">Till an arrow strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me, and attend to the words of my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, all her slain are a mighty host.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.</verse>
