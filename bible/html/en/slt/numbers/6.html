<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Speak to the sons of Israel, and say to them, When a man or woman shall separate to vow a vow, being consecrated, to be separated to Jehovah:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">From wine and strong drink he shall be separated; vinegar of wine and vinegar of strong drink he shall not drip and the steeping of grapes he shall not drink, and grapes fresh and dry, he shall not eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">All the days of his consecration, from all which shall be made from the vine, of the wine, from the grape kernels, even to the skin, he shall not eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">All the days of the vow of his consecration a razor shall not pass over upon his head: till the filling up of the days which he shall consecrate to Jehovah, he shall be holy, increasing the locks of the hair of his head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">All the days of his consecrating himself to Jehovah, he shall not go in to a dead soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For his father, and for his mother, for his brother and for his sister, he shall not be defiled for them in their dying: for the consecration of his God upon his head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">All the days of his consecration he holy to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And when the dying shall die by him suddenly, in a moment, and the head of his consecration was defiled and he shaved his head in the day of his cleansing, in the seventh day shall he shave it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And in the eighth day he shall bring two turtle-doves, or two sons of the dove to the priest, to the door of the tent of appointment:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the priest did the one for sin, and one for a burnt-offering, and he expiated for him for what he sinned for the soul, and he consecrated his head in that day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And he consecrated to Jehovah the day of his consecration, and he brought a lamb, the son of a year, for trespass: and the former days shall fall because his consecration was defiled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And this the law of him consecrated: in the day of filling up the days of his consecration, he shall bring himself to the door of the tent of appointment:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he brought his offering to Jehovah, one blameless lamb, the son of his year, for a burnt-offering, and one blameless ewe lamb, the daughter of her year, for the sin, and one blameless ram for peace;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And a basket of unleavened of fine flour cakes mingled with oil, and thin unleavened cakes anointed with oil, and their gifts and their libations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the priest brought before Jehovah, and did his sin and his burnt-offering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the ram he shall do a sacrifice of peace to Jehovah, upon the basket of unleavened: and the priest did his gift and his libation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he being consecrated, shaved the head of his consecration at the door of the tent of appointment, and took the hair of the head of his consecration, and gave upon the fire which under the sacrifice of peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the priest took the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened cake from the basket, and one thin unleavened cake, and gave upon the hands of him consecrated, after his shaving his consecration.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the priest lifted them up a lifting up before Jehovah: it holy to the priest upon the breast of the lifting up and upon the leg of the offering: and afterwards, he being consecrated shall drink wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">This the law of him consecrated who shall vow his offering to Jehovah for his consecration, besides what his hand shall attain: according to his vow which he vowed, so shall he do according to the law of his consecration.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, So shall ye praise the sons of Israel, saying to them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Jehovah shall praise thee, and watch thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Jehovah shall make his face shine upon thee and shall compassionate thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Jehovah shall lift up his face to thee, and put peace to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And they put my name upon the sons of Israel and I will praise them.</p>
