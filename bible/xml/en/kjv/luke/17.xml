  <verse number="1">Then said he unto the disciples, It is impossible but that offences will come: but woe [unto him], through whom they come!</verse>
  <verse number="2">It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he cast into the sea, than that he should offend one of these little ones.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repent, forgive him.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And if he trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamine tree, Be thou plucked up by the root, and be thou planted in the sea; and it should obey you.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But which of you, having a servant plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, Go and sit down to meat?</verse>
  <verse number="8">And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself, and serve me, till I have eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Doth he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded him? I trow not.</verse>
  <verse number="10">So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off:</verse>
  <verse number="13">And they lifted up [their] voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And when he saw [them], he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,</verse>
  <verse number="16">And fell down on [his] face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where [are] the nine?</verse>
  <verse number="18">There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:</verse>
  <verse number="21">Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see [it].</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after [them], nor follow [them].</verse>
  <verse number="24">For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one [part] under heaven, shineth unto the other [part] under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.</verse>
  <verse number="27">They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded;</verse>
  <verse number="29">But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed [them] all.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.</verse>
  <verse number="31">In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Remember Lot’s wife.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.</verse>
  <verse number="34">I tell you, in that night there shall be two [men] in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Two [women] shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Two [men] shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body [is], thither will the eagles be gathered together.</verse>
