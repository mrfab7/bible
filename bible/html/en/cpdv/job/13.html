<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="13" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Behold, my eye has seen all these things, and my ear has heard, and I have understood each one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">In conformity with your knowledge, I also know. I am not inferior to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Yet I speak this way to the Almighty, and I desire to argue with God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">having first shown that you fabricate lies and cultivate perverse teachings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And I wish that you would remain silent, so that you would be counted among the wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Therefore, listen to my correction, and pay attention to the judgment of my lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Does God require your lie, so that you would speak deceitfully for him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Have you taken his place, and do you struggle to give judgment in favor of God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Or, will it please him, from whom nothing can be concealed? Or, will he be deceived, like a man, by your deceitfulness?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He will accuse you because in secret you have preempted his presence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">As soon as he moves himself, he will disturb you, and his dread will fall over you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Your remembrance will be compared to ashes, and your necks will be reduced to clay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Be silent for a little while, so that I may speak whatever my mind suggests to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Why do I wound my flesh with my teeth, and carry my soul in my hands?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And now, if he would kill me, I will hope in him; in this, truly, I will correct my ways in his sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he will be my savior, for no hypocrite at all will approach in his sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Listen to my words, and perceive an enigma with your ears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If I will be judged, I know that I will be found to be just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Who is it that will go to judgment with me? Let him approach. Why should I be consumed in silence?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Do not do such things to me twice, and then I will not hide from your face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Take your hand far away from me, and do not let your dread terrify me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Call me, and I will answer you, or else I will speak, and you can answer me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">How many iniquities and sins do I have? Reveal my crimes and offenses to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Why do you conceal your face and consider me to be your enemy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Against a leaf, which is carried away by the wind, you reveal your power, and you pursue dry straw.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For you write bitter things against me, and you want to consume me for the sins of my youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">You have put my feet on a tether, and you have observed all my paths, and you have considered the steps of my feet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">I will be left to decay like something rotten and like a garment that is being eaten by moths.</p>
