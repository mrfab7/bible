<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And a great sign appeared in heaven: A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And being with child, she cried travailing in birth, and was in pain to be delivered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And there was seen another sign in heaven: and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads, and ten horns: and on his head seven diadems:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered; that, when she should be delivered, he might devour her son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with an iron rod: and her son was taken up to God, and to his throne.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared by God, that there they should feed her a thousand two hundred sixty days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And there was a great battle in heaven, Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon fought and his angels:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And they prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, who seduceth the whole world; and he was cast unto the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying: Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: because the accuser of our brethren is cast forth, who accused them before our God day and night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of the testimony, and they loved not their lives unto death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you that dwell therein. Woe to the earth, and to the sea, because the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a short time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman, who brought forth the man child:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the desert unto her place, where she is nourished for a time and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman, water as it were a river; that he might cause her to be carried away by the river.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the river, which the dragon cast out of his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the dragon was angry against the woman: and went to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>
