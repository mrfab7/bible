<p class="verse" data-verse="1">In that day shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for putting away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it was in that day, says Jehovah of armies, I will cut off the names of the images from the land, and they shall be remembered no more: and also I will cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And it was if a man shall yet prophesy, and his father and his mother who begat him, said to him, Thou shalt not live, for thou spakest falsehood in the name of Jehovah: and his father and his mother begetting him thrust him through in his prophesying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And it was in that day the prophets shall be ashamed, each of his vision, in his prophesying; and they shall not put on a mantle of hair to speak lies:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And saying, I am not a prophet; I a man working the land; for man sold me from my youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And saying to him, What these wounds between thy hands? And he said, Which I was struck in the house of those loving me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">O sword, be raised up against my shepherd, and against the man of my fellowship, says Jehovah of armies: strike the shepherd and the sheep shall be scattered; and I turned back my hand upon the little ones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And it was in all the land, says Jehovah, two parts in it shall be cut off, they shall expire; and the third shall be left in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And I brought the third through fire, and I purified them as purifying silver, and I tried them as trying gold: he shall call on my name and I will answer him: I said, He is my people; and he shall say, Jehovah my God.</p>
