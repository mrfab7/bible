  <verse number="1">Then Solomon began to build the house of Yahweh at Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where Yahweh appeared to David his father, which he prepared in the place that David had appointed, in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</verse>
  <verse number="2">He began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.</verse>

  <verse number="4">The porch that was in front, its length, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and the height one hundred twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The greater house he made a ceiling with fir wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and ornamented it with palm trees and chains.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He garnished the house with precious stones for beauty: and the gold was gold of Parvaim.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He overlaid also the house, the beams, the thresholds, and its walls, and its doors, with gold; and engraved cherubim on the walls.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He made the most holy house: its length, according to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and its breadth twenty cubits; and he overlaid it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. He overlaid the upper rooms with gold.</verse>
  <verse number="10">In the most holy house he made two cherubim of image work; and they overlaid them with gold.</verse>

  <verse number="12">The wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits, joining to the wing of the other cherub.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were toward the house.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He made the veil of blue, and purple, and crimson, and fine linen, and ornamented it with cherubim.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty-five cubits high, and the capital that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.</verse>
  <verse number="16">He made chains in the oracle, and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made one hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He set up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the left Boaz.</verse>
