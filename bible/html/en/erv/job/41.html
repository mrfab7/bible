<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="41" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Canst thou draw out leviathan with a fish hook? or press down his tongue with a cord?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Canst thou put a rope into his nose? or pierce his jaw through with a hook?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Will he make many supplications unto thee? or will he speak soft words unto thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Will he make a covenant with thee, that thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Shall the bands of fishermen make traffic of him? shall they part him among the merchants?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons, or his head with fish spears?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Lay thine hand upon him; remember the battle, and do so no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">None is so fierce that he dare stir him up: who then is he that can stand before me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Who hath first given unto me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, nor his mighty strength, nor his comely proportion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who can strip off his outer garment? who shall come within his double bridle?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Who can open the doors of his face? round about his teeth is terror.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">His strong scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">They are joined one to another; they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">His neesings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Out of his mouth go burning torches, and sparks of fire leap forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Out of his nostrils a smoke goeth, as of a seething pot and burning rushes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth forth from his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">In his neck abideth strength, and terror danceth before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm upon him; they cannot be moved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, firm as the nether millstone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">When he raiseth himself up, the mighty are afraid: by reason of consternation they are beside themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">If one lay at him with the sword, it cannot avail; nor the spear, the dart, nor the pointed shaft.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He counteth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Clubs are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the rushing of the javelin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">His underparts are like sharp potsherds: he spreadeth as it were a threshing wain upon the mire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like ointment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Upon earth there is not his like, that is made without fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">He beholdeth every thing that is high: he is king over all the sons of pride.</p>
