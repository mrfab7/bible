  <verse number="1">And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Son of man, because that Tyrus has said against Jerusalem, Aha, she is broken that was the gates of the people: she is turned to me: I shall be replenished, now she is laid waste:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against you, O Tyrus, and will cause many nations to come up against you, as the sea causes his waves to come up.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.</verse>
  <verse number="5">It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the middle of the sea: for I have spoken it, said the Lord GOD: and it shall become a spoil to the nations.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And her daughters which are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring on Tyrus Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses, and with chariots, and with horsemen, and companies, and much people.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He shall slay with the sword your daughters in the field: and he shall make a fort against you, and cast a mount against you, and lift up the buckler against you.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he shall set engines of war against your walls, and with his axes he shall break down your towers.</verse>
  <verse number="10">By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover you: your walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen, and of the wheels, and of the chariots, when he shall enter into your gates, as men enter into a city wherein is made a breach.</verse>
  <verse number="11">With the hoofs of his horses shall he tread down all your streets: he shall slay your people by the sword, and your strong garrisons shall go down to the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they shall make a spoil of your riches, and make a prey of your merchandise: and they shall break down your walls, and destroy your pleasant houses: and they shall lay your stones and your timber and your dust in the middle of the water.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And I will cause the noise of your songs to cease; and the sound of your harps shall be no more heard.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And I will make you like the top of a rock: you shall be a place to spread nets on; you shall be built no more: for I the LORD have spoken it, said the Lord GOD.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Thus said the Lord GOD to Tyrus; Shall not the isles shake at the sound of your fall, when the wounded cry, when the slaughter is made in the middle of you?</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones, and lay away their robes, and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit on the ground, and shall tremble at every moment, and be astonished at you.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And they shall take up a lamentation for you, and say to you, How are you destroyed, that were inhabited of seafaring men, the renowned city, which were strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, which cause their terror to be on all that haunt it!</verse>
  <verse number="18">Now shall the isles tremble in the day of your fall; yes, the isles that are in the sea shall be troubled at your departure.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For thus said the Lord GOD; When I shall make you a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; when I shall bring up the deep on you, and great waters shall cover you;</verse>
  <verse number="20">When I shall bring you down with them that descend into the pit, with the people of old time, and shall set you in the low parts of the earth, in places desolate of old, with them that go down to the pit, that you be not inhabited; and I shall set glory in the land of the living;</verse>
  <verse number="21">I will make you a terror, and you shall be no more: though you be sought for, yet shall you never be found again, said the Lord GOD.</verse>
