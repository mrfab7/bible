<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Son of man, What is the vine-tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Shall wood be taken of it to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel upon it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it suitable for any work?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Behold, when it was whole, it was fit for no work: how much less then shall it be fit for any work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine-tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
