  <verse number="1">And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, [even] as unto babes in Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able [to bear it], neither yet now are ye able.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For ye are yet carnal: for whereas [there is] among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</verse>
  <verse number="4">For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I [am] of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Who then is Paul, and who [is] Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</verse>
  <verse number="6">I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</verse>
  <verse number="7">So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s husbandry, [ye are] God’s building.</verse>
  <verse number="10">According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</verse>
  <verse number="13">Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is.</verse>
  <verse number="14">If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</verse>
  <verse number="15">If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and [that] the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</verse>
  <verse number="17">If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which [temple] ye are.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;</verse>
  <verse number="22">Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</verse>
  <verse number="23">And ye are Christ’s; and Christ [is] God’s.</verse>
