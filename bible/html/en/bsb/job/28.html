<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="28" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“Surely there is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Iron is taken from the earth, and copper is smelted from ore.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Man puts an end to the darkness; he probes the farthest recesses for ore in deepest darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Far from human habitation he cuts a shaft in places forgotten by the foot of man. Far from men he dangles and sways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Food may come from the earth, but from below it is transformed as by fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Its rocks are the source of sapphires, containing flecks of gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">No bird of prey knows that path; no falcon’s eye has seen it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Proud beasts have never trodden it; no lion has ever prowled over it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The miner strikes the flint; he overturns mountains at their base.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He hews out channels in the rocks, and his eyes spot every treasure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He stops up the sources of the streams to bring what is hidden to light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But where can wisdom be found, and where does understanding dwell?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">No man can know its value, nor is it found in the land of the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The ocean depths say, ‘It is not in me,’ while the sea declares, ‘It is not with me.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">It cannot be bought with gold, nor can its price be weighed out in silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx or sapphire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Neither gold nor crystal can compare to it, nor jewels of fine gold be exchanged for it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Coral and quartz are unworthy of mention; the price of wisdom is beyond rubies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Topaz from Cush cannot compare to it, nor can it be valued in pure gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">From where, then, does wisdom come, and where does understanding dwell?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing and concealed from the birds of the air.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Abaddon and Death say, ‘We have heard a rumor about it.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But God understands its way, and He knows its place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For He looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">When God fixed the weight of the wind and measured out the waters,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">when He set a limit for the rain and a path for the thunderbolt,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">then He looked at wisdom and appraised it; He established it and searched it out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And He said to man, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding.’”</p>
