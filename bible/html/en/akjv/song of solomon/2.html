<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">His left hand is under my head, and his right hand does embrace me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I charge you, O you daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that you stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The voice of my beloved! behold, he comes leaping on the mountains, skipping on the hills.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he stands behind our wall, he looks forth at the windows, showing himself through the lattice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">My beloved spoke, and said to me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For, see, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The fig tree puts forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">O my dove, that are in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see your countenance, let me hear your voice; for sweet is your voice, and your countenance is comely.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feeds among the lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be you like a roe or a young hart on the mountains of Bether.</p>
