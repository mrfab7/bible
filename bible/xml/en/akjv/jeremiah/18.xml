<chapter book="Jeremiah" number="18" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Arise, and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause you to hear my words.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then I went down to the potter’s house, and, behold, he worked a work on the wheels.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="6">O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? said the LORD. Behold, as the clay is in the potter’s hand, so are you in my hand, O house of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="7">At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it;</verse>
  <verse number="8">If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it;</verse>
  <verse number="10">If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, with which I said I would benefit them.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus said the LORD; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return you now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Therefore thus said the LORD; Ask you now among the heathen, who has heard such things: the virgin of Israel has done a very horrible thing.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which comes from the rock of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Because my people has forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up;</verse>
  <verse number="16">To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passes thereby shall be astonished, and wag his head.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Then said they, Come and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Give heed to me, O LORD, and listen to the voice of them that contend with me.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have dig a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before you to speak good for them, and to turn away your wrath from them.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their blood by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and be widows; and let their men be put to death; let their young men be slain by the sword in battle.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Let a cry be heard from their houses, when you shall bring a troop suddenly on them: for they have dig a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Yet, LORD, you know all their counsel against me to slay me: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from your sight, but let them be overthrown before you; deal thus with them in the time of your anger.</verse>
