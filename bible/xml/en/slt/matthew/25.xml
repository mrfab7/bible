  <verse number="1">Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened to ten virgins, who having taken their lanterns, went forth to the meeting of the bridegroom.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And five of them were discerning, and five foolish.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Those foolish having taken their lanterns, took no oil with them.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the discerning took oil in their vessels with their lanterns.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the bridegroom delaying, they all slumbered and slept.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And in the middle of the night there was a cry, Behold, the bridegroom comes; go ye forth to his meeting.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Then all these virgins were aroused, and put their lanterns in order.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the foolish said to the discerning, Give us of your oil; for our lights are quenched.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the discerning answered, saying, Lest it should not suffice us and you: but go ye rather to those selling, and buy for yourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they, going to buy, the bridegroom came; and they prepared, went in with him to the nuptials; and the door was locked.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And afterwards came also the rest of the virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he having answered said, Truly I say to you, I know you not.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Watch, therefore, for ye know not the day, neither the hour, in which the Son of man comes.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For as a man going abroad, called his own servants, and delivered them his possessions:</verse>
  <verse number="15">And to one he truly gave five talents, and to one, two, and to one, one; to each according to his own power; and he quickly went abroad.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he having received five talents, having gone, worked with them, and he made other five talents.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Likewise he having the two also, gained he also other two.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he having received one, having departed, dug in the earth, and concealed his lord’s silver.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And after much time the lord of these servants comes, and lifts up the word with them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he having received the five talents, having come near, brought the other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst me five talents: and I have gained other five talents.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And his lord said to him, Well, good and faithful servant: thou west faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many; enter into the joy of thy lord.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he also having received the two talents, having come near said, Lord, thou deliveredst me two talents; see, I gained two other talents to them.</verse>
  <verse number="23">His lord said to him, Well, good and faithful servant; thou wast faithful over a few things, I will set thee over many; enter into the joy of thy lord.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And he also having received one talent, having come near, said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou sowedst not, and gathering where thou scatteredst not:</verse>
  <verse number="25">And having been afraid, having gone away, I concealed thy talent in the earth; see, thou hast thine own.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And his lord having answered, said to him, O evil and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I scattered not:</verse>
  <verse number="27">Thou therefore oughtest to have cast my silver to the money-changers, and I having come, had received mine own, with interest.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Therefore take the talent away from him, and give him having ten talents.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For to every one having shall be given, and he shall be in abundance: and from him not having, also what he has shall be taken away from him.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And cast ye the useless servant into darkness without; weeping shall be there, and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And when the Son of man should come in his glory, and all his holy messengers with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</verse>
  <verse number="32">And all nations shall be gathered together before him, and he shall separate them from one another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the kids.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And he shall set the sheep from his right, and the kids from his left.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Then shall the king say to them from his right, Come, the praised of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</verse>
  <verse number="35">For I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me to drink: I was a stranger, and ye brought me in:</verse>
  <verse number="36">Naked, and ye put around me: I was sick, and ye reviewed me: I was in prison, and ye came to me.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Then shall the just answer him saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungering, and nourished or thirsting, and gave to drink.</verse>
  <verse number="38">And when saw we thee a stranger, and brought in or naked, and put around.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came to thee?</verse>
  <verse number="40">And the king having answered, will say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as ye did to one of the least of my brethren, ye did to me.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Then shall he say to them from the left, Go away from me, the cursed, into eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his messengers:</verse>
  <verse number="42">For I was hungry, and ye gave me not to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;</verse>
  <verse number="43">I was a stranger and ye brought me not in; naked, and ye put not around me; sick, and in prison, and ye took not a view of me.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Then shall they answer him, they also saying, Lord, when saw we thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and attended not to thee?</verse>
  <verse number="45">Then shall he answer them saying, Inasmuch as ye did not to one of the least of these, ye did not to me.</verse>
  <verse number="46">And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: and the just into eternal life.</verse>
