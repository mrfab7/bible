<chapter book="1 Thessalonians" number="5" translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" translationID="jps" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But as to times and dates it is unnecessary that anything be written to you.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For you yourselves know perfectly well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.</verse>
  <verse number="3">While they are saying “Peace and safety!” then in a moment destruction falls upon them, like birth-pains on a woman who is with child; and escape there is none.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that daylight should surprise you like a thief;</verse>
  <verse number="5">for all of you are sons of Light and sons of the day. We belong neither to the night nor to darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="6">So then let us not sleep, like the rest of the world, but let us keep awake and be sober.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who drink freely, drink at night.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But let us, belonging—as we do—to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For God has not pre-destined us to meet His anger, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="10">who died on our behalf, so that whether we are awake or are sleeping we may share His Life.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Therefore encourage one another, and let each one help to strengthen his friend, as in fact you do.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now we beg you, brethren, to show respect for those who labour among you and are your leaders in Christian work, and are your advisers;</verse>
  <verse number="13">and to esteem them very highly in love for their work’s sake. Be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And we exhort you, brethren, admonish the unruly, comfort the timid, sustain the weak, and be patient towards all.</verse>
  <verse number="15">See to it that no one ever repays another with evil for evil; but always seek opportunities of doing good both to one another and to all the world.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Be always joyful.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Be unceasing in prayer.</verse>
  <verse number="18">In every circumstance of life be thankful; for this is God’s will in Christ Jesus respecting you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Do not quench the Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Do not think meanly of utterances of prophecy;</verse>
  <verse number="21">but test all such, and retain hold of the good.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Hold yourselves aloof from every form of evil.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And may God Himself who gives peace, make you entirely holy; and may your spirits, souls and bodies be preserved complete and be found blameless at the Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Faithful is He who calls you, and He will also perfect His work.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Brethren, pray for us.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.</verse>
  <verse number="27">I solemnly charge you in the Lord’s name to have this Letter read to all the brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="28">May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</verse>
