<div class="chapter" data-book="Philemon" data-chapter="1" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow-worker,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and to Apphia our sister, and to Archippus our fellow-soldier, and to the church in thy house:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I thank my God always, making mention of thee in my prayers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">hearing of thy love, and of the faith which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all the saints;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">that the fellowship of thy faith may become effectual, in the knowledge of every good thing which is in you, unto Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For I had much joy and comfort in thy love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through thee, brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Wherefore, though I have all boldness in Christ to enjoin thee that which is befitting,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">yet for loveâ€™s sake I rather beseech, being such a one as Paul the aged, and now a prisoner also of Christ Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I beseech thee for my child, whom I have begotten in my bonds, Onesimus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">who was aforetime unprofitable to thee, but now is profitable to thee and to me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">whom I have sent back to thee in his own person, that is, my very heart:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">whom I would fain have kept with me, that in thy behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">but without thy mind I would do nothing; that thy goodness should not be as of necessity, but of free will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For perhaps he was therefore parted from thee for a season, that thou shouldest have him for ever;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">no longer as a servant, but more than a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much rather to thee, both in the flesh and in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If then thou countest me a partner, receive him as myself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But if he hath wronged thee at all, or oweth thee aught, put that to mine account;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I Paul write it with mine own hand, I will repay it: that I say not unto thee how that thou owest to me even thine own self besides.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my heart in Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Having confidence in thine obedience I write unto thee, knowing that thou wilt do even beyond what I say.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I hope that through your prayers I shall be granted unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Epaphras, my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus, saluteth thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, Luke, my fellow-workers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
