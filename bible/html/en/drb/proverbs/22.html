<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Incline thy ear, and hear the words of the wise: and apply thy heart to my doctrine :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Which shall be beautiful for thee, if thou keep it in thy bowels, and it shall flow in thy lips:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">That thy trust may be in the Lord, wherefore I have also shewn it to thee this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Behold I have described it to thee three manner of ways, in thoughts and knowledge :</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Hast thou seen a man swift in his work? he shall stand before kings, and shall not be before those that are obscure.</p>
