<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah the second time, and he yet shut up in the enclosure of the prison, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thus said Jehovah making it Jehovah forming it, to prepare it, Jehovah his name:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Call to me and I will answer thee, and I will announce to thee great and mighty things which thou knewest them not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, being torn away to the mounds and to the sword;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Coming to war with the Chaldeans, and to fill them with the corpses of man whom I struck in mine anger and in my wrath, and that I hid my face from this city for all their wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Behold me bringing up to it health and healing, and healing them, and I uncovered to them the abundance of peace and truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I turned back the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel and I built them as at the first.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And I cleansed them from all their iniquity which they sinned to me, and which they transgressed against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And it was to me for a name of joy, for a praise and for an honor to all the nations of the earth who shall hear all the good which I did them: and they trembled and were moved for all the good and for all the peace which I did to it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thus said Jehovah: Yet shall be heard in this place which ye were saying it was laid waste without man and without cattle, in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, being desolate without man and without inhabitant, and without cattle,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those saying, Praise ye Jehovah of armies: for Jehovah is good, for his mercy is forever: of them bringing thanksgiving to the house of Jehovah; for I will turn back the captivity of the land as at the first, said Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Thus said Jehovah of armies: Yet shall be in this place being laid waste without man and without cattle, and in all its cities, the habitation of the shepherds causing the sheep to lie down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">In the cities of the mountain, in the cities of the low country, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in round about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the sheep yet pass through upon the hand of him numbering, said Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Behold, the days coming, says Jehovah, and I raised up the good word which I spake to the house of Israel and for the house of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">In those days and in that time I will cause the sprout of justice to spring up to David; and he did judgment and justice in the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell with confidence; and this is what shall be called to her: Jehovah our Justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For thus said Jehovah, I will not cut off to David a man sitting upon the throne of the house of Israel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And to the priests, the Levites, I will not cut off a man from my face bringing up burnt-offerings, and burning the gift, and doing sacrifice all the days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Thus said Jehovah, If ye shall break my covenant of the day and my covenant of the night, and there was not day and night in their season;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Also my covenant shall be broken with David ray servant from there being to him a son reigning upon his throne; and with the Levites, the priests, from serving me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">As the army of the heavens shall not be numbered and the sand of the sea shall not be measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites serving me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And the word of Jehovah will be to Jeremiah, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Sawest thou not what this people spake, saying, The two families which Jehovah chose in them, and he will reject them? and they will despise my people from being yet a nation before them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Thus said Jehovah, If not my covenant of the day and of the night, the laws of the heavens and the earth I set not up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Also the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, will I reject from taking from his seed those ruling over the seed of Abraham, Isaak, and Jacob for I will turn back their captivity, and I compassionated them.</p>
