1	Moreover Elihu answered and said:
2	Thinkest thou this to be thy right, Or sayest thou: ‘I am righteousness before God’,
3	That thou inquirest: ‘What advantage will it be unto Thee?’ And: ‘What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?’
4	I will give thee answer, And thy companions with thee.
5	Look unto the heavens, and see; And behold the skies, which are higher than thou.
6	If thou hast sinned, what doest thou against Him? And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto Him?
7	If thou be righteous, what givest thou Him? Or what receiveth He of thy hand?
8	Thy wickedness concerneth a man as thou art; And thy righteousness a son of man.
9	By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.
10	But none saith: ‘Where is God my Maker, Who giveth songs in the night;
11	Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, And maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?’
12	There they cry, but none giveth answer, Because of the pride of evil men.
13	Surely God will not hear vanity, Neither will the Almighty regard it.
14	Yea, when thou sayest thou canst not see Him—The cause is before Him; therefore wait thou for Him.
15	And now, is it for nought that He punished in His anger? And hath He not full knowledge of arrogance?
16	But Job doth open his mouth in vanity; He multiplieth words without knowledge.
