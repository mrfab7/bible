1	Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.
2	There is nought but swearing and breaking faith, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery; they break out, and blood toucheth blood.
3	Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field and the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.
4	Yet let no man strive, neither let any man reprove; for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.
5	And thou shalt stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night; and I will destroy thy mother.
6	My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.
7	As they were multiplied, so they sinned against me: I will change their glory into shame.
8	They feed on the sin of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity.
9	And it shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and will reward them their doings.
10	And they shall eat, and not have enough; they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.
11	Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the understanding.
12	My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredom hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.
13	They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and terebinths, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters commit whoredom, and your brides commit adultery.
14	I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your brides when they commit adultery; for they themselves go apart with whores, and they sacrifice with the harlots: and the people that doth not understand shall be overthrown.
15	Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, As the LORD liveth.
16	For Israel hath behaved himself stubbornly, like a stubborn heifer: now will the LORD feed them as a lamb in a large place.
17	Ephraim is joined to idols; let him alone.
18	Their drink is become sour: they commit whoredom continually; her rulers dearly love shame.
19	The wind hath wrapped her up in its wings; and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
