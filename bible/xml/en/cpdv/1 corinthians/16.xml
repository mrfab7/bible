<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="16" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now concerning the collections which are made for the saints: just as I have arranged for the churches of Galatia, so should it also be done with you.</verse>
  <verse number="2">On the first day of the week, the Sabbath, let each one of you take from himself, setting aside what will be well-pleasing to him, so that when I arrive, the collections will not have to be made then.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And when I am present, whomever you shall approve through letters, these I shall send to bear your gifts to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And if it is fitting for me to go too, they shall go with me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now I will visit you after I have passed through Macedonia. For I will pass through Macedonia.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And perhaps I will stay with you, and even spend the winter, so that you may lead me on my way, whenever I depart.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For I am not willing to see you now only in passing, since I hope that I may remain with you for some length of time, if the Lord permits.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But I must remain at Ephesus, even until Pentecost.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For a door, great and unavoidable, has opened to me, as well as many adversaries.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Now if Timothy arrives, see to it that he may be among you without fear. For he is doing the work of the Lord, just as I also do.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Therefore, let no one despise him. Instead, lead him on his way in peace, so that he may come to me. For I am awaiting him with the brothers.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But concerning our brother, Apollo, I am letting you know that I pleaded with him greatly to go to you with the brothers, and clearly it was not his will to go at this time. But he will arrive when there is a space of time for him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Be vigilant. Stand with faith. Act manfully and be strengthened.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Let all that is yours be immersed in charity.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And I beg you, brothers: You know the house of Stephanus, and of Fortunatus, and of Achaicus, that they are the first-fruits of Achaia, and that they have dedicated themselves to the ministry of the saints.</verse>
  <verse number="16">So you should be subject also to persons such as this, as well as to all who are cooperating and working with them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Now I rejoice in the presence of Stephanus and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because what was lacking in you, they have supplied.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For they have refreshed my spirit and yours. Therefore, recognize persons such as this.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The churches of Asia greet you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you greatly in the Lord, with the church of their household, where I also am a guest.</verse>
  <verse number="20">All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</verse>
  <verse number="21">This is a greeting from my own hand, Paul.</verse>
  <verse number="22">If anyone does not love our Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema! Maran Atha.</verse>
  <verse number="23">May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.</verse>
  <verse number="24">My charity is with all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.</verse>
