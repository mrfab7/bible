<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="25" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Also these are Proverbs of Solomon, that men of Hezekiah king of Judah transcribed:—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The honour of God is to hide a thing, And the honour of kings to search out a matter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The heavens for height, and the earth for depth, And the heart of kings—are unsearchable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Take away dross from silver, And a vessel for the refiner goeth forth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Take away the wicked before a king, And established in righteousness is his throne.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Honour not thyself before a king, And in the place of the great stand not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For better that he hath said to thee, ‘Come thou up hither,’ Than that he humble thee before a noble, Whom thine eyes have seen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Go not forth to strive, haste, turn, What dost thou in its latter end, When thy neighbour causeth thee to blush?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Thy cause plead with thy neighbour, And the secret counsel of another reveal not,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Lest the hearer put thee to shame, And thine evil report turn not back.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Apples of gold in imagery of silver, Is the word spoken at its fit times.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A ring of gold, and an ornament of pure gold, Is the wise reprover to an attentive ear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">As a vessel of snow in a day of harvest, So is a faithful ambassador to those sending him, And the soul of his masters he refresheth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Clouds and wind, and rain there is none, Is a man boasting himself in a false gift.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">By long-suffering is a ruler persuaded, And a soft tongue breaketh a bone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Honey thou hast found—eat thy sufficiency, Lest thou be satiated with it, and hast vomited it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour’s house, Lest he be satiated with thee, and have hated thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">A maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow, Is the man testifying against his neighbour a false testimony.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A bad tooth, and a tottering foot, Is the confidence of the treacherous in a day of adversity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Whoso is taking away a garment in a cold day, Is as vinegar on nitre, And a singer of songs on a sad heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">If he who is hating thee doth hunger, cause him to eat bread, And if he thirst, cause him to drink water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For coals thou art putting on his head, And Jehovah giveth recompense to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">A north wind bringeth forth rain, And a secret tongue—indignant faces.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Better to sit on a corner of a roof, Than with a woman of contentions, and a house of company.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">As cold waters for a weary soul, So is a good report from a far country.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">A spring troubled, and a fountain corrupt, Is the righteous falling before the wicked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The eating of much honey is not good, Nor a searching out of one’s own honour—honour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A city broken down without walls, Is a man without restraint over his spirit!</p>
