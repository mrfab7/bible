<chapter book="Job" number="5" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">“Call now; is there any who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?</verse>
  <verse number="2">For resentment kills the foolish man, and jealousy kills the simple.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I have seen the foolish taking root, but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</verse>
  <verse number="4">His children are far from safety. They are crushed in the gate. Neither is there any to deliver them,</verse>
  <verse number="5">whose harvest the hungry eats up, and take it even out of the thorns. The snare gapes for their substance.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For affliction doesn’t come forth from the dust, neither does trouble spring out of the ground;</verse>
  <verse number="7">but man is born to trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</verse>
  <verse number="8">“But as for me, I would seek God. I would commit my cause to God,</verse>
  <verse number="9">who does great things that can’t be fathomed, marvelous things without number;</verse>
  <verse number="10">who gives rain on the earth, and sends waters on the fields;</verse>
  <verse number="11">so that he sets up on high those who are low, those who mourn are exalted to safety.</verse>
  <verse number="12">He frustrates the devices of the crafty, So that their hands can’t perform their enterprise.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He takes the wise in their own craftiness; the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.</verse>
  <verse number="14">They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope at noonday as in the night.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But he saves from the sword of their mouth, even the needy from the hand of the mighty.</verse>
  <verse number="16">So the poor has hope, and injustice shuts her mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">“Behold, happy is the man whom God corrects. Therefore do not despise the chastening of the Almighty.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For he wounds, and binds up. He injures, and his hands make whole.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He will deliver you in six troubles; yes, in seven no evil shall touch you.</verse>
  <verse number="20">In famine he will redeem you from death; in war, from the power of the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="21">You shall be hidden from the scourge of the tongue, neither shall you be afraid of destruction when it comes.</verse>
  <verse number="22">At destruction and famine you shall laugh, neither shall you be afraid of the animals of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For you shall be allied with the stones of the field. The animals of the field shall be at peace with you.</verse>
  <verse number="24">You shall know that your tent is in peace. You shall visit your fold, and shall miss nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="25">You shall know also that your seed shall be great, Your offspring as the grass of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="26">You shall come to your grave in a full age, like a shock of grain comes in its season.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Look this, we have searched it, so it is. Hear it, and know it for your good.”</verse>
