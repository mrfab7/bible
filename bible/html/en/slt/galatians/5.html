<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Therefore in the liberty which Christ has freed us, stand ye, and be not again held in the yoke of servitude.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Behold, I Paul say to you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And again to any man circumcised, I testify, that he is debtor to do the whole law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Ye were neglected from Christ, whoever are justified in the law; ye have fallen from grace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For we in spirit by faith expect the hope of justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any power, nor uncircumcision; but faith being energetic through love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Ye were running well; who hindered you not to obey the truth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The confidence not from him calling you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">A little leaven leavens the whole mixture.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I have trusted to you in the Lord, that ye will have nothing different in mind; and he troubling you shall bear judgment, whoever he be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And I, brethren, if I yet proclaim circumcision, why am I. yet driven out? therefore the offence of the cross is left unemployed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I would also they shall be cut off who having risen up against you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For ye were called to liberty brethren; only not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but through love serve ye one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For all the law is completed in one word, in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And if ye bite and devour one another, see ye that ye be not laid waste by one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And I say, Walk in Spirit, and complete not the desire of the flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the flesh desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are adverse to one another: that not the things ye would, these should ye do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the works of the flesh are manifest, which are; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, licentiousness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Idolatry, charm, enmities, strifes, jealousies, wraths, intriguings, seditions, sects.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Envyings, slaughters, drunkenness, revelries, and the like: to these which I foretell you, as I have also said before, that they doing such shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faith,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Meekness, temperance: against such is no law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And they of Christ have crucified the flesh with the passions and desires.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Let us not be vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.</p>
