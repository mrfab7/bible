<p class="verse" data-verse="1">These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The descendants of Jacob numbered seventy in all, including Joseph, who was already in Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">but the Israelites were fruitful and increased rapidly; they multiplied and became exceedingly numerous, so that the land was filled with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then a new king, who did not know Joseph, came to power in Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">“Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become too numerous and too powerful for us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, or they will increase even more; and if a war breaks out, they may join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the country.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">So the Egyptians appointed taskmasters over the Israelites to oppress them with forced labor. As a result, they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and flourished; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They worked the Israelites ruthlessly</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">and made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar, and with all kinds of work in the fields. Every service they imposed was harsh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">“When you help the Hebrew women give birth, observe them on the birthstools. If the child is a son, kill him; but if it is a daughter, let her live.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The midwives, however, feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt had instructed; they let the boys live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The midwives answered Pharaoh, “The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before a midwife arrives.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">So God was good to the midwives, and the people multiplied and became even more numerous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And because the midwives feared God, He gave them families of their own.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Then Pharaoh commanded all his people: “Every son born to the Hebrews you must throw into the Nile, but every daughter you may allow to live.”</p>
