  <verse number="1">The whole company of them rose up and brought him before Pilate.</verse>
  <verse number="2">They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man perverting the nation, forbidding paying taxes to Caesar, and saying that he himself is Christ, a king.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” He answered him, “So you say.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitudes, “I find no basis for a charge against this man.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">But they insisted, saying, “He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee even to this place.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">But when Pilate heard Galilee mentioned, he asked if the man was a Galilean.</verse>
  <verse number="7">When he found out that he was in Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem during those days.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad, for he had wanted to see him for a long time, because he had heard many things about him. He hoped to see some miracle done by him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He questioned him with many words, but he gave no answers.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The chief priests and the scribes stood, vehemently accusing him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Herod with his soldiers humiliated him and mocked him. Dressing him in luxurious clothing, they sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day, for before that they were enemies with each other.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</verse>
  <verse number="14">and said to them, “You brought this man to me as one that perverts the people, and see, I have examined him before you, and found no basis for a charge against this man concerning those things of which you accuse him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Neither has Herod, for I sent you to him, and see, nothing worthy of death has been done by him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I will therefore chastise him and release him.”</verse>
  <verse number="17">Now he had to release one prisoner to them at the feast.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But they all cried out together, saying, “Away with this man! Release to us Barabbas!”—</verse>
  <verse number="19">one who was thrown into prison for a certain revolt in the city, and for murder.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Then Pilate spoke to them again, wanting to release Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="21">but they shouted, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!”</verse>
  <verse number="22">He said to them the third time, “Why? What evil has this man done? I have found no capital crime in him. I will therefore chastise him and release him.”</verse>
  <verse number="23">But they were urgent with loud voices, asking that he might be crucified. Their voices and the voices of the chief priests prevailed.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Pilate decreed that what they asked for should be done.</verse>
  <verse number="25">He released him who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder, for whom they asked, but he delivered Jesus up to their will.</verse>
  <verse number="26">When they led him away, they grabbed one Simon of Cyrene, coming from the country, and laid on him the cross, to carry it after Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="27">A great multitude of the people followed him, including women who also mourned and lamented him.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But Jesus, turning to them, said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, don’t weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’</verse>
  <verse number="30">Then they will begin to tell the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and tell the hills, ‘Cover us.’</verse>
  <verse number="31">For if they do these things in the green tree, what will be done in the dry?”</verse>
  <verse number="32">There were also others, two criminals, led with him to be put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="33">When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on the right and the other on the left.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they don’t know what they are doing.” Dividing his garments among them, they cast lots.</verse>
  <verse number="35">The people stood watching. The rulers with them also scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself, if this is the Christ of God, his chosen one!”</verse>
  <verse number="36">The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,</verse>
  <verse number="37">and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!”</verse>
  <verse number="38">An inscription was also written over him in letters of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew: “THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.”</verse>
  <verse number="39">One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, “If you are the Christ, save yourself and us!”</verse>
  <verse number="40">But the other answered, and rebuking him said, “Don’t you even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?</verse>
  <verse number="41">And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.”</verse>
  <verse number="42">He said to Jesus, “Lord, remember me when you come into your Kingdom.”</verse>
  <verse number="43">Jesus said to him, “Assuredly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”</verse>
  <verse number="44">It was now about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
  <verse number="45">The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.</verse>
  <verse number="46">Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, “Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!” Having said this, he breathed his last.</verse>
  <verse number="47">When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly this was a righteous man.”</verse>
  <verse number="48">All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw the things that were done, returned home beating their breasts.</verse>
  <verse number="49">All his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</verse>
  <verse number="50">Behold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council, a good and righteous man</verse>
  <verse number="51">(he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea, a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for the Kingdom of God:</verse>
  <verse number="52">this man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body.</verse>
  <verse number="53">He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid.</verse>
  <verse number="54">It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near.</verse>
  <verse number="55">The women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after, and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.</verse>
  <verse number="56">They returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</verse>
