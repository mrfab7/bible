<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The five curtains shall be coupled together one to another; and other five curtains shall be coupled one to another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And you shall make loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling; and likewise shall you make in the uttermost edge of another curtain, in the coupling of the second.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Fifty loops shall you make in the one curtain, and fifty loops shall you make in the edge of the curtain that is in the coupling of the second; that the loops may take hold one of another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And you shall make fifty clasps of gold, and couple the curtains together with the clasps: and it shall be one tabernacle.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And you shall make fifty clasps of brass, and put the clasps into the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the remnant that remains of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remains, shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side of that which remains in the length of the curtains of the tent, it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to cover it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And you shall make a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and a covering above of badgers’ skins.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And you shall make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards on the south side southward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And you shall make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under another board for his two tenons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And for the second side of the tabernacle on the north side there shall be twenty boards:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And two boards shall you make for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be coupled together above the head of it to one ring: thus shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And they shall be eight boards, and their sockets of silver, sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And you shall make bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the side of the tabernacle, for the two sides westward.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And the middle bar in the middle of the boards shall reach from end to end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And you shall overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings of gold for places for the bars: and you shall overlay the bars with gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And you shall raise up the tabernacle according to the fashion thereof which was showed you in the mount.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And you shall make a veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen of cunning work: with cherubim shall it be made:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And you shall hang it on four pillars of shittim wood overlaid with gold: their hooks shall be of gold, on the four sockets of silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And you shall hang up the veil under the clasps, that you may bring in thither within the veil the ark of the testimony: and the veil shall divide to you between the holy place and the most holy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And you shall put the mercy seat on the ark of the testimony in the most holy place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And you shall set the table without the veil, and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south: and you shall put the table on the north side.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And you shall make an hanging for the door of the tent, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, worked with needlework.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And you shall make for the hanging five pillars of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, and their hooks shall be of gold: and you shall cast five sockets of brass for them.</p>
