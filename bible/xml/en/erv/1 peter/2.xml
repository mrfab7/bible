<chapter book="1 Peter" number="2" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Putting away therefore all wickedness, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings,</verse>
  <verse number="2">as newborn babes, long for the spiritual milk which is without guile, that ye may grow thereby unto salvation;</verse>
  <verse number="3">if ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious:</verse>
  <verse number="4">unto whom coming, a living stone, rejected indeed of men, but with God elect, precious,</verse>
  <verse number="5">ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Because it is contained in scripture, Behold, I lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: And he that believeth on him shall not be put to shame.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For you therefore which believe is the preciousness: but for such as disbelieve, The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner;</verse>
  <verse number="8">and, A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence; for they stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But ye are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, that ye may shew forth the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light:</verse>
  <verse number="10">which in time past were no people, but now are the people of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Beloved, I beseech you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</verse>
  <verse number="12">having your behaviour seemly among the Gentiles; that, wherein they speak against you as evil-doers, they may by your good works, which they behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;</verse>
  <verse number="14">or unto governors, as sent by him for vengeance on evil-doers and for praise to them that do well.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men:</verse>
  <verse number="16">as free, and not using your freedom for a cloke of wickedness, but as bondservants of God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Servants, be in subjection to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For this is acceptable, if for conscience toward God a man endureth griefs, suffering wrongfully.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For what glory is it, if, when ye sin, and are buffeted for it, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye shall take it patiently, this is acceptable with God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that ye should follow his steps:</verse>
  <verse number="22">who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:</verse>
  <verse number="23">who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously:</verse>
  <verse number="24">who his own self bare our sins in his body upon the tree, that we, having died unto sins, might live unto righteousness; by whose stripes ye were healed.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For ye were going astray like sheep; but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.</verse>
