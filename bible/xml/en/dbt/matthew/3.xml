  <verse number="1">Now in those days comes John the baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn nigh.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For this is he who has been spoken of through Esaias the prophet, saying, Voice of him that crieth in the wilderness: prepare ye the way of [the] Lord, make straight his paths.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And John himself had his garment of camel’s hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins, and his nourishment was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the country round the Jordan,</verse>
  <verse number="6">and were baptised by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, Offspring of vipers, who has forewarned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Produce therefore fruit worthy of repentance.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And do not think to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for [our] father; for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And already the axe is applied to the root of the trees; every tree therefore not producing good fruit is cut down and cast into the fire.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I indeed baptise you with water to repentance, but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not fit to bear; he shall baptise you with [the] Holy Spirit and fire;</verse>
  <verse number="12">whose winnowing fan [is] in his hand, and he shall thoroughly purge his threshing-floor, and shall gather his wheat into the garner, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then comes Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptised of him;</verse>
  <verse number="14">but John urgently forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptised of thee; and comest thou to me?</verse>
  <verse number="15">But Jesus answering said to him, Suffer [it] now; for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffers him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Jesus, having been baptised, went up straightway from the water, and lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him:</verse>
  <verse number="17">and behold, a voice out of the heavens saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I have found my delight.</verse>
