  <verse number="1">Then Jesus was led up to the wilderness by the Spirit, to be tempted by the Devil,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he did hunger.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the Tempter having come to him said, ‘If Son thou art of God—speak that these stones may become loaves.’</verse>
  <verse number="4">But he answering said, ‘It hath been written, Not upon bread alone doth man live, but upon every word coming forth from the mouth of God.’</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then doth the Devil take him to the holy city, and doth set him on the pinnacle of the temple,</verse>
  <verse number="6">and saith to him, ‘If Son thou art of God—cast thyself down, for it hath been written, that, His messengers He shall charge concerning thee, and on hands they shall bear thee up, that thou mayest not dash on a stone thy foot.’</verse>
  <verse number="7">Jesus said to him again, ‘It hath been written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.’</verse>
  <verse number="8">Again doth the Devil take him to a very high mount, and doth shew to him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them,</verse>
  <verse number="9">and saith to him, ‘All these to thee I will give, if falling down thou mayest bow to me.’</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then saith Jesus to him, ‘Go—Adversary, for it hath been written, The Lord thy God thou shalt bow to, and Him only thou shalt serve.’</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then doth the Devil leave him, and lo, messengers came and were ministering to him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Jesus having heard that John was delivered up, did withdraw to Galilee,</verse>
  <verse number="13">and having left Nazareth, having come, he dwelt at Capernaum that is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtalim,</verse>
  <verse number="14">that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="15">‘Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations!—</verse>
  <verse number="16">the people that is sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in a region and shadow of death—light arose to them.’</verse>
  <verse number="17">From that time began Jesus to proclaim and to say, ‘Reform ye, for come nigh hath the reign of the heavens.’</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon named Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a drag into the sea—for they were fishers—</verse>
  <verse number="19">and he saith to them, ‘Come ye after me, and I will make you fishers of men,’</verse>
  <verse number="20">and they, immediately, having left the nets, did follow him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And having advanced thence, he saw other two brothers, James of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, refitting their nets, and he called them,</verse>
  <verse number="22">and they, immediately, having left the boat and their father, did follow him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Jesus was going about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the reign, and healing every disease, and every malady among the people,</verse>
  <verse number="24">and his fame went forth to all Syria, and they brought to him all having ailments, pressed with manifold sicknesses and pains, and demoniacs, and lunatics, and paralytics, and he healed them.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And there followed him many multitudes from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</verse>
