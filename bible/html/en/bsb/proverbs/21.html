<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The king’s heart is a waterway in the hand of the LORD; He directs it where He pleases.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">All a man’s ways seem right to him, but the LORD weighs the heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">To do righteousness and justice is more desirable to the LORD than sacrifice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Haughty eyes and a proud heart—the guides of the wicked—are sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The plans of the diligent bring plenty, as surely as haste leads to poverty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Making a fortune by a lying tongue is a vanishing mist, a deadly pursuit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The violence of the wicked will sweep them away because they refuse to do what is just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The way of a guilty man is crooked, but the conduct of the innocent is upright.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Better to live on a corner of the roof than to share a house with a quarrelsome wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The soul of the wicked man craves evil; his neighbor finds no favor in his eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">When a mocker is punished, the simple gain wisdom; and when a wise man is instructed, he acquires knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The Righteous One considers the house of the wicked and brings the wicked to ruin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whoever shuts his ears to the cry of the poor, he too shall cry out and receive no answer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">A gift in secret soothes anger, and a covert bribe pacifies great wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Justice executed is a joy to the righteous, but a terror to the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The man who strays from the path of understanding will rest in the assembly of the dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He who loves pleasure will become poor; the one who loves wine and oil will never be rich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The wicked become a ransom for the righteous, and the faithless for the upright.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Better to live in the desert than with a contentious and ill-tempered wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Precious treasures and oil are in the dwelling of the wise, but a foolish man consumes them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He who pursues righteousness and loving devotion finds life, righteousness, and honor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A wise man scales the city of the mighty and pulls down the stronghold in which they trust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He who guards his mouth and tongue keeps his soul from distress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Mocker is the name of the proud and arrogant man—of him who acts with excessive pride.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The craving of the slacker kills him because his hands refuse to work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">All day long he covets more, but the righteous give without restraint.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable—how much more so when brought with ill intent!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">A lying witness will perish, but the man who listens to truth will speak forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">A wicked man hardens his face, but the upright man makes his way sure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">There is no wisdom, no understanding, no counsel that can prevail against the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">A horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory is of the LORD.</p>
