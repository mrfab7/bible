  <verse number="1">But Baldad the Suhite, responding, said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">How long will you speak this way, so that the words of your mouth are like a changeable wind?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Does God supplant judgment, or does the Almighty subvert that which is just?</verse>
  <verse number="4">And if now your children have sinned against him, and he has dismissed them into the power of their iniquity,</verse>
  <verse number="5">even so, you should arise early to God, so as to beseech the Almighty.</verse>
  <verse number="6">If you approach with purity and honesty, he will quickly be attentive to you, and a peaceful life will repay your righteousness,</verse>
  <verse number="7">so much so that, if your former things were small, your latter things would be multiplied greatly.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For inquire of the earliest generation, and investigate diligently the history of the fathers,</verse>
  <verse number="9">(of course, we are but of yesterday and are ignorant that our days on earth are like a shadow,)</verse>
  <verse number="10">and they will teach you; they will speak with you and will offer you the eloquence of their hearts.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Can the marsh plant live without moisture? Or can sedges grow without water?</verse>
  <verse number="12">When it is still in flower, and has not been pulled up by hand, it withers before all other plants.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Just so are the ways of all who forget God, and the hope of the hypocrite will perish.</verse>
  <verse number="14">His frenzy will not please him, and his faith will be like a spider’s web.</verse>
  <verse number="15">He will lean on his house, and it will not stand; he will prop it up, but it will not rise.</verse>
  <verse number="16">He seems to have moisture before the sun arrives; and at sunrise, his sprout shoots forth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">His roots will crowd together over a heap of stones, and among the stones he will remain.</verse>
  <verse number="18">If someone is devoured right beside him, he will deny him and will say: “I do not know you.”</verse>
  <verse number="19">For this is the benefit of his way, that others in turn may spring up from the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="20">God will not discard the simple, nor will he extend his hand to the spiteful,</verse>
  <verse number="21">even until your mouth is filled with laughter and your lips with rejoicing.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Those who hate you, will be clothed with confusion, and the tabernacle of the impious will not continue.</verse>
