<chapter book="Job" number="31" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">I reached an agreement with my eyes, that I would not so much as think about a virgin.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For what portion should God from above hold for me, and what inheritance should the Almighty from on high keep?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Is not destruction held for the wicked and repudiation kept for those who work injustice?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Does he not examine my ways and number all my steps?</verse>
  <verse number="5">If I have walked in vanity, or if my foot has hurried towards deceitfulness,</verse>
  <verse number="6">let him weigh me in a just balance, and let God know my simplicity.</verse>
  <verse number="7">If my steps have turned aside from the way, or if my heart has followed my eyes, or if a blemish has clung to my hands,</verse>
  <verse number="8">then may I sow, and let another consume, and let my offspring be eradicated.</verse>
  <verse number="9">If my heart has been deceived over a woman, or if I have waited in ambush at my friend’s door,</verse>
  <verse number="10">then let my wife be the harlot of another, and let other men lean over her.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For this is a crime and a very great injustice.</verse>
  <verse number="12">It is a fire devouring all the way to perdition, and it roots out all that springs forth.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If I have despised being subject to judgment with my servant or my maid, when they had any complaint against me,</verse>
  <verse number="14">then what will I do when God rises to judge, and, when he inquires, how will I respond to him?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Is not he who created me in the womb, also he who labored to make him? And did not one and the same form me in the womb?</verse>
  <verse number="16">If I have denied the poor what they wanted and have made the eyes of the widow wait;</verse>
  <verse number="17">if I have eaten my morsel of food alone, while orphans have not eaten from it;</verse>
  <verse number="18">(for from my infancy mercy grew with me, and it came out with me from my mother’s womb;)</verse>
  <verse number="19">if I have looked down on him who was perishing because he had no clothing and the poor without any covering,</verse>
  <verse number="20">if his sides have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;</verse>
  <verse number="21">if I have lifted up my hand over an orphan, even when it might seem to me that I the advantage over him at the gate;</verse>
  <verse number="22">then may my shoulder fall from its joint, and may my arm, with all its bones, be broken.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For I have always feared God, like waves flowing over me, whose weight I was unable to bear.</verse>
  <verse number="24">If I have considered gold to be my strength, or if I have called purified gold ‘my Trust;’</verse>
  <verse number="25">if I have rejoiced over my great success, and over the many things my hand has obtained;</verse>
  <verse number="26">if I gazed upon the sun when it shined and the moon advancing brightly,</verse>
  <verse number="27">so that my heart rejoiced in secret and I kissed my hand with my mouth,</verse>
  <verse number="28">which is a very great iniquity and a denial against the most high God;</verse>
  <verse number="29">if I have been glad at the ruin of him who hated me and have exulted that evil found him,</verse>
  <verse number="30">for I have not been given my throat to sin by asking for a curse on his soul;</verse>
  <verse number="31">if the men around my tabernacle have not said: “He might give us some of his food, so that we will be filled,”</verse>
  <verse number="32">for the foreigner did not remain at the door, my door was open to the traveler;</verse>
  <verse number="33">if, as man does, I have hidden my sin and have concealed my iniquity in my bosom;</verse>
  <verse number="34">if I became frightened by an excessive crowd, and the disrespect of close relatives alarmed me, so that I would much rather have remained silent or have gone out the door;</verse>
  <verse number="35">then, would he grant me a hearing, so that the Almighty would listen to my desire, and he who judges would himself write a book,</verse>
  <verse number="36">which I would then carry on my shoulder and wrap around me like a crown?</verse>
  <verse number="37">With each of my steps, I would pronounce and offer it, as if to a prince.</verse>
  <verse number="38">So, if my land cries out against me, and if its furrows weep with it,</verse>
  <verse number="39">if I have used its fruits for nothing but money and have afflicted the souls of its tillers,</verse>
  <verse number="40">then, may thistles spring forth for me instead of grain, and thorns instead of barley. (This ended the words of Job.)</verse>
