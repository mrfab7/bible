  <verse number="1">After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Now the Jew’s feast of tabernacles was at hand.</verse>
  <verse number="3">His brothers therefore said to him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that your disciples also may see the works that you do.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For there is no man that does any thing in secret, and he himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For neither did his brothers believe in him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then Jesus said to them, My time is not yet come: but your time is always ready.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The world cannot hate you; but me it hates, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Go you up to this feast: I go not up yet to this feast: for my time is not yet full come.</verse>
  <verse number="9">When he had said these words to them, he stayed still in Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But when his brothers were gone up, then went he also up to the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?</verse>
  <verse number="12">And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, No; but he deceives the people.</verse>
  <verse number="13">However, no man spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the Jews marveled, saying, How knows this man letters, having never learned?</verse>
  <verse number="16">Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He that speaks of himself seeks his own glory: but he that seeks his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why go you about to kill me?</verse>
  <verse number="20">The people answered and said, You have a devil: who goes about to kill you?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and you all marvel.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Moses therefore gave to you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and you on the sabbath day circumcise a man.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are you angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?</verse>
  <verse number="26">But, see, he speaks boldly, and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</verse>
  <verse number="27">However, we know this man from where he is: but when Christ comes, no man knows from where he is.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, You both know me, and you know from where I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom you know not.</verse>
  <verse number="29">But I know him: for I am from him, and he has sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ comes, will he do more miracles than these which this man has done?</verse>
  <verse number="32">The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go to him that sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="34">You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Then said the Jews among themselves, Where will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</verse>
  <verse number="36">What manner of saying is this that he said, You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come?</verse>
  <verse number="37">In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.</verse>
  <verse number="38">He that believes on me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</verse>
  <verse number="39">(But this spoke he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)</verse>
  <verse number="40">Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?</verse>
  <verse number="42">Has not the scripture said, That Christ comes of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</verse>
  <verse number="43">So there was a division among the people because of him.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said to them, Why have you not brought him?</verse>
  <verse number="46">The officers answered, Never man spoke like this man.</verse>
  <verse number="47">Then answered them the Pharisees, Are you also deceived?</verse>
  <verse number="48">Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</verse>
  <verse number="49">But this people who knows not the law are cursed.</verse>
  <verse number="50">Nicodemus said to them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)</verse>
  <verse number="51">Does our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he does?</verse>
  <verse number="52">They answered and said to him, Are you also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee rises no prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="53">And every man went to his own house.</verse>
