<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="8" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Does not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">She stands in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">She cries at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">O you simple, understand wisdom: and, you fools, be you of an understanding heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing fraudulent or perverse in them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They are all plain to him that understands, and right to them that find knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogance, and the evil way, and the fraudulent mouth, do I hate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Riches and honor are with me; yes, durable riches and righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">My fruit is better than gold, yes, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I lead in the way of righteousness, in the middle of the paths of judgment:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass on the face of the depth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Now therefore listen to me, O you children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Blessed is the man that hears me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">For whoever finds me finds life, and shall obtain favor of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">But he that sins against me wrongs his own soul: all they that hate me love death.</p>
