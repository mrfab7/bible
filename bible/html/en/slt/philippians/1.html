<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul and Timotheus, servants of Jesus Christ, to all the holy in Christ Jesus at Philippi, with the overseers and servants:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I return thanks to my God for all your remembrance,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Always in all my prayer for you all with joy making prayer,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For your mutual participation in the good news from the first day until now;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Confident of this same, that he having begun a good work in you will complete till the day of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">As it is just for me to think this concerning you all, for my having you in the heart; both in my bonds, and in the justification and confirmation of the good news, ye all being partakers of grace with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For God is my witness, how I long for you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And this I prey, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all intelligence;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For you to try things differing; that ye may be pure and not stumbling to the day of Christ;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Filled with the fruits of justice, by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And I wish you to know, brethren, that the things concerning me have rather gone to the advancement of the good news;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">So that my bonds in Christ were manifest in the whole pretorium, and to all the rest;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And many of the brethren in the Lord, having trusted to my bonds, more abundantly dared to speak the word fearlessly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And some truly by envy and strife, and some also by kindness of disposition, proclaim Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Some truly of hired labor announce Christ, not purely, thinking to bring pressure upon my bonds:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And some of love, knowing that I am placed for justification of the good news:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For what? but in any manner, whether in pretence, or truth, Christ is announced; and in this I rejoice, and certainly I will rejoice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For I know that this shall be turned to me for salvation by your prayer, and the furnishing more of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">According to my anxious expectation, and hope, that in nothing shall I be ashamed, but in all freedom of speech, as always, and now shall Christ be Magnified in my body, whether by life, whether by death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For me to live is Christ, and to die gain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And if to live in the flesh, this to me the fruit of work: and whether I shall be taken away I know not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For I am pressed together from two, having one eager desire to be loosed, and be with Christ (rather much better:)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And to tarry yet longer in the flesh is more necessary for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And confident in this, I know that I shall remain, and shall remain near together with you all for your advancement and joy of faith:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">That your boasting may abound in Jesus Christ in me, for my coming again to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Only live as citizens worthy of the good news of Christ: that whether coming and seeing you, whether being absent, I shall bear the things concerning you, that ye stand in one spirit, one soul, fighting together in faith of the good news;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And terrified in nothing by them being hostile to you: which to them is truly an indication of destruction, and to you of salvation, and this from God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For upon you was it conferred as a favor for Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Having the same struggle which ye saw in me, and now hear in me.</p>
