<chapter book="Hebrews" number="2" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">For this reason we should give heed more abundantly to the things [we have] heard, lest in any way we should slip away.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For if the word which was spoken by angels was firm, and every transgression and disobedience received just retribution,</verse>
  <verse number="3">how shall we escape if we have been negligent of so great salvation, which, having had its commencement in being spoken [of] by the Lord, has been confirmed to us by those who have heard;</verse>
  <verse number="4">God bearing, besides, witness with [them] to [it], both by signs and wonders, and various acts of power, and distributions of [the] Holy Spirit, according to his will?</verse>
  <verse number="5">For he has not subjected to angels the habitable world which is to come, of which we speak;</verse>
  <verse number="6">but one has testified somewhere, saying, What is man, that thou rememberest him, or son of man that thou visitest him?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thou hast made him some little inferior to the angels; thou hast crowned him with glory and honour, [and hast set him over the works of thy hands;]</verse>
  <verse number="8">thou hast subjected all things under his feet. For in subjecting all things to him, he has left nothing unsubject to him. But now we see not yet all things subjected to him,</verse>
  <verse number="9">but we see Jesus, who [was] made some little inferior to angels on account of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; so that by the grace of God he should taste death for every thing.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For it became him, for whom [are] all things, and by whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to make perfect the leader of their salvation through sufferings.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For both he that sanctifies and those sanctified [are] all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</verse>
  <verse number="12">saying, I will declare thy name to my brethren; in [the] midst of [the] assembly will I sing thy praises.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And again, I will trust in him. And again, Behold, I and the children which God has given me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Since therefore the children partake of blood and flesh, he also, in like manner, took part in the same, that through death he might annul him who has the might of death, that is, the devil;</verse>
  <verse number="15">and might set free all those who through fear of death through the whole of their life were subject to bondage.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For he does not indeed take hold of angels [by the hand], but he takes hold of the seed of Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Wherefore it behoved him in all things to be made like to [his] brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people;</verse>
  <verse number="18">for, in that himself has suffered, being tempted, he is able to help those that are being tempted.</verse>
