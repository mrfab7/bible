<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A soft answer turneth away wrath; But a grievous word stirreth up anger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright; But the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The eyes of the LORD are in every place, Keeping watch upon the evil and the good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A soothing tongue is a tree of life; But perverseness therein is a wound to the spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">A fool despiseth his fatherâ€™s correction; But he that regardeth reproof is prudent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In the house of the righteous is much treasure; But in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The lips of the wise disperse knowledge; But the heart of the foolish is not stedfast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD; But the prayer of the upright is His delight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The way of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD; But He loveth him that followeth after righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">There is grievous correction for him that forsaketh the way; And he that hateth reproof shall die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The nether-world and Destruction are before the LORD; How much more then the hearts of the children of men!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">A scorner loveth not to be reproved; He will not go unto the wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance; But by sorrow of heart the spirit is broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The heart of him that hath discernment seeketh knowledge; But the mouth of fools feedeth on folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All the days of the poor are evil; But he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Better is little with the fear of the LORD, Than great treasure and turmoil therewith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, Than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">A wrathful man stirreth up discord; But he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The way of the sluggard is as though hedged by thorns; But the path of the upright is even.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A wise son maketh a glad father; But a foolish man despiseth his mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Folly is joy to him that lacketh understanding; But a man of discernment walketh straightforwards.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For want of counsel purposes are frustrated; But in the multitude of counsellors they are established.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">A man hath joy in the answer of his mouth; And a word in due season, how good is it!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The path of life goeth upward for the wise, that he may depart from the nether-world beneath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The LORD will pluck up the house of the proud; But He will establish the border of the widow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The thoughts of wickedness are an abomination to the LORD; But words of pleasantness are pure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; But he that hateth gifts shall live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The heart of the righteous studieth to answer; But the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">The LORD is far from the wicked; But He heareth the prayer of the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart; And a good report maketh the bones fat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The ear that hearkeneth to the reproof of life abideth among the wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He that refuseth correction despiseth his own soul; But he that hearkeneth to reproof getteth understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; And before honour goeth humility.</p>
