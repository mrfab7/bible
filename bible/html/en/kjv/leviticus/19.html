<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God [am] holy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep my sabbaths: I [am] the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I [am] the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it at your own will.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in the fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it [is] abominable; it shall not be accepted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Therefore [every one] that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather [every] grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and stranger: I [am] the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I [am] the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty: [but] in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Thou shalt not go up and down [as] a talebearer among thy people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour: I [am] the LORD.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself: I [am] the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and woollen come upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that [is] a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, [even] a ram for a trespass offering.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to praise the LORD [withal].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I [am] the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Ye shall not eat [any thing] with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantment, nor observe times.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you: I [am] the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore; lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of wickedness.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man, and fear thy God: I [am] the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">[But] the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I [am] the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in weight, or in measure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin, shall ye have: I [am] the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I [am] the LORD.</p>
