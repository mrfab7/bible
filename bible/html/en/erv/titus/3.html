<div class="chapter" data-book="Titus" data-chapter="3" data-translation="English Revised Version" data-translation-id="erv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Put them in mind to be in subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">to speak evil of no man, not to be contentious, to be gentle, shewing all meekness toward all men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For we also were aforetime foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, hating one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But when the kindness of God our Saviour, and his love toward man, appeared,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">not by works done in righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Ghost,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">which he poured out upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Faithful is the saying, and concerning these things I will that thou affirm confidently, to the end that they which have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">but shun foolish questionings, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A man that is heretical after a first and second admonition refuse;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">knowing that such a one is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, give diligence to come unto me to Nicopolis: for there I have determined to winter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All that are with me salute thee. Salute them that love us in faith. Grace be with you all.</p>
