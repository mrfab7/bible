<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, if thou dost accept my sayings, And my commands dost lay up with thee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">To cause thine ear to attend to wisdom, Thou inclinest thy heart to understanding,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For, if for intelligence thou callest, For understanding givest forth thy voice,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If thou dost seek her as silver, And as hid treasures searchest for her,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then understandest thou fear of Jehovah, And knowledge of God thou findest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For Jehovah giveth wisdom, From His mouth knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Even to lay up for the upright substance, A shield for those walking uprightly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">To keep the paths of judgment, And the way of His saints He preserveth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then understandest thou righteousness, And judgment, and uprightnessâ€”every good path.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For wisdom cometh into thy heart, And knowledge to thy soul is pleasant,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Thoughtfulness doth watch over thee, Understanding doth keep thee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">To deliver thee from an evil way, From any speaking froward things,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who are forsaking paths of uprightness, To walk in ways of darkness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Who are rejoicing to do evil, They delight in frowardness of the wicked,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Whose paths are crooked, Yea, they are perverted in their ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">To deliver thee from the strange woman, From the stranger who hath made smooth her sayings,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Who is forsaking the guide of her youth, And the covenant of her God hath forgotten.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For her house hath inclined unto death, And unto Rephaim her paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">None going in unto her turn back, Nor do they reach the paths of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">That thou dost go in the way of the good, And the paths of the righteous dost keep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the upright do inhabit the earth, And the perfect are left in it,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the wicked from the earth are cut off, And treacherous dealers plucked out of it!</p>
