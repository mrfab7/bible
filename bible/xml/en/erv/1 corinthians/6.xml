<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="6" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Dare any of you, having a matter against his neighbour, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Or know ye not that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world is judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more, things that pertain to this life?</verse>
  <verse number="4">If then ye have to judge things pertaining to this life, do ye set them to judge who are of no account in the church?</verse>
  <verse number="5">I say this to move you to shame. Is it so, that there cannot be found among you one wise man, who shall be able to decide between his brethren,</verse>
  <verse number="6">but brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that ye have lawsuits one with another. Why not rather take wrong? why not rather be defrauded?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Nay, but ye yourselves do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Or know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with men,</verse>
  <verse number="10">nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And such were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were sanctified, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">All things are lawful for me; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful for me; but I will not be brought under the power of any.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body:</verse>
  <verse number="14">and God both raised the Lord, and will raise up us through his power.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Know ye not that your bodies are members of Christ? shall I then take away the members of Christ, and make them members of a harlot? God forbid.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Or know ye not that he that is joined to a harlot is one body? for, The twain, saith he, shall become one flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Or know ye not that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have from God? and ye are not your own;</verse>
  <verse number="20">for ye were bought with a price: glorify God therefore in your body.</verse>
