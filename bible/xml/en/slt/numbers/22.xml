  <verse number="1">And the sons of Israel will remove and will encamp in the deserts of Moab, from the other side of Jordan at Jericho.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Balak, son of Zippor, will see all that Israel did to the Amorite.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Moab will be afraid from before the people greatly, for they were many; and Moab will feel disgust from the face of the sons of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Moab will say to the old men of Midian, Now this gathering will lick up all round about us, as the ox licking up the green of the field. And Balak, son of Zippor, the king of Moab in that time.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he will send messengers to Balaam, son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the sons of his people, to call to him, saying, Behold, a people came forth out of Egypt: behold, it covered the eye of the earth, and it dwelt from before me.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And now, come now, curse to me this people, for he is strong above me: perhaps I shall be able to strike upon him, and drive him out of the land, for I know whom thou shalt praise is praised, and whom thou shalt curse, shall be cursed.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the old men of Moab and the old men of Midian, will go, and divinations in their hand; and they will come to Balsam, and they will speak to him the words of Balak.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he will say to them, Remain here this night, and I will turn back word to you according as Jehovah will speak to me: and the leaders of Moab will dwell with Balaam.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And God will come to Balaam, and will say, What men these with thee?</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Balaam will say to God, Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent to me,</verse>
  <verse number="11">Behold, the people came forth out of Egypt, and it will cover the eye of the earth: now come curse him to me; perhaps I shall be able to fight against him and I drove him out.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And God will say to Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for he is praised.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Balaam will rise in the morning and will say to the leaders of Balak, Go to your land: for Jehovah refused to give me to go with you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the leaders will rise and go to Balak, and say, Balaam refused to come with us,</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Balak will add yet to send leaders, many and honorable, more than these.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they will go to Balaam, and say to him, Thus said Balak, son of Zippor, Now thou wilt not withhold from coming to me:</verse>
  <verse number="17">For honoring, I will honor thee greatly, and all which thou shalt say to me I will do; and come, now, curse to me this people.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Balaam will answer, and say to the servants of Balak, If Balak will give to me his house full of silver and gold, I shall not be able to pass over the mouth of Jehovah my God to do little or great.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And now, sit ye down, now also in here this night, and I shall know what Jehovah will add to speak with me.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And God will come to Balaam at night, and say to him, If the men have come to call to thee, rise up, go with them, and only the word which I shall speak to thee, thou shalt do it.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Balaam will rise up in the morning, and saddle his ass, and go with the leaders of Moab.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the anger of God will kindle because he went; and the messenger of Jehovah will stand in the way, for an adversary to him: and he rode upon his ass, and his two young men with him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And the ass will see the messenger of Jehovah standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass will turn from the way and go into the field: and Balaam will strike the ass to turn her in the way.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the messenger of Jehovah will stand in the hollow of the vineyards, an enclosure hence, and an enclosure thence.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the ass will see the messenger of Jehovah and she will press to the wall, and she will press Balaam’s foot to the wall; and he will add to strike her,</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the messenger of Jehovah will add to pass by and stand in a narrow place where is no way to turn to the right, and to the left.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And the ass will see the messenger of Jehovah and she will lie down under Balaam: and Balaam’s anger will kindle, and he will strike the ass With a rod.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Jehovah will open the mouth of the ass, and she will say to Balaam, What did I to thee that thou hast smitten me this three beats?</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Balaam will say to the ass, Because thou didst vex me: would that a sword was in my hand, for now I had killed thee.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And the ass will say to Balaam, Am not I thine ass which thou didst ride upon me ever since thou wert till this day? and being accustomed, was I accustomed to do to thee thus? And he will say, No.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And Jehovah will uncover the the eyes of Balsam, and he will see the messenger of Jehovah standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand; and he will bow down and worship upon his face.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And the messenger of Jehovah will say to him, For what didst thou strike thine ass this three beats? behold, I came forth for an adversary, for the way is perverse before me.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And the ass will see me, and will turn before me this three beats: unless she turned from before me for now also I had slain thee, and preserved her alive.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And Balaam will say to the messenger of Jehovah, I sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest to meet me in the way; and now if evil in thine eyes, I will turn back to me.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the messenger of Jehovah will say to Balaam, Go with the men: and only the word which I shall speak to thee thou shalt speak it: and Balaam will go with the leaders of Balak.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And Balak will hear that Balsam came, and he will go forth to meet him to a city of Moab, which is by the boundary of Arnon, which is in the end of the boundary.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And Balak will say to Balaam, Sending, did I not send to thee to call to thee? wherefore camest thou not to me? indeed shall I not be able to honor thee?</verse>
  <verse number="38">And Balaam will say to Balak, Behold, I come to thee: being able, shall I be able to speak any thing? the word which Jehovah shall put in my mouth I will speak it.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And Balaam will go with Balak and they will come to Kirjath Huzoth.</verse>
  <verse number="40">And Balak will sacrifice oxen and sheep, and he will send to Balaam and to the leaders which were with him.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And it will be in the morning, and Balak will take Balaam, and will bring him up to the heights of Baal, and he will see from thence the end of the people.</verse>
