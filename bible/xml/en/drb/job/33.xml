<chapter book="Job" number="33" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Hear therefore, O Job, my speeches, and hearken to all my words.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Behold now I have opened my mouth, let my tongue speak within my jaws.</verse>
  <verse number="3">My words are from my upright heart, and my lips shall speak a pure sentence.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The spirit of God made me, and the breath of the Almighty gave me life.</verse>
  <verse number="5">If thou canst, answer me, and stand up against my face.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Behold God hath made me as well as thee, and of the same clay I also was formed.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But yet let not my wonder terrify thee, and let not my eloquence be burdensome to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Now thou has said in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words :</verse>
  <verse number="9">I am clean, and without sin : I am unspotted, and there is no iniquity in me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Because he hath found complaints against me, therefore he hath counted me for his enemy.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He hath put my feet in the stocks, he hath observed all my paths.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now this is the thing in which thou art not justified : I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Dost thou strive against him, because he hath not answered thee to all words?</verse>
  <verse number="14">God speaketh once, and repeateth not the selfsame thing the second time.</verse>
  <verse number="15">By a dream in a vision by night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, and they are sleeping in their beds :</verse>
  <verse number="16">Then he openeth the ears of men, and teaching instructeth them in what they are to learn.</verse>
  <verse number="17">That he may withdraw a man from the things he is doing, and may deliver him from pride.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Rescuing his soul from corruption : and his life from passing to the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="19">He rebuketh also by sorrow in the bed, and he maketh all his bones to wither.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Bread becometh abominable to him in his life, and to his soul the meat which before he desired.</verse>
  <verse number="21">His flesh shall be consumed away, and his bones that were covered shall be made bare.</verse>
  <verse number="22">His soul hath drawn near to corruption, and his life to the destroyers.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If there shall be an angel speaking for him, one among thousands, to declare man’s uprightness,</verse>
  <verse number="24">He shall have mercy on him, and shall say : Deliver him, that he may not go down to corruption : I have found wherein I may be merciful to him.</verse>
  <verse number="25">His flesh is consumed with punishment, let him return to the days of his youth.</verse>
  <verse number="26">He shall pray to God, and he will be gracious to him : and he shall see his face with joy, and he will render to man his justice.</verse>
  <verse number="27">He shall look upon men, and shall say : I have sinned, and indeed I have offended, and I have not received what I have deserved.</verse>
  <verse number="28">He hath delivered his soul from going into destruction, that it may live and see the light.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Behold, all these things God worketh three times within every one.</verse>
  <verse number="30">That he may withdraw their souls from corruption, and enlighten them with the light of the living.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Attend, Job, and hearken to me : and hold thy peace, whilst I speak.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But if thou hast any thing to say, answer me, speak : for I would have thee to appear just.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And if thou have not, hear me : hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.</verse>
