<p class="verse" data-verse="1">For sake of Zion I will not be silent, and for sake of Jerusalem I will not rest till its justice shall go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a flame shall burn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the nations shall see thy justice, and all kings thy glory: and a new name shall be called to thee which the mouth of Jehovah shall name it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And thou wert a crown of glory in the hand of Jehovah, and a tiara of royalty in the hand of thy God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">It shall no more be said to thee, Forsaken; and to thy land it shall no more be said, Desolation; for it shall be called to thee, My delight in her, and to thy land, Married: for Jehovah delighted in thee, and thy land shall be married.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">As a young man will marry a virgin, thy sons shall marry thee: and the bridegroom rejoicing over the bride, thy God will rejoice over thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I appointed those watching over thy walls, O Jerusalem: all the day and all the night continually they shall not be silent: ye remembering Jehovah, no stillness to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And ye shall not give rest to him till he shall prepare, and till he shall set Jerusalem a praise in the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Jehovah sware by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, If I shall give more thy grain for food to thine enemies, and if the sons of the stranger shall drink thy new wine which thou didst labor for it:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For they gathering it shall eat it, and praise Jehovah; and they collecting it shall drink it in the enclosures of my holy place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Pass through, pass through in the gates; clear ye the way of the people; lift up, lift up the highway; free it from stone; raise up a signal for the peoples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Behold, Jehovah caused to be heard to the extremity of the earth, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation coming: behold, his reward with him, and his work before his face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And they called to them, The holy people, redeemed of Jehovah: and it shall be called to thee, A city sought for: not forsaken.</p>
