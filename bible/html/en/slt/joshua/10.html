<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And it will be lord Zedek, king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua took Ai and exterminated it; as he did to Jericho and to her king, so he did to Ai and her king; and that the inhabitants of Gibeon made peace with Israel, and they will be in the midst of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And they will fear greatly, for a great city was Gibeon, as one of the cities of the kingdom, and that it was great above Ai, and all her men mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And lord Zedek, king of Jerusalem, will send to Hoham, king of Hebron, and to Piram, king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia, king of Lachish, and to Debir, king of Eglon, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Come up to me and help me, and we will smite Gibeon, because she made peace with Joshua and with the sons of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the five kings of the Amorites will be gathered together and will come up: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, they and all their camps, and they will encamp against Gibeon, and they will war against her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the men of Gibeon will send to Joshua to the camp of Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hands from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites inhabiting the mountain gathered themselves together against us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And Joshua will come up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty of strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Jehovah will say to Joshua, Thou shalt not be afraid of them, for into thy hands I gave them; a man of them shall not stand before thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Joshua will come to them suddenly, all night he went up from Gilgal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Jehovah will discomfit them before Israel, and will strike them a great blow in Gibeon, and will pursue them the way of the ascent of the house of Horon, and he will strike them even to Azekah and even to Makkedah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And it will be in their fleeing from before Israel, they in the descent of the house of Horon, and Jehovah cast down upon them great stones from the heavens, even to Azekah; and more will die who died by the stones of hail than whom the sons of Israel slew with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Then will Joshua speak to Jehovah in the day Jehovah will give the Amorite before the sons of Israel, and he will say before the eyes of Israel, Sun in Gibeon, be thou silent, and thou Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the sun will be silent, and the moon stood, till the people will be avenged upon its enemies. Is it not written upon the book of the upright? and the sun will stand in the half of the heavens, and it hasted not to go down for a whole day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And there was not as that day, before it and after it, that Jehovah heard to the voice of a man: for Jehovah fought for Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Joshua turned back, and all Israel with him, to the camp of Gilgal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And these five kings will flee and will hide in a cave in Makkedah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And it will be announced to Joshua, saying, The five kings were found hid in a cave in Makkedah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Joshua will say, Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave, and set men over it to watch them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And ye shall not stand; pursue after your enemies; cut off the rear of them; ye shall not give them to come in to their cities, for Jehovah your God gave them into your hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And it will be when Joshua finished, and the sons of Israel, smiting them an exceeding great blow till he finished them, and they escaping, escaped from them and they will go to the fortified cities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And all the people will turn back to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: and none sharpened his tongue against a man to the sons of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Joshua will say, Open the mouth of the cave and bring forth to me these five kings out of the cave.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And they will do so, and will bring forth to him these five kings out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And it will be when they brought these kings forth to Joshua, and Joshua will call to every man of Israel, and will say to the leaders of the men of war having gone with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they will come near and put their feet upon their necks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Joshua will say to them, Ye shall not fear and ye shall not be dismayed; be strong and be active, for thus will Jehovah do to all your enemies whom ye war against them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And Joshua will smite them after this, and will kill them, and hang them upon five trees: and they will be hanging upon the trees till evening.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And it will be at the time of the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they will take them down from the trees and cast them into the cave where they were hid there; and they will put great stones upon the mouth of the cave till this self-same day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And Joshua took Makkedah in that day, and he will smite her with the mouth of the sword; and her king he exterminated, them, and every soul which was in her; none was left escaping: and he will do to the king of Makkedah as he did to the king of Jericho.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Joshua will pass by and all Israel with him from Makkedah to Libnah, and will fight with Libnah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And Jehovah will also give it into the hand of Israel, and her king: and he will smite it with the mouth of the sword and every soul which is in it; none was left in it escaping; and he will do to her king as he did to the king of Jericho.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And Joshua will pass over, and all Israel with him, from Libnah to Lachish, and he will encamp against it, and he will fight against it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And Jehovah will give Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he will take it in the second day, and smite it with the mouth of the sword, and every soul which is in it, according to all which he did to Libnah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Then Horam, king of Gezer, came up to help Lachish; and Joshua will smite him and his people till none was left to him escaping.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And Joshua will pass over, and all Israel with him, from Lachish to Eglon: and they will encamp against it and they will war against it:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And they will take it in that day, and they will smite it with the mouth of the sword, and every soul which is in it in that day he exterminated according to all which he did to Lachish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And Joshua will go up, and all Israel with him, from Eglon to Hebron; and they will war against it:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And they will take it and smite it with the mouth of the sword, and its king and all its cities and every soul which is in it; none was left escaping, according to all which he did to Eglon; and he will exterminate it, and every soul which is in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And Joshua will turn back, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and he will war against it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And he will take it and its king, and all its cities, and they will smite them with the mouth of the sword, and exterminate every soul which is in it; none was left escaping: as he did to Hebron so he did to Debir and to her king, and as he did to Libnah and her king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And Joshua will smite all the land of the mountain, and the south, and the valley and the ravines, and all their kings: and none was left escaping, and all breathing was exterminated, as Jehovah the God of Israel commanded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And Joshua will smite from Kadesh-Barnea and even to Gaza, and all the land of Goshen and even to Gibeon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And all these kings and their land Joshua took, one time; for Jehovah the God of Israel fought for Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And Joshua will turn back and all Israel with him to the camp of Gilgal.</p>
