<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="2" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, if you accept my words and hide my commandments within you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">if you incline your ear to wisdom and direct your heart to understanding,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">if you truly call out to insight and lift your voice to understanding,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">if you seek it like silver and search it out like hidden treasure,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">then you will discern the fear of the LORD and discover the knowledge of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For the LORD gives wisdom; from His mouth come knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He stores up sound wisdom for the upright; He is a shield to those who walk with integrity,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">to guard the paths of justice and protect the way of His saints.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then you will discern righteousness and justice and equityâ€”every good path.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will delight your soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Discretion will watch over you, and understanding will guard you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">to deliver you from the way of evil, from the man who speaks perversity,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">from those who leave the straight paths to walk in the ways of darkness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">from those who enjoy doing evil and rejoice in the twistedness of evil,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">whose paths are crooked and whose ways are devious.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">It will rescue you from the forbidden woman, from the stranger with seductive words</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">who abandons the partner of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For her house sinks down to death, and her tracks to the departed spirits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">None who go to her return or negotiate the paths of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">So you will follow in the ways of the good, and keep to the paths of the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the upright will inhabit the land, and the blameless will remain in it;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be uprooted.</p>
