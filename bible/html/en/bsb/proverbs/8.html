<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Does not wisdom call out, and understanding raise her voice?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">On the heights overlooking the road, at the crossroads she takes her stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Beside the gates to the city, at the entrances she cries out:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">“To you, O men, I call out, and my cry is to the sons of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">O simple ones, learn to be shrewd; O fools, gain understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Listen, for I speak of noble things, and the opening of my lips will reveal right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For my mouth will speak the truth, and wickedness is detestable to my lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">All the words of my mouth are righteous; none are crooked or perverse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They are all plain to the discerning, and upright to those who find knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Receive my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than pure gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For wisdom is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire compares with her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I, wisdom, dwell together with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">To fear the LORD is to hate evil; I hate arrogant pride, evil conduct, and perverse speech.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Counsel and sound judgment are mine; I have insight and strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">By me kings reign, and rulers enact just laws;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">By me princes rule, and all nobles who govern justly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I love those who love me, and those who seek me early shall find me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">With me are riches and honor, enduring wealth and righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">My fruit is better than gold, pure gold, and my harvest surpasses choice silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I walk in the way of righteousness, along the paths of justice,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">bestowing wealth on those who love me and making their treasuries full.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The LORD created me as His first course, before His works of old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">From everlasting I was established, from the beginning, before the earth began.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">When there were no watery depths, I was brought forth, when no springs were overflowing with water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Before the mountains were settled, before the hills, I was brought forth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">before He made the land or fields, or any of the dust of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">I was there when He established the heavens, when He inscribed a circle on the face of the deep,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">when He established the clouds above, when the fountains of the deep gushed forth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">when He set a boundary for the sea, so that the waters would not surpass His command, when He marked out the foundations of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Then I was a skilled craftsman at His side, and His delight day by day, rejoicing always in His presence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">I was rejoicing in His whole world, delighting together in the sons of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Now therefore, my sons, listen to me, for blessed are those who keep my ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Listen to instruction and be wise; do not ignore it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Blessed is the man who listens to me, watching daily at my doors, waiting at the posts of my doorway.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">For whoever finds me finds life and obtains the favor of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">But he who fails to find me harms himself; all who hate me love death.”</p>
