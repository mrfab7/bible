<p class="verse" data-verse="1">In the seventh month, in the twenty-first day of the month, the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Speak now to Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">‘Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How do you see it now? Isn’t it in your eyes as nothing?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Yet now be strong, Zerubbabel,’ says Yahweh. ‘Be strong, Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people of the land,’ says Yahweh, ‘and work, for I am with you,’ says Yahweh of Armies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">This is the word that I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt, and my Spirit lived among you. ‘Don’t be afraid.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For this is what Yahweh of Armies says: ‘Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, the earth, the sea, and the dry land;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and I will shake all nations. The precious things of all nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory, says Yahweh of Armies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The silver is mine, and the gold is mine,’ says Yahweh of Armies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">‘The latter glory of this house will be greater than the former,’ says Yahweh of Armies; ‘and in this place will I give peace,’ says Yahweh of Armies.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the Word of Yahweh came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">“Thus says Yahweh of Armies: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">‘If someone carries holy meat in the fold of his garment, and with his fold touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any food, will it become holy?’” The priests answered, “No.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Then Haggai said, “If one who is unclean by reason of a dead body touch any of these, will it be unclean?” The priests answered, “It will be unclean.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then Haggai answered, “‘So is this people, and so is this nation before me,’ says Yahweh; ‘and so is every work of their hands. That which they offer there is unclean.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Now, please consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid on a stone in the temple of Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Through all that time, when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were only ten. When one came to the wine vat to draw out fifty, there were only twenty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I struck you with blight, mildew, and hail in all the work of your hands; yet you didn’t turn to me,’ says Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">‘Consider, please, from this day and backward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, since the day that the foundation of Yahweh’s temple was laid, consider it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Is the seed yet in the barn? Yes, the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree haven’t brought forth. From this day will I bless you.’”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The Word of Yahweh came the second time to Haggai in the twenty-fourth day of the month, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">“Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, ‘I will shake the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms. I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. I will overthrow the chariots, and those who ride in them. The horses and their riders will come down, everyone by the sword of his brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">In that day, says Yahweh of Armies, will I take you, Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel,’ says Yahweh, ‘and will make you as a signet, for I have chosen you,’ says Yahweh of Armies.”</p>
