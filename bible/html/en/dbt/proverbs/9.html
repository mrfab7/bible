<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wisdom hath built her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">she hath slaughtered her cattle, she hath mingled her wine, she hath also prepared her table;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">she hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the summits of the high places of the city,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither. To him that is void of understanding, she saith,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Come, eat ye of my bread, and drink of the wine that I have mingled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Forsake follies and live, and go in the way of intelligence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He that instructeth a scorner getteth to himself shame; and he that reproveth a wicked [man] [getteth] to himself a blot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee; reprove a wise [man], and he will love thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Impart to a wise [man], and he will become yet wiser; teach a righteous [man], and he will increase learning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; and the knowledge of the Holy is intelligence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and years of life shall be added to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If thou art wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself; and if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The foolish woman is clamorous; she is stupid, and knoweth nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And she sitteth at the entry of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">to call passers-by who go right on their ways:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither. And to him that is void of understanding she saith,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Stolen waters are sweet, and the bread of secrecy is pleasant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But he knoweth not that the dead are there; [that] her guests are in the depths of Sheol.</p>
