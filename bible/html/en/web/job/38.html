<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="38" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Yahweh answered Job out of the whirlwind,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Who is this who darkens counsel by words without knowledge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Brace yourself like a man, for I will question you, then you answer me!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">“Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if you have understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Who determined its measures, if you know? Or who stretched the line on it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Whereupon were its foundations fastened? Or who laid its cornerstone,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">“Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth from the womb,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">when I made clouds its garment, and wrapped it in thick darkness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">marked out for it my bound, set bars and doors,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and said, ‘Here you may come, but no further. Here your proud waves shall be stayed?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">“Have you commanded the morning in your days, and caused the dawn to know its place;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">that it might take hold of the ends of the earth, and shake the wicked out of it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">It is changed as clay under the seal, and stands forth as a garment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">From the wicked, their light is withheld. The high arm is broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">“Have you entered into the springs of the sea? Or have you walked in the recesses of the deep?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Or have you seen the gates of the shadow of death?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Have you comprehended the earth in its breadth? Declare, if you know it all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">“What is the way to the dwelling of light? As for darkness, where is its place,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">that you should take it to its bound, that you should discern the paths to its house?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Surely you know, for you were born then, and the number of your days is great!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Have you entered the treasuries of the snow, or have you seen the treasures of the hail,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">By what way is the lightning distributed, or the east wind scattered on the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Who has cut a channel for the flood water, or the path for the thunderstorm;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">To cause it to rain on a land where no man is; on the wilderness, in which there is no man;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">to satisfy the waste and desolate ground, to cause the tender grass to spring forth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Does the rain have a father? Or who fathers the drops of dew?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Out of whose womb came the ice? The gray frost of the sky, who has given birth to it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The waters become hard like stone, when the surface of the deep is frozen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">“Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades, or loosen the cords of Orion?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Can you lead forth the constellations in their season? Or can you guide the Bear with her cubs?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you establish its dominion over the earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">“Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, That abundance of waters may cover you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go? Do they report to you, ‘Here we are?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Who has put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who has given understanding to the mind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can pour out the bottles of the sky,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">when the dust runs into a mass, and the clods of earth stick together?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">“Can you hunt the prey for the lioness, or satisfy the appetite of the young lions,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">when they crouch in their dens, and lie in wait in the thicket?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Who provides for the raven his prey, when his young ones cry to God, and wander for lack of food?</p>
