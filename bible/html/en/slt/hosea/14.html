<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Turn back, O Israel, even to Jehovah thy God, for thou wert weak in thine iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Take with you words and turn back to Jehovah: say to him, Thou wilt take away all iniquity, and take good: and we will requite the fruits of our lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Assur will not save us; we will not ride upon a horse, and we will no more say, Our God, to the work of our hands, for in thee the orphan shall be compassionated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I will heal their turning away, I loved them largely: for mine anger turned away from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I will be as the dew to Israel: he shall blossom as the lily and strike his roots as Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">His sprouts shall go, and his strength shall be as the olive tree, and the odor to him as Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They sitting in his shadow shall turn back; they shall live upon the grain, and they shall blossom as the vine: his remembrance as the wine of Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Ephraim: What to me yet to images? I humbled, and I will regard him: I as the green cypress From me thy fruit was found.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who being wise, and he shall understand these things? and knowing, and he shall know them? for the ways of Jehovah are straight, and the just shall go in them: and they transgressing shall be weak in them.</p>
