  <verse number="1">Wisdom hath builded her house; She hath hewn out her seven pillars:</verse>
  <verse number="2">She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; She hath also furnished her table:</verse>
  <verse number="3">She hath sent forth her maidens; She crieth upon the highest places of the city:</verse>
  <verse number="4">Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: As for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Come, eat ye of my bread, And drink of the wine which I have mingled.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Leave off, ye simple ones, and live; And walk in the way of understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He that correcteth a scoffer getteth to himself reviling; And he that reproveth a wicked man getteth himself a blot.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Reprove not a scoffer, lest he hate thee: Reprove a wise man, and he will love thee.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: Teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For by me thy days shall be multiplied, And the years of thy life shall be increased.</verse>
  <verse number="12">If thou art wise, thou art wise for thyself; And if thou scoffest, thou alone shalt bear it.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The foolish woman is clamorous; She is simple, and knoweth nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And she sitteth at the door of her house, On a seat in the high places of the city,</verse>
  <verse number="15">To call to them that pass by, Who go right on their ways:</verse>
  <verse number="16">Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither; And as for him that is void of understanding, she saith to him,</verse>
  <verse number="17">Stolen waters are sweet, And bread eaten in secret is pleasant.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But he knoweth not that the dead are there; That her guests are in the depths of Sheol.</verse>
