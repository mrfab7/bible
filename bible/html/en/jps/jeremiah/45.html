<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning thee, O Baruch: Thou didst say:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Woe is me now! For the LORD hath added sorrow to my pain; I am weary with my groaning, And I find no rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thus shalt thou say unto him: Thus saith the LORD: Behold, that which I have built will I break down, And that which I have planted I will pluck up; And this in the whole land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And seekest thou great things for thyself? Seek them not; for, behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith the LORD; but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goest.â€™</p>
