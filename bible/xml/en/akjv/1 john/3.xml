<chapter book="1 John" number="3" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knows us not, because it knew him not.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And every man that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Whoever commits sin transgresses also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And you know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Whoever stays in him sins not: whoever sins has not seen him, neither known him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Little children, let no man deceive you: he that does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He that commits sin is of the devil; for the devil sins from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Whoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And why slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Marvel not, my brothers, if the world hate you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brothers. He that loves not his brother stays in death.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Whoever hates his brother is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But whoever has this world’s good, and sees his brother have need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwells the love of God in him?</verse>
  <verse number="18">My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And whatever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And he that keeps his commandments dwells in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he stays in us, by the Spirit which he has given us.</verse>
