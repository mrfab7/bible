<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="1" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and our brother Sosthenes,</verse>
  <verse number="2">To the church of God in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus and called to be holy, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I always thank my God for you because of the grace He has given you in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For in Him you have been enriched in every way, in all speech and all knowledge,</verse>
  <verse number="6">because our testimony about Christ was confirmed in you.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly await the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He will sustain you to the end, so that you will be blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="9">God, who has called you into fellowship with His Son Jesus Christ our Lord, is faithful.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I appeal to you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree together, so that there may be no divisions among you and that you may be united in mind and conviction.</verse>
  <verse number="11">My brothers, some from Chloe’s household have informed me that there are quarrels among you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">What I mean is this: Individuals among you are saying, “I follow Paul,” “I follow Apollos,” “I follow Cephas,” or “I follow Christ.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized into the name of Paul?</verse>
  <verse number="14">I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,</verse>
  <verse number="15">so no one can say that you were baptized into my name.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that I do not remember if I baptized anyone else.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with words of wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For it is written: “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise; the intelligence of the intelligent I will frustrate.”</verse>
  <verse number="20">Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</verse>
  <verse number="21">For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know Him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Jews demand signs and Greeks search for wisdom,</verse>
  <verse number="23">but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,</verse>
  <verse number="24">but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For the foolishness of God is wiser than man’s wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than man’s strength.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Brothers, consider the time of your calling: Not many of you were wise by human standards; not many were powerful; not many were of noble birth.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise; God chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong.</verse>
  <verse number="28">He chose the lowly and despised things of the world, and the things that are not, to nullify the things that are,</verse>
  <verse number="29">so that no one may boast in His presence.</verse>
  <verse number="30">It is because of Him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God: our righteousness, holiness, and redemption.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Therefore, as it is written: “Let him who boasts boast in the Lord.”</verse>
