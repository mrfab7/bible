  <verse number="1">If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions,</verse>
  <verse number="2">make full my joy, that ye be of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;</verse>
  <verse number="3">doing nothing through faction or through vainglory, but in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself;</verse>
  <verse number="4">not looking each of you to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</verse>
  <verse number="6">who, existing in the form of God, counted not the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped,</verse>
  <verse number="7">but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men;</verse>
  <verse number="8">and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient even unto death, yea, the death of the cross.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and gave unto him the name which is above every name;</verse>
  <verse number="10">that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth,</verse>
  <verse number="11">and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="12">So then, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;</verse>
  <verse number="13">for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Do all things without murmurings and questionings:</verse>
  <verse number="15">that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye are seen as lights in the world,</verse>
  <verse number="16">holding forth the word of life; that I may have whereof to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain neither labor in vain.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all:</verse>
  <verse number="18">and in the same manner do ye also joy, and rejoice with me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your state.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child serveth a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the gospel.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me:</verse>
  <verse number="24">but I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come shortly.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need;</verse>
  <verse number="26">since he longed after you all, and was sore troubled, because ye had heard that he was sick:</verse>
  <verse number="27">for indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
  <verse number="28">I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honor:</verse>
  <verse number="30">because for the work of Christ he came nigh unto death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.</verse>
