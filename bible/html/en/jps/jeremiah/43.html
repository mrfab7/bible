<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the LORD their God, wherewith the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">then spoke Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah: ‘Thou speakest falsely; the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say: Ye shall not go into Egypt to sojourn there;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">but Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captives to Babylon.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, hearkened not to the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from all the nations whither they had been driven to sojourn in the land of Judah:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">the men, and the women, and the children, and the king’s daughters, and every person that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and they came into the land of Egypt; for they hearkened not to the voice of the LORD; and they came even to Tahpanhes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Take great stones in thy hand, and hide them in the mortar in the framework, which is at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and say unto them: Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, My servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And he shall come, and shall smite the land of Egypt; such as are for death to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity, and such as are for the sword to the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives; and he shall fold up the land of Egypt, as a shepherd foldeth up his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He shall also break the pillars of Beth-shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall he burn with fire.’</p>
