<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="41" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wilt thou draw out the crocodile with a hook and with a cord wilt thou press down his tongue?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Wilt thou put a rope in his nose? and wilt thou hollow out his jaw with a thorn?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Will he multiply supplications to thee? will he speak soft things to thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Will he cut out a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant forever?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Wilt thou play with him as a bird? and wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Shall companions give a feast upon him? shall they divide him between the Canaanites?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wilt thou fill his skin with pointed weapons? and his head with fish spears?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Put thy hand upon him; remember the battle, thou shalt not add.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Behold, his hope was false: shall he not be cast down at his sight?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">None fierce that he will rouse him up: and who is he will stand before me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Who anticipated me, and I will recompense? under all the heavens it is to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I will not be silent for him, and the word of powers and the beauty of his preparation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who uncovered the face of his clothing? who shall come with his double bridle?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Who opened the doors of his face? his teeth a terror round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Pride of strong shields shut up with a seal of straitness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">One shall touch upon another, and the wind shall not come between them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">They will adhere each in his brotherhood, they will hold together, and they will not be separated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">His sneezings a light will shine, and his eyes as the eyelashes of the dawning of day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">From his mouth flaming torches shall go forth; sparks of fire will escape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">From his nostrils smoke will come forth as a blown pot, and a caldron.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His soul will kindle coals, and a flame will go forth from his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">In his neck will lodge strength, and terror will leap before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The flaps of his flesh adhered: it will press upon him; it will not be moved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">His heart will press as a stone; and it will press as the under millstone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">His lifting up, the mighty will be stirred up: from breaking they shall purify themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The sword reaching him, shall not be raised up: the spear, the dart, and the coat of mail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He will reckon iron for straw, and brass for wood of rottenness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The son of the bow shall not cause him to flee: sling-stones were turned to him for stubble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">The bludgeon was reckoned to him for stubble: and he will laugh at the shaking of the javelin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Sharpnesses of the potsherd under him: he will spread a trench upon the mire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">He will cause the deep to boil as a pot: he will set the sea as ointment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He will cause a beaten path to shine after him: the deep will be reckoned to be hoary.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">None upon the dust being like him; he made him without fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">He will see every thing high: he is king over all the sons of pride.</p>
