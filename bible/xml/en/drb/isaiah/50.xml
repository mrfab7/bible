  <verse number="1">THUS saith the Lord: What is this bill of the divorce of your mother, with which I have put her away? or who is my creditor, to whom I sold you: behold you are sold for your iniquities, and for your wicked deeds have I put your mother away.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Because I came, and there was not a man: I called, and there was none that would hear. Is my hand shortened and become little, that I cannot redeem? or is there no strength in me to deliver? Behold at my rebuke I will make the sea a desert, I will turn the rivers into dry land: the fishes shall rot for want of water, and shall die for thirst.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I will clothe the heavens with darkness, and will make sackcloth their covering.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The Lord hath given me a learned tongue, that I should know how to uphold by word him that is weary: he wakeneth in the morning, in the morning he wakeneth my ear, that I may hear him as a master.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The Lord God hath opened my ear, and I do not resist: I have not gone back.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I have given my body to the strikers, and my cheeks to them that plucked them: I have not turned away my face from them that rebuked me, and spit upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The Lord God is my helper, therefore am I not confounded: therefore have I set my face as a most hard rock, and I know that I shall not be confounded.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He is near that justifieth me, who will contend with me? let us stand together, who is my adversary? let him come near to me.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Behold the Lord God is my helper: who is he that shall condemn me? Lo, they shall all be destroyed as a garment, the moth shall eat them up.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Who is there among you that feareth the Lord, that heareth the voice of his servant, that hath walked in darkness, and hath no light? let him hope in the name of the Lord, and lean upon his God.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Behold all you that kindle a fire, encompassed with dames, walk in the light of your fire, and in the dames which you have kindled: this is done to you by my hand, you shall sleep in sorrows.</verse>
