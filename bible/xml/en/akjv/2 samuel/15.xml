  <verse number="1">And it came to pass after this, that Absalom prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, Of what city are you? And he said, Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Absalom said to him, See, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear you.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Absalom said moreover, Oh that I were made judge in the land, that every man which has any suit or cause might come to me, and I would do him justice!</verse>
  <verse number="5">And it was so, that when any man came near to him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kissed him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment: so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And it came to pass after forty years, that Absalom said to the king, I pray you, let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For your servant vowed a vow while I stayed at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the LORD shall bring me again indeed to Jerusalem, then I will serve the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the king said to him, Go in peace. So he arose, and went to Hebron.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, Absalom reigns in Hebron.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And with Absalom went two hundred men out of Jerusalem, that were called; and they went in their simplicity, and they knew not any thing.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong; for the people increased continually with Absalom.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And there came a messenger to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And David said to all his servants that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee; for we shall not else escape from Absalom: make speed to depart, lest he overtake us suddenly, and bring evil on us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the king’s servants said to the king, Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king shall appoint.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, which were concubines, to keep the house.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the king went forth, and all the people after him, and tarried in a place that was far off.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Then said the king to Ittai the Gittite, Why go you also with us? return to your place, and abide with the king: for you are a stranger, and also an exile.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Whereas you came but yesterday, should I this day make you go up and down with us? seeing I go where I may, return you, and take back your brothers: mercy and truth be with you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And Ittai answered the king, and said, As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, surely in what place my lord the king shall be, whether in death or life, even there also will your servant be.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And David said to Ittai, Go and pass over. And Ittai the Gittite passed over, and all his men, and all the little ones that were with him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And all the country wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed over: the king also himself passed over the brook Kidron, and all the people passed over, toward the way of the wilderness.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And see Zadok also, and all the Levites were with him, bearing the ark of the covenant of God: and they set down the ark of God; and Abiathar went up, until all the people had done passing out of the city.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the king said to Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city: if I shall find favor in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me again, and show me both it, and his habitation:</verse>
  <verse number="26">But if he thus say, I have no delight in you; behold, here am I, let him do to me as seems good to him.</verse>
  <verse number="27">The king said also to Zadok the priest, Are not you a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.</verse>
  <verse number="28">See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness, until there come word from you to certify me.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem: and they tarried there.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And David went up by the ascent of mount Olivet, and wept as he went up, and had his head covered, and he went barefoot: and all the people that was with him covered every man his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And one told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, O LORD, I pray you, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And it came to pass, that when David was come to the top of the mount, where he worshipped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent, and earth on his head:</verse>
  <verse number="33">To whom David said, If you pass on with me, then you shall be a burden to me:</verse>
  <verse number="34">But if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father’s servant till now, so will I now also be your servant: then may you for me defeat the counsel of Ahithophel.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And have you not there with you Zadok and Abiathar the priests? therefore it shall be, that what thing soever you shall hear out of the king’s house, you shall tell it to Zadok and Abiathar the priests.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz Zadok’s son, and Jonathan Abiathar’s son; and by them you shall send to me every thing that you can hear.</verse>
  <verse number="37">So Hushai David’s friend came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.</verse>
