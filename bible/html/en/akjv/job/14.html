<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">He comes forth like a flower, and is cut down: he flees also as a shadow, and continues not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And does you open your eyes on such an one, and bring me into judgment with you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with you, you have appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But man dies, and wastes away: yes, man gives up the ghost, and where is he?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decays and dries up:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">So man lies down, and rises not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">O that you would hide me in the grave, that you would keep me secret, until your wrath be past, that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">You shall call, and I will answer you: you will have a desire to the work of your hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For now you number my steps: do you not watch over my sin?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and you sew up my iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And surely the mountains falling comes to nothing, and the rock is removed out of his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The waters wear the stones: you wash away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and you destroy the hope of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">You prevail for ever against him, and he passes: you change his countenance, and send him away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His sons come to honor, and he knows it not; and they are brought low, but he perceives it not of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But his flesh on him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.</p>
