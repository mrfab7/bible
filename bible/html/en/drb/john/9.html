<p class="verse" data-verse="1">AND Jesus passing by, saw a man, who was blind from his birth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And his disciples asked him: Rabbi, who hath sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Jesus answered: Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I must work the works of him that sent me, whilst it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When he had said these things, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and spread the clay on his eyes,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And said to him: Go, wash in the pool of Siloe, which is interpreted, Sent. He went therefore, and washed, and he came seeing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The neighbours therefore, and they who had seen him before that he was a beggar, said: Is not this he that sat and begged? Some said: This is he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But others said: No, but he is like him. But he said: I am he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They said therefore to him: How were thy eyes opened?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He answered: That man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me: Go to the pool of Siloe, and wash. And I went, I washed, and I see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And they said to him: Where is he? He saith: I know not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They bring him that had been blind to the Pharisees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Now it was the sabbath, when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Again therefore the Pharisees asked him, how he had received his sight. But he said to them: He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and I see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Some therefore of the Pharisees said: This man is not of God, who keepeth not the sabbath. But others said: How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">They say therefore to the blind man again: What sayest thou of him that hath opened they eyes? And he said: He is a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The Jews then did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And asked them, saying: Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then doth he now see?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">His parents answered them, and said: We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But how he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: ask himself: he is of age, let him speak for himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">These things his parents said, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had already agreed among themselves, that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Therefore did his parents say: He is of age, ask himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">They therefore called the man again that had been blind, and said to him: Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He said therefore to them: If he be a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">They said then to him: What did he to thee? How did he open thy eyes?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He answered them: I have told you already, and you have heard: why would you hear it again? will you also become his disciples?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">They reviled him therefore, and said: Be thou his disciple; but we are the disciples of Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">We know that God spoke to Moses: but as to this man, we know not from whence he is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The man answered, and said to them: Why, herein is a wonderful thing, that you know not from whence he is, and he hath opened my eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Now we know that God doth not hear sinners: but if a man be a server of God, and doth his will, him he heareth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard, that any man hath opened the eyes of one born blind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Unless this man were of God, he could not do any thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">They answered, and said to him: Thou wast wholly born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Jesus heard that they had cast him out: and when he had found him, he said to him: Dost thou believe in the Son of God?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">He answered, and said: Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And Jesus said to him: Thou hast both seen him; and it is he that talketh with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And he said: I believe, Lord. And falling down, he adored him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And Jesus said: For judgment I am come into this world; that they who see not, may see; and they who see, may become blind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And some of the Pharisees, who were with him, heard: and they said unto him: Are we also blind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Jesus said to them: If you were blind, you should not have sin: but now you say: We see. Your sin remaineth.</p>
