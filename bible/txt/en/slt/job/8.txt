1	And Bildad the Shuhite will answer and say,
2	How long wilt thou speak these things? and the great spirit of the words of thy mouth?
3	Will God pervert judgment? and if the Almighty will pervert justice?
4	If thy sons sinned to him, and he will send them away by the hand of their transgression;
5	If thou shalt seek to God, if thou shalt make supplication to him;
6	If thou wert pure and upright, for now he will awake for thee and requite the habitation of thy justice.
7	And thy beginning was small, and thy latter state shall increase greatly.
8	For ask now to the first generation, and prepare to seek their fathers:
9	(For yesterday are we and we shall not know, for our days upon earth are a shadow:)
10	Shall they not teach thee, and say to thee, and bring forth words from their heart?
11	Shall the bulrush lift itself up without a marsh? shall the marsh grass grow without water?
12	While yet in its greenness it shall not break off, and it will dry up before grass.
13	So the paths of all forgetting God and the hope of the profane one shall perish.
14	Which his hope shall be cut off, and the spiderâ€™s house his trust.
15	He shall lean upon his house and it shall not stand: he shall hold fast upon it, and it shall not rise up.
16	It was moist before the sun, and its sprout will come forth upon his garden.
17	His roots were entwined upon a heap, he shall see a house of stones.
18	If he should swallow him down from his place, and it lied upon it: I saw thee not.
19	Behold, this the rejoicing of his way, and from the dust shall they cause another to grow.
20	Behold, God will not reject the blameless one, and he will not take hold upon the hand of those doing evil:
21	Till he shall fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with shouts of joy.
22	They hating thee shall put on shame; and the tent of the unjust shall not be.
