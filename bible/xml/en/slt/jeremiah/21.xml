<chapter book="Jeremiah" number="21" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The word which was to Jeremiah from Jehovah in king Zedekiah’s sending to him Pashur son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah son Maaseiah the priest, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Seek now: Jehovah for us; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel is warring against us; perhaps Jehovah will do with us his wonders, and he shall go up from us.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Jeremiah will say to them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thus said Jehovah God of Israel: Behold me turning about the weapons of war which are in your hands which ye are fighting with them with the king of Babel, and the Chaldeans, pressing upon you without the wall, and I gathered you to the midst of this city.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And I warred with you with a hand stretched out and with an arm of strength, and in anger and in heat and in great wrath.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And I struck the inhabitants of this city, and man and beast: in great death they shall die.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And after this, says Jehovah, I will give Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and those being left in this city, from death, from the sword, and from famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them seeking their soul: and he smote them with the mouth of the sword; he shall not have compassion upon them, and he shall not spare, and he shall not pity.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And to this people thou shalt say, Thus said Jehovah, Behold me giving before your face the way of life and the way of death.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He dwelling in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by death: and he going forth and falling to the Chaldeans pressing upon you, shall live, and his soul was to him for booty.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For I set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, says Jehovah: into the hand of the king of Babel shall it be given, and it was burnt with fire.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And for the house of the king of Judah, hear ye the word of Jehovah:</verse>
  <verse number="12">O house of David, thus said Jehovah, Judge judgment for the morning, and deliver him taken by force from the hand of him oppressing, lest my wrath shall go forth as fire, and burn, and none quenching from the face of the evil of your doings.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Behold me against thee, thou inhabitress of the valley, rock of the plain, says Jehovah; those saying, Who shall come down against us? and who shall come into our habitations?</verse>
  <verse number="14">And I reviewed over you according to the fruit of your doings, says Jehovah: and I kindled a fire in her forest, and it consumed all round about her.</verse>
