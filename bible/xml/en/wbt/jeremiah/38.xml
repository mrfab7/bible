  <verse number="1">Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken to all the people, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which shall take it.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Therefore the princes said to the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then they took Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now when Ebed-melech the Cushite, one of the eunuchs who was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;</verse>
  <verse number="8">Ebed-melech went out of the king’s house, and spoke to the king, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="9">My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die by hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Cushite, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dieth.</verse>
  <verse number="11">So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old decayed rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Ebed-melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and decayed rags under thy arm-holes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.</verse>
  <verse number="13">So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken to me?</verse>
  <verse number="16">So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, As the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thy house:</verse>
  <verse number="18">But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape from their hand.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that have fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak to thee: so it shall be well to thee, and thy soul shall live.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But if thou shalt refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shown me:</verse>
  <verse number="22">And behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah’s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.</verse>
  <verse number="23">So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Then said Zedekiah to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come to thee, and say to thee, Declare to us now what thou hast said to the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said to thee:</verse>
  <verse number="26">Then thou shalt say to them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Then came all the princes to Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.</verse>
  <verse number="28">So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.</verse>
