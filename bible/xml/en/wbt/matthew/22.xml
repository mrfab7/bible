  <verse number="1">And Jesus answered, and spoke to them again by parables, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">The kingdom of heaven is like to a certain king, who made a marriage for his son,</verse>
  <verse number="3">And sent his servants to call them that were invited to the wedding: and they would not come.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Again, he sent other servants, saying, Tell them who are invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But they made light of it, and went, one to his farm, another to his merchandise.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the remnant took his servants, and treated them spitefully, and slew them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But when the king heard of it, he was wroth: and he sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then he saith to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they who were invited were not worthy.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, invite to the marriage.</verse>
  <verse number="10">So those servants went out into the highways, and collected all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who had not a wedding-garment:</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he saith to him, Friend, how camest thou in hither, not having a wedding-garment? And he was speechless.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into utter darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For many are called, but few are chosen.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they sent out to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not?</verse>
  <verse number="18">But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Show me the tribute-money. And they brought to him a penny.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he saith to them, Whose is this image, and superscription?</verse>
  <verse number="21">They say to him, Cesar’s. Then saith he to them, Render therefore to Cesar, the things which are Cesar’s; and to God, the things that are God’s.</verse>
  <verse number="22">When they had heard these words, they marveled, and left him, and departed.</verse>
  <verse number="23">The same day came to him the Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,</verse>
  <verse number="24">Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man shall die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Now there were with us seven brothers: and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased; and having no issue, left his wife to his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Likewise the second also, and the third, to the seventh.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And last of all the woman died also.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Jesus answered and said to them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="31">But as concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="32">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.</verse>
  <verse number="34">But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were assembled about him.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Then one of them who was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,</verse>
  <verse number="36">Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</verse>
  <verse number="37">Jesus said to him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</verse>
  <verse number="38">This is the first and great commandment.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And the second is like it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</verse>
  <verse number="40">On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="41">While the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them,</verse>
  <verse number="42">Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say to him, The son of David.</verse>
  <verse number="43">He saith to them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="44">The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thy enemies thy footstool?</verse>
  <verse number="45">If David then calleth him Lord, how is he his son?</verse>
  <verse number="46">And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man, from that day forth, ask him any more questions.</verse>
