  <verse number="1">Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For to us was the gospel preached, as well as to them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Seeing therefore it remains that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</verse>
  <verse number="7">Again, he limits a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if you will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</verse>
  <verse number="9">There remains therefore a rest to the people of God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God did from his.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Let us labor therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</verse>
