<p class="verse" data-verse="1">This is what the LORD says: “Where is your mother’s certificate of divorce with which I sent her away? Or to which of My creditors did I sell you? Look, you were sold for your iniquities, and for your transgressions your mother was sent away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Why was no one there when I arrived? Why did no one answer when I called? Is My hand too short to redeem you? Or do I lack the strength to deliver you? Behold, My rebuke dries up the sea; I turn the rivers into a desert; the fish rot for lack of water and die of thirst.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I clothe the heavens in black and make sackcloth their covering.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The Lord GOD has given Me the tongue of discipleship, to sustain the weary with a word. He awakens Me morning by morning; He awakens My ear to listen as a disciple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The Lord GOD has opened My ears, and I have not been rebellious, nor have I turned back.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I offered My back to those who struck Me, and My cheeks to those who tore out My beard. I did not hide My face from scorn and spittle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Because the Lord GOD helps Me, I have not been disgraced; therefore I have set My face like flint, and I know that I will not be put to shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The One who vindicates Me is near. Who will dare to contend with Me? Let us confront each other! Who has a case against Me? Let him approach Me!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Surely the Lord GOD helps Me. Who is there to condemn Me? See, they will all wear out like a garment; the moths will devour them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who among you fears the LORD and obeys the voice of His Servant? Who among you walks in darkness and has no light? Let him trust in the name of the LORD; let him lean on his God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Behold, all you who kindle a fire, who array yourselves with firebrands, walk in the light of your fire and of the firebrands you have lit! This is what you will receive from My hand: You will lie down in a place of torment.</p>
