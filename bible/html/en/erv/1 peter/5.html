<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The elders therefore among you I exhort, who am a fellow-elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Tend the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not of constraint, but willingly, according unto God; nor yet for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">neither as lording it over the charge allotted to you, but making yourselves ensamples to the flock.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And when the chief Shepherd shall be manifested, ye shall receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Likewise, ye younger, be subject unto the elder. Yea, all of you gird yourselves with humility, to serve one another: for God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">casting all your anxiety upon him, because he careth for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Be sober, be watchful: your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">whom withstand stedfast in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are accomplished in your brethren who are in the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the God of all grace, who called you unto his eternal glory in Christ, after that ye have suffered a little while, shall himself perfect, stablish, strengthen you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">To him be the dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">By Silvanus, our faithful brother, as I account him, I have written unto you briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God: stand ye fast therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">She that is in Babylon, elect together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Mark my son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be unto you all that are in Christ.</p>
