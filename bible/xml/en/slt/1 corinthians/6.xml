<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="6" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Dare any of you, having an affair with another, be judged by the unjust, and not by the holy ones?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Know ye not that the holy ones shall judge the world? and if the world be judged by you, are ye unworthy of the least judgments?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Know ye not that we shall judge messengers? also not only things pertaining to the cares of life?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Therefore truly, if ye have judgments pertaining to the cares of life, set them counted as nothing in the church.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For confusion I speak to you. So is there not one wise with you, who will be able to judge between his brother?</verse>
  <verse number="6">But brother with brother is judged, and this by the unbelieving.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore truly, already is there wholly a misfortune in you, that ye have judgments with yourselves. Wherefore had ye not rather be treated ill? wherefore had ye not rather be defrauded?</verse>
  <verse number="8">But ye treat ill, and defraud, and that the brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Or know ye not that the unjust shall not inherit the kingdom of God Be ye not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor sodomites,</verse>
  <verse number="10">Nor thieves; nor covetous, nor intoxicated, nor railers, nor rapacious, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And these were some of you: but ye were washed, but ye were consecrated, but ye were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.</verse>
  <verse number="12">All things are lawful to me, but all are not profitable: all are lawful to me, but I will not be exercised by power under any.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Foods for the belly, and the belly for foods: and God will also leave unemployed this and them. And the body not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And God also raised up the Lord, and us will he also raise up by his power.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? having taken the members of Christ, shall I make members of a harlot? It may not be.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Or know ye not that he joined to a harlot is one body? for they shall be, he says, they two into one flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he joined to the Lord is one spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Flee fornication. Every sin which if a man do is without the body; but he committing fornication sins against his own body.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Or know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit in you, which ye have from God, and ye are not your own?</verse>
  <verse number="20">For ye were bought for a price: then glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are of God.</verse>
