<chapter book="Daniel" number="7" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">In one year to Belshazzar the king of Babel, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: at that time he wrote the dream, telling the head of the words.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Daniel answered and said, I was seeing in my vision by night, and lo, the four winds of the heavens rushing forth to the great sea.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And four great beasts went up from the sea, different this from this.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The first as a lion, and the wings of an eagle to it; I was seeing even till its wings were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and upon its feet it was caused to stand as a man, and a man’s heart was given to it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And lo, another beast, a second being like to a bear; and it rose up to one side, and three ribs in its mouth between its teeth: and saying to it thus, Arise, eat much flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="6">After this I was seeing, and lo, another, as a panther, and to it four wings of a bird upon its back, and four heads to the beast; and dominion was given to it.</verse>
  <verse number="7">After this I was seeing in the visions of the night, and lo, a fourth beast, fearful, and strong and powerful exceedingly; and great teeth of iron to it, eating and beating small, and treading down the remainder with its feet: and it being different from all the beasts that were before it; and ten horns to it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I was considering upon the horns, and lo, another little horn went up among them, and three from the first horns were plucked up from before it: and lo, eyes as the eyes of a man in this horn, and a mouth speaking great things.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I was seeing even till thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days sat, his garment white as snow, and the hair of his head as pure wool: his throne a flame of fire, his wheels a burning fire.</verse>
  <verse number="10">A river of fire flowed and went out from before him: thousands of thousands will wait upon him, and myriads of myriads will stand before him: the tribunal sat, and the books were opened.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I was seeing at that time from the voice of the great words that the horn was speaking: I was seeing even till that the beast was killed and its body destroyed, and it was given to the burning fire.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the rest of the beasts they took away their power: and length in life was given to them for a season and time.</verse>
  <verse number="13">I was seeing in the visions of the night, and lo, with the clouds of the heavens as the Son of man he came, and turning even to the Ancient of days; and they brought him near before him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And to him was given dominion, power and honor, and a kingdom; and all peoples and nations and tongues shall serve to him: his power an eternal power that shall not pass away, and his kingdom which shall not be destroyed.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I Daniel was grieved in the midst of the sheath, and the visions of my heart will terrify me.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I drew near to one of those standing by, and I sought from him the truth concerning all this: and he said to me, and he will cause me to know the interpretation of the words.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Those great beasts that they are four, four kings they shall rise up from the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the holy ones of the Most High shall take the kingdom and shall possess the kingdom even to forever, and even to forever of forever.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Then I willed to speak the truth concerning the fourth beast that was different from all of them, exceedingly fearful, its teeth of iron and its hoofs of brass; eating, beating small, and treading down the remainder with its feet;</verse>
  <verse number="20">And concerning the ten horns that were upon its head, and the other that went up, and three fell from before it; and this horn and eyes to it, and a mouth speaking great things, and its sight great above its companions.</verse>
  <verse number="21">I was seeing, and this horn made an encounter with the holy ones, and prevailed against them;</verse>
  <verse number="22">Even till that the Ancient of days came, and the judgment was given to the holy ones of the Most High; and the time extending and the holy ones possessed the kingdom.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom in the earth, that shall be different from all kingdoms, and shall eat up all the earth, and shall tread it down and beat it.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the ten horns from this kingdom, ten kings shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be different from the first, and he shall humble three kings.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he shall speak words against the Most High, and he shall vex the holy ones of the Most High, and he will hope to change times and law: and they shall be given into his hand even to a time and times, and the dividing of time.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the tribunal sat, and they shall take away his power to cut off and to destroy even to the end.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And the kingdom and the power, and the greatness of the kingdom under All the heavens was given to the people of the holy ones of the Most High his kingdom an eternal kingdom, and all powers shall serve to him, and shall hear.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Even to this the end of the word. I Daniel, my thoughts will greatly terrify me, and my brightness will be changed upon me: and I kept the word in my heart.</verse>
