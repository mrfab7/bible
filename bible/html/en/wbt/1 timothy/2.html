<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I exhort therefore, that first of all supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Who will have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For which I am ordained a preacher and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in decent apparel, with modesty and sobriety; not with broidered hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Notwithstanding, she will be saved in child-bearing, if they continue in faith, and charity, and holiness, with sobriety.</p>
