<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But I returned and considered all the oppressions that are done under the sun; and behold the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power, but they had no comforter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Wherefore I praised the dead that are already dead more than the living that are yet alive;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">but better than they both is he that hath not yet been, who hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Again, I considered all labour and all excelling in work, that it is a man’s rivalry with his neighbour. This also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The fool foldeth his hands together, And eateth his own flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Better is a handful of quietness, Than both the hands full of labour and striving after wind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Then I returned and saw vanity under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">There is one that is alone, and he hath not a second; yea, he hath neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labour, neither is his eye satisfied with riches: ‘for whom then do I labour, and bereave my soul of pleasure?’ This also is vanity, yea, it is a grievous business.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for their labour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath not another to lift him up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Again, if two lie together, then they have warmth; but how can one be warm alone?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And if a man prevail against him that is alone, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Better is a poor and wise child than an old and foolish king, who knoweth not how to receive admonition any more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For out of prison he came forth to be king; although in his kingdom he was born poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I saw all the living that walk under the sun, that they were with the child, the second, that was to stand up in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">There was no end of all the people, even of all them whom he did lead; yet they that come after shall not rejoice in him. Surely this also is vanity and a striving after wind.</p>
