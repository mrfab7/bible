  <verse number="1">How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince’s daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a skillful workman.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thy eyes like the fish-pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh towards Damascus.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thy head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thy head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.</verse>
  <verse number="6">How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!</verse>
  <verse number="7">This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of its boughs: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I am my beloved’s, and his desire is towards me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourisheth, whether the tender grape appeareth, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.</verse>
