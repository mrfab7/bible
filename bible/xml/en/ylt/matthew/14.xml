  <verse number="1">At that time did Herod the tetrarch hear the fame of Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and said to his servants, ‘This is John the Baptist, he did rise from the dead, and because of this the mighty energies are working in him.’</verse>
  <verse number="3">For Herod having laid hold on John, did bind him, and did put him in prison, because of Herodias his brother Philip’s wife,</verse>
  <verse number="4">for John was saying to him, ‘It is not lawful to thee to have her,’</verse>
  <verse number="5">and, willing to kill him, he feared the multitude, because as a prophet they were holding him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But the birthday of Herod being kept, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst, and did please Herod,</verse>
  <verse number="7">whereupon with an oath he professed to give her whatever she might ask.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And she having been instigated by her mother—‘Give me (says she) here upon a plate the head of John the Baptist;</verse>
  <verse number="9">and the king was grieved, but because of the oaths and of those reclining with him, he commanded it to be given;</verse>
  <verse number="10">and having sent, he beheaded John in the prison,</verse>
  <verse number="11">and his head was brought upon a plate, and was given to the damsel, and she brought it nigh to her mother.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And his disciples having come, took up the body, and buried it, and having come, they told Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="13">and Jesus having heard, withdrew thence in a boat to a desolate place by himself, and the multitudes having heard did follow him on land from the cities.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And Jesus having come forth, saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion upon them, and did heal their infirm;</verse>
  <verse number="15">and evening having come, his disciples came to him, saying, ‘The place is desolate, and the hour hath now past, let away the multitudes that, having gone to the villages, they may buy to themselves food.’</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Jesus said to them, ‘They have no need to go away—give ye them to eat.’</verse>
  <verse number="17">And they say to him, ‘We have not here except five loaves, and two fishes.’</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he said, ‘Bring ye them to me hither.’</verse>
  <verse number="19">And having commanded the multitudes to recline upon the grass, and having taken the five loaves and the two fishes, having looked up to the heaven, he did bless, and having broken, he gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the multitudes,</verse>
  <verse number="20">and they did all eat, and were filled, and they took up what was over of the broken pieces twelve hand-baskets full;</verse>
  <verse number="21">and those eating were about five thousand men, apart from women and children.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And immediately Jesus constrained his disciples to go into the boat, and to go before him to the other side, till he might let away the multitudes;</verse>
  <verse number="23">and having let away the multitudes, he went up to the mountain by himself to pray, and evening having come, he was there alone,</verse>
  <verse number="24">and the boat was now in the midst of the sea, distressed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went away to them, walking upon the sea,</verse>
  <verse number="26">and the disciples having seen him walking upon the sea, were troubled saying—‘It is an apparition,’ and from the fear they cried out;</verse>
  <verse number="27">and immediately Jesus spake to them, saying, ‘Be of good courage, I am he, be not afraid.’</verse>
  <verse number="28">And Peter answering him said, ‘Sir, if it is thou, bid me come to thee upon the waters;’</verse>
  <verse number="29">and he said, ‘Come;’ and having gone down from the boat, Peter walked upon the waters to come unto Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="30">but seeing the wind vehement, he was afraid, and having begun to sink, he cried out, saying, ‘Sir, save me.’</verse>
  <verse number="31">And immediately Jesus, having stretched forth the hand, laid hold of him, and saith to him, ‘Little faith! for what didst thou waver?’</verse>
  <verse number="32">and they having gone to the boat the wind lulled,</verse>
  <verse number="33">and those in the boat having come, did bow to him, saying, ‘Truly—God’s Son art thou.’</verse>
  <verse number="34">And having passed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret,</verse>
  <verse number="35">and having recognized him, the men of that place sent forth to all that region round about, and they brought to him all who were ill,</verse>
  <verse number="36">and were calling on him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment, and as many as did touch were saved.</verse>
