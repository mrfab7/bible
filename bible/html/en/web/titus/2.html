<div class="chapter" data-book="Titus" data-chapter="2" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But say the things which fit sound doctrine,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">that older men should be temperate, sensible, sober minded, sound in faith, in love, and in patience:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and that older women likewise be reverent in behavior, not slanderers nor enslaved to much wine, teachers of that which is good;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">to be sober minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that God’s word may not be blasphemed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Likewise, exhort the younger men to be sober minded;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">in all things showing yourself an example of good works; in your teaching showing integrity, seriousness, incorruptibility,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">and soundness of speech that can’t be condemned; that he who opposes you may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say about us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Exhort servants to be in subjection to their own masters, and to be well-pleasing in all things; not contradicting;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">not stealing, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God, our Savior, in all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">instructing us to the intent that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we would live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good works.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Say these things and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no man despise you.</p>
