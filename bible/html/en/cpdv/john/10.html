<div class="chapter" data-book="John" data-chapter="10" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“Amen, amen, I say to you, he who does not enter through the door into the fold of the sheep, but climbs up by another way, he is a thief and a robber.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">But he who enters through the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name, and he leads them out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And when he has sent out his sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But they do not follow a stranger; instead they flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Jesus spoke this proverb to them. But they did not understand what he was saying to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Therefore, Jesus spoke to them again: “Amen, amen, I say to you, that I am the door of the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">All others, as many as have come, are thieves and robbers, and the sheep did not listen to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I am the door. If anyone has entered through me, he will be saved. And he shall go in and go out, and he shall find pastures.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The thief does not come, except so that he may steal and slaughter and destroy. I have come so that they may have life, and have it more abundantly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I am the good Shepherd. The good Shepherd gives his life for his sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But the hired hand, and whoever is not a shepherd, to whom the sheep do not belong, he sees the wolf approaching, and he departs from the sheep and flees. And the wolf ravages and scatters the sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the hired hand flees, because he is a hired hand and there is no concern for the sheep within him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I am the good Shepherd, and I know my own, and my own know me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">just as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. And I lay down my life for my sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And I have other sheep that are not of this fold, and I must lead them. They shall hear my voice, and there shall be one sheepfold and one shepherd.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For this reason, the Father loves me: because I lay down my life, so that I may take it up again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">No one takes it away from me. Instead, I lay it down of my own accord. And I have the power to lay it down. And I have the power to take it up again. This is the commandment that I have received from my Father.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A dissension occurred again among the Jews because of these words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Then many of them were saying: “He has a demon or he is insane. Why do you listen him?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Others were saying: “These are not the words of someone who has a demon. How would a demon be able to open the eyes of the blind?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Now it was the Feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem, and it was winter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Jesus was walking in the temple, in the portico of Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And so the Jews surrounded him and said to him: “How long will you hold our souls in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Jesus answered them: “I speak to you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in the name of my Father, these offer testimony about me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">My sheep hear my voice. And I know them, and they follow me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And I give them eternal life, and they shall not perish, for eternity. And no one shall seize them from my hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">What my Father gave to me is greater than all, and no one is able to seize from the hand of my Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">I and the Father are one.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Therefore, the Jews took up stones, in order to stone him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Jesus answered them: “I have shown you many good works from my Father. For which of those works do you stone me?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The Jews answered him: “We do not stone you for a good work, but for blasphemy and because, though you are a man, you make yourself God.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Jesus responded to them: “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said: you are gods?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">If he called those to whom the word of God was given gods, and Scripture cannot be broken,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">why do you say, about him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You have blasphemed,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">If I do not do the works of my Father, do not believe in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">But if I do them, even if you are not willing to believe in me, believe the works, so that you may know and believe that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Therefore, they sought to apprehend him, but he escaped from their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And he went again across the Jordan, to that place where John first was baptizing. And he lodged there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And many went out to him. And they were saying: “Indeed, John accomplished no signs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">But all things whatsoever that John said about this man were true.” And many believed in him.</p>
