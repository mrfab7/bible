<chapter book="Job" number="29" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And Job continued his discourse:</verse>
  <verse number="2">“How I long for the months gone by, for the days when God watched over me,</verse>
  <verse number="3">when His lamp shone above my head, and by His light I walked through the darkness,</verse>
  <verse number="4">when I was in my prime, when the friendship of God rested on my tent,</verse>
  <verse number="5">when the Almighty was still with me and my children were around me,</verse>
  <verse number="6">when my steps were bathed in cream and the rock poured out for me streams of oil!</verse>
  <verse number="7">When I went out to the city gate and took my seat in the public square,</verse>
  <verse number="8">the young men saw me and withdrew, and the old men rose to their feet.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The princes refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The voices of the nobles were hushed, and their tongues stuck to the roofs of their mouths.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For those who heard me called me blessed, and those who saw me commended me,</verse>
  <verse number="12">because I rescued the poor who cried out and the fatherless who had no helper.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The dying man blessed me, and I made the widow’s heart sing for joy.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; justice was my robe and my turban.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I served as eyes to the blind and as feet to the lame.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I was a father to the needy, and I took up the case of the stranger.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I shattered the fangs of the unjust and snatched the prey from his teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="18">So I thought: ‘I will die in my nest and multiply my days as the sand.</verse>
  <verse number="19">My roots will spread out to the waters, and the dew will rest nightly on my branches.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My glory is ever new within me, and my bow is renewed in my hand.’</verse>
  <verse number="21">Men listened to me with expectation, waiting silently for my counsel.</verse>
  <verse number="22">After my words, they spoke no more; my speech settled on them like dew.</verse>
  <verse number="23">They waited for me as for rain and drank in my words like spring showers.</verse>
  <verse number="24">If I smiled at them, they did not believe it; the light of my countenance was precious.</verse>
  <verse number="25">I chose their course and presided as chief. So I dwelt as a king among his troops, as a comforter of the mourners.</verse>
