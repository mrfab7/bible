<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Dying flies spoil the sweetness of the ointment. Wisdom and glory is more precious than a small and shortlived folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The heart of a wise man is in his right hand, and the heart of a fool is in his left hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Yea, and the fool when he walketh in the way, whereas be himself is a fool, esteemeth all men fools.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If the spirit of him that hath power, ascend upon thee, leave not thy place: because care will make the greatest sins to cease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as it were by an error proceeding from the face of the prince:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">A fool set in high dignity, and the rich sitting beneath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I have seen servants upon horses: and princes walking on the ground as servants.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that breaketh a hedge, a serpent shall bite him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He that removeth stones, shall be hurt by them: and he that cutteth trees, shall be wounded by them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If the iron be blunt, and be not as before, but be made blunt, with much labour it shall be sharpened: and after industry shall follow wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If a serpent bite in silence, he is nothing better that backbiteth secretly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The words of the mouth of a wise man are grace: but the lips of a fool shall throw him down headlong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The beginning of his words is folly, and the end of his talk is a mischievous error.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">A fool multiplieth words. A man cannot tell what hath been before him: and what shall be after him, who can tell him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The labour of fools shall afflict them that know not how to go to the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and when the princes eat in the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Blessed is the land, whose king is noble, and whose princes eat in due season for refreshment, and not for riotousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">By slothfulness a building shall be brought down, and through the weakness of hands, the house shall drop through.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For laughter they make bread, and wine that the living may feast: and all things obey money.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Detract not the king, no not in thy thought; and speak not evil of the rich man in thy private chamber: because even the birds of the air will carry thy voice, and he that hath wings will tell what thou hast said.</p>
