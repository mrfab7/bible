<div class="chapter" data-book="Jeremiah" data-chapter="12" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Thou indeed, O Lord, art just, if I plead with thee, but yet I will speak what is just to thee: Why doth the way of the wicked prosper: why is it well with all them that transgress, and do wickedly?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thou hast planted them, and they have taken root: they prosper and bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And thou, O Lord, hast known me, thou hast seen me, and proved my heart with thee: gather them together as sheep for a sacrifice, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">How long shall the land mourn, and the herb of every field wither for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? The beasts and the birds are consumed: because they have said: He shall not see our last end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If thou hast wearied with running with footmen, how canst thou contend with horses? and if thou hast been secure in a land of peace, what wilt thou do in the swelling of the Jordan?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have fought against thee, and have cried after thee with full voice: believe them not when they speak good things to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I have forsaken my house, I have left my inheritance: I have given my dear soul into the land of her enemies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">My inheritance is become to me as a lion in the wood: is hath cried out against me, therefore have I hated it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Is my inheritance to me as a speckled bird? Is it as a bird died throughout? come ye, assemble yourselves, all the beasts of the earth, make haste to devour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot: they have changed my delightful portion into a desolate wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They have laid it waste, and it hath mourned for me. With desolation is all the land made desolate; because there is none that considereth in the heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The spoilers are come upon all the ways of the wilderness, for the sword of the Lord shall devour from one end of the land to the other end thereof: there is no peace for all flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They have sown wheat, and reaped thorns: they have received an inheritance, and it shall not profit them: you shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce wrath of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thus saith the Lord against all my wicked neighbors, that touch the inheritance that I have shared out to my people Israel: Behold I will pluck them out of their land, and I will pluck the house of Juda out of the midst of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And when I shall have plucked them out, I will return, and have mercy on them: and I will bring them back, every man to his inheritance, and every man to his land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And it shall come to pass, if they will be taught, and will learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name: The Lord liveth, as they have taught my people to swear by baal: that they shall be built up in the midst of my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But if they will not hear, I will utterly pluck out and destroy that nation, saith the Lord.</p>
