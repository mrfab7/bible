<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and ye shall keep my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And when ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD, ye shall offer it that ye may be accepted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow: and if aught remain until the third day, it shall be burnt with fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination; it shall not be accepted:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">but every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity, because he hath profaned the holy thing of the LORD: and that soul shall be cut off from his people.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid, betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom given her; they shall be punished; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye use enchantments, nor practise augury.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the LORD.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And ye shall observe all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.</p>
