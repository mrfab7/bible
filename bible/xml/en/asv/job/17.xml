  <verse number="1">My spirit is consumed, my days are extinct, The grave is ready for me.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Surely there are mockers with me, And mine eye dwelleth upon their provocation.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Give now a pledge, be surety for me with thyself; Who is there that will strike hands with me?</verse>
  <verse number="4">For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: Therefore shalt thou not exalt them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He that denounceth his friends for a prey, Even the eyes of his children shall fail.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But he hath made me a byword of the people; And they spit in my face.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, And all my members are as a shadow.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Upright men shall be astonished at this, And the innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Yet shall the righteous hold on his way, And he that hath clean hands shall wax stronger and stronger.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But as for you all, come on now again; And I shall not find a wise man among you.</verse>
  <verse number="11">My days are past, my purposes are broken off, Even the thoughts of my heart.</verse>
  <verse number="12">They change the night into day: The light, say they, is near unto the darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If I look for Sheol as my house; If I have spread my couch in the darkness;</verse>
  <verse number="14">If I have said to corruption, Thou art my father; To the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister;</verse>
  <verse number="15">Where then is my hope? And as for my hope, who shall see it?</verse>
  <verse number="16">It shall go down to the bars of Sheol, When once there is rest in the dust.</verse>
