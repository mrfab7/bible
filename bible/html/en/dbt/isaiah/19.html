<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The burden of Egypt. Behold, Jehovah rideth upon a swift cloud, and cometh to Egypt; and the idols of Egypt are moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt melteth in the midst of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And I will incite the Egyptians against the Egyptians; and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbour; city against city, kingdom against kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst of it, and I will destroy the counsel thereof; and they shall seek unto the idols and unto the conjurers, and unto the necromancers, and unto the soothsayers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord, and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and the rivers shall stink, and the streams of Egypt shall be diminished and drain away: the reeds and sedges shall wither.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The meadows by the Nile, on the banks of the Nile, and everything sown by the Nile, shall be dried up, be driven away, and be no [more].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the fishers shall mourn, and all they that cast fish-hook into the Nile shall lament, and they that spread net upon the waters shall languish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And they that work in fine flax, and they that weave white stuffs shall be ashamed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And her pillars shall be broken in pieces, and all workers for hire shall be sad of soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They are but fools, the princes of Zoan, the wise counsellors of Pharaoh: [their] counsel is become senseless. How say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Where are they then, thy wise [men]? Let them now tell thee, and let them make known what Jehovah of hosts hath purposed upon Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The princes of Zoan are become foolish, the princes of Noph are deceived; and the corner-stones of its tribes have caused Egypt to err.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Jehovah hath mingled a spirit of perverseness in the midst thereof; and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunkard staggereth in his vomit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or tail, palm-branch or rush, may do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">In that day shall Egypt be like unto women; and it shall tremble and fear because of the shaking of the hand of Jehovah of hosts, which he shaketh over it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the land of Judah shall be a dismay unto Egypt: every one that thinketh of it shall be afraid for himself, because of the counsel of Jehovah of hosts, which he hath purposed against it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">In that day shall there be five cities in the land of Egypt speaking the language of Canaan, and swearing by Jehovah of hosts: one shall be called, The city of Heres.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">In that day shall there be an altar to Jehovah in the midst of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to Jehovah:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">and it shall be for a sign and for a witness to Jehovah of hosts in the land of Egypt; for they shall cry unto Jehovah because of the oppressors, and he will send them a saviour and defender, who shall deliver them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Jehovah shall be known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians shall know Jehovah in that day, and shall serve with sacrifice and oblation; and they shall vow a vow unto Jehovah, and perform it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Jehovah will smite Egypt; he will smite and heal: and they shall return to Jehovah, and he will be entreated of them, and will heal them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria; and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria; and Egypt shall serve with Assyria.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, a blessing in the midst of the earth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">whom Jehovah of hosts will bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine inheritance!</p>
