<chapter book="Job" number="17" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Are there not mockers with me? and does not my eye continue in their provocation?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Lay down now, put me in a surety with you; who is he that will strike hands with me?</verse>
  <verse number="4">For you have hid their heart from understanding: therefore shall you not exalt them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He that speaks flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.</verse>
  <verse number="6">He has made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.</verse>
  <verse number="7">My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Upright men shall be astonished at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that has clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But as for you all, do you return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.</verse>
  <verse number="11">My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.</verse>
  <verse number="12">They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If I wait, the grave is my house: I have made my bed in the darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I have said to corruption, You are my father: to the worm, You are my mother, and my sister.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?</verse>
  <verse number="16">They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.</verse>
