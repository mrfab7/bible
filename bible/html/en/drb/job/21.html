<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="21" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Job answered, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear, I beseech you, my words, and do penance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Suffer me, and I will speak, and after, if you please, laugh at my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Is my debate against man, that I should not have just reason to be troubled?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Hearken to me and be astonished, and lay your finger on your mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">As for me, when I remember, I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Why then do the wicked live, are they advanced, and strengthened with riches?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Their seed continueth before them, a multitude of kinsmen, and of childrenâ€™s children in their sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Their houses are secure and peaceable, and the rod of God is not upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Their cattle have conceived, and failed not: their cow has calved, and is not deprived of her fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Their little ones go out like a flock, and their children dance and play.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They take the timbrel, and the harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment they go down to hell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Who have said to God: Depart from us, we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what doth it profit us if we pray to him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Yet because their good things are not in their hand, may the counsel of the wicked be far from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">How often shall the lamp of the wicked be put out, and a deluge come upon them, and he shall distribute the sorrows of his wrath?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">They shall be as chaff before the face of the wind, and as ashes which the whirlwind scattereth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">God shall lay up the sorrow of the father for his children: and when he shall repay, then shall he know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">His eyes shall see his own destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For what is it to him what befalleth his house after him: and if the number of his months be diminished by one half?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Shall any one teach God knowledge, who judgeth those that are high?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">One man dieth strong, and hale, rich and happy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">His bowels are full of fat, and his bones are moistened with marrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But another dieth in bitterness of soul without any riches:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And yet they shall sleep together in the dust, and worms shall cover them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Surely I know your thoughts, and your unjust judgments against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For you say: Where is the house of the prince ? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Ask any one of them that go by the way, and you shall perceive that he knoweth these same things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Because the wicked man is reserved to the day of destruction, and he shall be brought to the day of wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Who shall reprove his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">He shall be brought to the graves, and shall watch in the heap of the dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">He hath been acceptable to the gravel of Cocytus, and he shall draw every man after him, and there are innumerable before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">How then do ye comfort me in vain, whereas your answer is shewn to be repugnant to truth ?</p>
