<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Righteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet would I reason the cause with thee: wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? wherefore are all they at ease that deal very treacherously?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thou hast planted them, yea, they have taken root; they grow, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But thou, O LORD, knowest me; thou seest me, and triest mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of the whole country wither? for the wickedness of them that dwell therein, the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He shall not see our latter end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and though in a land of peace thou art secure, yet how wilt thou do in the pride of Jordan?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; even they have cried aloud after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I have forsaken mine house, I have cast off mine heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Mine heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest: she hath uttered her voice against me; therefore I have hated her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Is mine heritage unto me as a speckled bird of prey? are the birds of prey against her round about? go ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, bring them to devour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They have made it a desolation; it mourneth unto me, being desolate; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Spoilers are come upon all the bare heights in the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD devoureth from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh hath peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They have sown wheat, and have reaped thorns; they have put themselves to pain, and profit nothing: and ye shall be ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce anger of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thus saith the LORD against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit: Behold, I will pluck them up from off their land, and will pluck up the house of Judah from among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them up, I will return and have compassion on them; and I will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">and it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, As the LORD liveth; even as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built up in the midst of my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But if they will not hear, then will I pluck up that nation, plucking up and destroying it, saith the LORD.</p>
