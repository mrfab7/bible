<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But Job answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">As for me, [is] my complaint to man? and if [it were so], why should not my spirit be troubled?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Mark me, and be astonished, and lay [your] hand upon [your] mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Their houses [are] safe from fear, neither [is] the rod of God upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">What [is] the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Lo, their good [is] not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and [how oft] cometh their destruction upon them! [God] distributeth sorrows in his anger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know [it].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For what pleasure [hath] he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Shall [any] teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices [which] ye wrongfully imagine against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For ye say, Where [is] the house of the prince? and where [are] the dwelling places of the wicked?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him [what] he hath done?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as [there are] innumerable before him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?</p>
