<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, by reason of the multitude of men and cattle therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Ho, ho, flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Ho Zion, escape, thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For thus saith the LORD of hosts: After glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For, behold, I will shake mine hand over them, and they shall be a spoil to those that served them: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And many nations shall join themselves to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the LORD shall inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Be silent, all flesh, before the LORD: for he is waked up out of his holy habitation.</p>
