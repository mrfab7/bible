  <verse number="1">Chorus to Bride: Where has your beloved gone, O most beautiful among women? To where has your beloved turned aside, so that we may seek him with you?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Bride: My beloved has descended to his garden, to the courtyard of aromatic plants, in order to pasture in the gardens and gather the lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I am for my beloved, and my beloved is for me. He pastures among the lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Groom to Bride: My love, you are beautiful: sweet and graceful, like Jerusalem; terrible, like an army in battle array.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Avert your eyes from me, for they have caused me fly away. Your hair is like a flock of goats, which have appeared out of Gilead.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Your teeth are like a flock of sheep, which have ascended from the washing, each one with its identical twin, and not one among them is barren.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Like the skin of a pomegranate, so are your cheeks, except for your hiddenness.</verse>
  <verse number="8">There are sixty queens, and eighty concubines, and maidens without number.</verse>
  <verse number="9">One is my dove, my perfect one. One is her mother; elect is she who bore her. The daughters saw her, and they proclaimed her most blessed. The queens and concubines saw her, and they praised her.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Chorus to Groom: Who is she, who advances like the rising dawn, as beautiful as the moon, as elect as the sun, as terrible as an army in battle array?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Bride: I descended to the garden of nuts, in order to see the fruits of the steep valleys, and to examine whether the vineyard had flourished and the pomegranates had produced buds.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I did not understand. My soul was stirred up within me because of the chariots of Amminadab.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Chorus to Bride: Return, return, O Sulamitess. Return, return, so that we may consider you.</verse>
