  <verse number="3">Blessed by the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with spiritual blessings in heavenly places, in Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="4">As he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and unspotted in his sight in charity.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Who hath predestinated us unto the adoption of children through Jesus Christ unto himself: according to the purpose of his will:</verse>
  <verse number="6">Unto the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he hath graced us in his beloved son.</verse>
  <verse number="7">In whom we have redemption through his blood, the remission of sins, according to the riches of his grace,</verse>
  <verse number="8">Which hath superabounded in us in all wisdom and prudence,</verse>
  <verse number="9">That he might make known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in him,</verse>
  <verse number="10">In the dispensation of the fulness of times, to re-establish all things in Christ, that are in heaven and on earth, in him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">In whom we also are called by lot, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things according to the counsel of his will.</verse>
  <verse number="12">That we may be unto the praise of his glory, we who before hoped Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="13">In whom you also, after you had heard the word of truth, (the gospel of your salvation;) in whom also believing, you were signed with the holy Spirit of promise,</verse>
  <verse number="14">Who is the pledge of our inheritance, unto the redemption of acquisition, unto the praise of his glory.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Wherefore I also, hearing of your faith that is in the Lord Jesus, and of your love towards all the saints,</verse>
  <verse number="16">Cease not to give thanks for you, making commemoration of you in my prayers,</verse>
  <verse number="17">That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and of revelation, in the knowledge of him:</verse>
  <verse number="18">The eyes of your heart enlightened, that you may know what the hope is of the glory of his inheritance in the saints.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And what is the exceeding greatness of his power towards us, who believe according to the operation of the might of his power,</verse>
  <verse number="20">Which he wrought in Christ, raising him up from the dead, and setting him on his right hand in the heavenly places.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Above all principality, and power, and virtue, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he hath subjected all things under his feet, and hath made him head over all the church,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Which is his body, and the fulness of him who is filled all in all.</verse>
