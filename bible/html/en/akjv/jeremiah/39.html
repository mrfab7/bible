<div class="chapter" data-book="Jeremiah" data-chapter="39" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, by the gate between the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But the Chaldeans’ army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do to him even as he shall say to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon’s princes;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelled among the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Now the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words on this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day before you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But I will deliver you in that day, said the LORD: and you shall not be given into the hand of the men of whom you are afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For I will surely deliver you, and you shall not fall by the sword, but your life shall be for a prey to you: because you have put your trust in me, said the LORD.</p>
