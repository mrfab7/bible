  <verse number="1">Be not thou envious of evil men, Neither desire to be with them.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For their heart studieth destruction, And their lips talk of mischief.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Through wisdom is a house builded; And by understanding it is established;</verse>
  <verse number="4">And by knowledge are the chambers filled With all precious and pleasant riches.</verse>
  <verse number="5">A wise man is strong; Yea, a man of knowledge increaseth strength.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For with wise advice thou shalt make thy war; And in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Wisdom is as unattainable to a fool as corals; He openeth not his mouth in the gate.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He that deviseth to do evil, Men shall call him a mischievous person.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The thought of foolishness is sin; And the scorner is an abomination to men.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If thou faint in the day of adversity, Thy strength is small indeed.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Deliver them that are drawn unto death; And those that are ready to be slain wilt thou forbear to rescue?</verse>
  <verse number="12">If thou sayest: ‘Behold, we knew not this’, Doth not He that weigheth the hearts consider it? And He that keepeth thy soul, doth not He know it? And shall not He render to every man according to his works?</verse>
  <verse number="13">My son, eat thou honey, for it is good, And the honeycomb is sweet to thy taste;</verse>
  <verse number="14">So know thou wisdom to be unto thy soul; If thou hast found it, then shall there be a future, And thy hope shall not be cut off.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Lie not in wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous, Spoil not his resting-place;</verse>
  <verse number="16">For a righteous man falleth seven times, and riseth up again, But the wicked stumble under adversity.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, And let not thy heart be glad when he stumbleth;</verse>
  <verse number="18">Lest the LORD see it, and it displease Him, And He turn away His wrath from him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Fret not thyself because of evildoers, Neither be thou envious at the wicked;</verse>
  <verse number="20">For there will be no future to the evil man, The lamp of the wicked shall be put out.</verse>
  <verse number="21">My son, fear thou the LORD and the king, And meddle not with them that are given to change;</verse>
  <verse number="22">For their calamity shall rise suddenly; And who knoweth the ruin from them both?</verse>
  <verse number="23">These also are sayings of the wise. To have respect of persons in judgment is not good.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He that saith unto the wicked: ‘Thou art righteous’, Peoples shall curse him, nations shall execrate him;</verse>
  <verse number="25">But to them that decide justly shall be delight, And a good blessing shall come upon them.</verse>
  <verse number="26">He kisseth the lips That giveth a right answer.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Prepare thy work without, And make it fit for thyself in the field; And afterwards build thy house.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; And deceive not with thy lips.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Say not: ‘I will do so to him as he hath done to me; I will render to the man according to his work.’</verse>
  <verse number="30">I went by the field of the slothful, And by the vineyard of the man void of understanding;</verse>
  <verse number="31">And, lo, it was all grown over with thistles, The face thereof was covered with nettles, And the stone wall thereof was broken down.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Then I beheld, and considered well; I saw, and received instruction.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, A little folding of the hands to sleep’—</verse>
  <verse number="34">So shall thy poverty come as a runner, And thy want as an armed man.</verse>
