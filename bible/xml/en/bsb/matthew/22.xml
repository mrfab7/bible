  <verse number="1">Once again, Jesus spoke to them in parables:</verse>
  <verse number="2">“The kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son.</verse>
  <verse number="3">He sent his servants to call those he had invited to the banquet, but they refused to come.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Again, he sent other servants and said, ‘Tell those who have been invited that I have prepared my dinner. My oxen and fattened cattle have been killed, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding banquet.’</verse>
  <verse number="5">But they paid no attention and went away, one to his field, another to his business.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The rest seized his servants, mistreated them, and killed them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The king was enraged, and he sent his troops to destroy those murderers and burn their city.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those I invited were not worthy.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Go therefore to the crossroads and invite to the banquet as many as you can find.’</verse>
  <verse number="10">So the servants went out into the streets and gathered everyone they could find, both evil and good, and the wedding hall was filled with guests.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But when the king came in to see the guests, he spotted a man who was not dressed in wedding clothes.</verse>
  <verse number="12">‘Friend,’ he asked, ‘how did you get in here without wedding clothes?’ But the man was speechless.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then the king told the servants, ‘Tie him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’</verse>
  <verse number="14">For many are called, but few are chosen.”</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then the Pharisees went out and conspired to trap Jesus in His words.</verse>
  <verse number="16">They sent their disciples to Him along with the Herodians. “Teacher,” they said, “we know that You are honest and that You teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. You seek favor from no one, because You pay no attention to external appearance.</verse>
  <verse number="17">So tell us what You think: Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”</verse>
  <verse number="18">But Jesus knew their evil intent and said, “You hypocrites, why are you testing Me?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Show Me the coin used for the tax.” And they brought Him a denarius.</verse>
  <verse number="20">“Whose image is this,” He asked, “and whose inscription?”</verse>
  <verse number="21">“Caesar’s,” they answered. So Jesus told them, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”</verse>
  <verse number="22">And when they heard this, they were amazed. So they left Him and went away.</verse>
  <verse number="23">That same day the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and questioned Him.</verse>
  <verse number="24">“Teacher,” they said, “Moses declared that if a man dies without having children, his brother is to marry the widow and raise up offspring for him.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died without having children. So he left his wife to his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="26">The same thing happened to the second and third brothers, down to the seventh.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And last of all, the woman died.</verse>
  <verse number="28">In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be of the seven? For all of them were married to her.”</verse>
  <verse number="29">Jesus answered, “You are mistaken because you do not know the Scriptures or the power of God.</verse>
  <verse number="30">In the resurrection, people will neither marry nor be given in marriage. Instead, they will be like the angels in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="31">But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what God said to you:</verse>
  <verse number="32">‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.”</verse>
  <verse number="33">When the crowds heard this, they were astonished at His teaching.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they themselves gathered together.</verse>
  <verse number="35">One of them, an expert in the law, tested Him with a question:</verse>
  <verse number="36">“Teacher, which commandment is the greatest in the Law?”</verse>
  <verse number="37">Jesus declared, “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’</verse>
  <verse number="38">This is the first and greatest commandment.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’</verse>
  <verse number="40">All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”</verse>
  <verse number="41">While the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus questioned them:</verse>
  <verse number="42">“What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is He?” “David’s,” they answered.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Jesus said to them, “How then does David in the Spirit call Him ‘Lord’? For he says:</verse>
  <verse number="44">‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at My right hand until I put Your enemies under Your feet.”’</verse>
  <verse number="45">So if David calls Him ‘Lord,’ how can He be David’s son?”</verse>
  <verse number="46">No one was able to answer a word, and from that day on no one dared to question Him any further.</verse>
