  <verse number="1">The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Now at that time the king of Babylon’s army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah’s house.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;</verse>
  <verse number="5">and he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="7">Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum thine uncle shall come unto thee, saying, Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">So Hanamel mine uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of the LORD, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And I bought the field that was in Anathoth of Hanamel mine uncle’s son, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And I subscribed the deed, and sealed it, and called witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances.</verse>
  <verse number="11">So I took the deed of the purchase, both that which was sealed, according to the law and custom, and that which was open:</verse>
  <verse number="12">and I delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the presence of Hanamel mine uncle’s son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the deed of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the guard.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And I charged Baruch before them, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, this deed of the purchase, both that which is sealed, and this deed which is open, and put them in an earthen vessel; that they may continue many days.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall yet again be bought in this land.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Now after I had delivered the deed of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the LORD, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="17">Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and by thy stretched out arm; there is nothing too hard for thee:</verse>
  <verse number="18">which shewest mercy unto thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the great, the mighty God, the LORD of hosts is his name:</verse>
  <verse number="19">great in counsel, and mighty in work: whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men; to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings:</verse>
  <verse number="20">which didst set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, both in Israel and among other men; and madest thee a name, as at this day;</verse>
  <verse number="21">and didst bring forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;</verse>
  <verse number="22">and gavest them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing milk and honey;</verse>
  <verse number="23">and they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:</verse>
  <verse number="24">Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest it.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for money, and call witnesses; whereas the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="27">Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?</verse>
  <verse number="28">Therefore thus saith the LORD: Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:</verse>
  <verse number="29">and the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done that which was evil in my sight from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="31">For this city hath been to me a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face:</verse>
  <verse number="32">because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.</verse>
  <verse number="34">But they set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination; to cause Judah to sin.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence:</verse>
  <verse number="37">Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:</verse>
  <verse number="38">and they shall be my people, and I will be their God:</verse>
  <verse number="39">and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever; for the good of them, and of their children after them:</verse>
  <verse number="40">and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.</verse>
  <verse number="42">For thus saith the LORD: Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.</verse>
  <verse number="43">And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, It is desolate, without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans;</verse>
  <verse number="44">Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds, and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the hill country, and cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the South: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the LORD.</verse>
