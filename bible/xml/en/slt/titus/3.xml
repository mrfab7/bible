  <verse number="2">To slander none, to be without fighting, equitable, showing all meekness to all men.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For once we also were unwise disobedient, deceived, being slaves to eager desires and various pleasures, living in vexation and envy, hated, and hating one another.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And when the kindness and philanthropy of our Saviour God was made evident,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Not of works in justice which we did; but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and the renovation of the Holy Spirit;</verse>
  <verse number="6">Which he poured out upon us richly by Jesus Christ our Saviour;</verse>
  <verse number="7">That justified by his grace, we might be heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
