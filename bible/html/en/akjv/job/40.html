<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Shall he that contends with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproves God, let him answer it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer you? I will lay my hand on my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yes, twice; but I will proceed no further.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then answered the LORD to Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Gird up your loins now like a man: I will demand of you, and declare you to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Will you also cancel my judgment? will you condemn me, that you may be righteous?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Have you an arm like God? or can you thunder with a voice like him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Deck yourself now with majesty and excellency; and array yourself with glory and beauty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Cast abroad the rage of your wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then will I also confess to you that your own right hand can save you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold now behemoth, which I made with you; he eats grass as an ox.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">See now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He moves his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He lies under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Behold, he drinks up a river, and hastens not: he trusts that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He takes it with his eyes: his nose pierces through snares.</p>
