<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Sarai will say to Abram, My wrong upon thee: I gave my maid servant into thy bosom, and she will see that she conceived, and I shall be despised in her eyes. Jehovah will judge between me and between thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Abram will say to Sarai, Behold thy maid servant in thy hand; do to her the good in thine eyes. And Sarai shall afflict her, and she will flee from her face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the messenger of Jehovah shall find her by a fountain of water in the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he will say, Hagar, Sarai’s maid servant, how camest thou here? and whither wilt thou go? And she will say, I flee from the face of Sarai, my mistress.</p>
