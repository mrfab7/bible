  <verse number="1">And when they drew near to Jerusalem, and were come to Bethphage, to the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Saying to them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway you shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose them, and bring them to me.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And if any man say ought to you, you shall say, The Lord has need of them; and straightway he will send them.</verse>
  <verse number="4">All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="5">Tell you the daughter of Sion, Behold, your King comes to you, meek, and sitting on an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,</verse>
  <verse number="7">And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed them in the way.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,</verse>
  <verse number="13">And said to them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he healed them.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased,</verse>
  <verse number="16">And said to him, Hear you what these say? And Jesus said to them, Yes; have you never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have perfected praise?</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and he lodged there.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungry.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said to it, Let no fruit grow on you henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!</verse>
  <verse number="21">Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; it shall be done.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And all things, whatever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority do you these things? and who gave you this authority?</verse>
  <verse number="24">And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell me, I in like wise will tell you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The baptism of John, from where was it? from heaven, or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say to us, Why did you not then believe him?</verse>
  <verse number="26">But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said to them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But what think you? A certain man had two sons; and he came to the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.</verse>
  <verse number="29">He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Whether of them two did the will of his father? They say to him, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and you, when you had seen it, repented not afterward, that you might believe him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and dig a wine press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to farmers, and went into a far country:</verse>
  <verse number="34">And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the farmers, that they might receive the fruits of it.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And the farmers took his servants, and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did to them likewise.</verse>
  <verse number="37">But last of all he sent to them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.</verse>
  <verse number="38">But when the farmers saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his inheritance.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.</verse>
  <verse number="40">When the lord therefore of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?</verse>
  <verse number="41">They say to him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard to other farmers, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</verse>
  <verse number="42">Jesus said to them, Did you never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?</verse>
  <verse number="43">Therefore say I to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="44">And whoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke of them.</verse>
  <verse number="46">But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude, because they took him for a prophet.</verse>
