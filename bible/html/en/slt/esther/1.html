<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the king will say to the wise knowing the times, (for thus spake the king before all knowing the edict and judgment:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And there drew near to him Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, Memucan, seven chiefs of Persia and Media, seeing the face of the king, sitting the first in the kingdom;)</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Memucan will say before the king, Not against the king alone did Vashti the queen do evil, but against all the chiefs and against all the peoples that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For the word of the queen will go forth ball the women to cause their husbands to be despised in their eyes, in their saying, The king Ahasuerus said to bring in Vashti the queen before him, and she came not.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If good to the king, the word of the kingdom shall go forth from before him, and it shall be written in the edict of the Persians and Medea, and it shall not pass away, that Vashti shall not come before the king Ahasuerus; and the king shall give her kingdom to her companion good above her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And the decree of the king which he shall make being heard in all his kingdom, (for it is great,) and all the women shall give honor to their husbands, to the great and even to the small.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the word will be good in the eyes of the king and the chiefs; and the king will do according to the word of Memucan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And he will send letters to all the provinces of the king, to provinces and provinces, according to its writing, and to people and people, according to their tongue, for every man to be ruling in his house; and being spoken according to the tongue of his people.</p>
