<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly vocation, consider the apostle and high priest of our confession, Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Who is faithful to him that made him, as was also Moses in all his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For this man was counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by so much as he that hath built the house, hath greater honour than the house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For every house is built by some man: but he that created all things, is God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But Christ as the Son in his own house: which house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and glory of hope unto the end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith: To day if you shall hear his voice,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation; in the day of temptation in the desert,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Where your fathers tempted me, proved and saw my works,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Forty years: for which cause I was offended with this generation, and I said: They always err in heart. And they have not known my ways,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">As I have sworn in my wrath: If they shall enter into my rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Take heed, brethren, lest perhaps there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, to depart from the living God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But exhort one another every day, whilst it is called to day, that none of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For we are made partakers of Christ: yet so, if we hold the beginning of his substance firm unto the end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">While it is said, To day if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in that provocation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For some who heard did provoke: but not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And with whom was he offended forty years? Was it not with them that sinned, whose carcasses were overthrown in the desert?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And to whom did he swear, that they should not enter into his rest: but to them that were incredulous?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And we see that they could not enter in, because of unbelief.</p>
