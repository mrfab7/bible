<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith:—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">To God is a man profitable, Because a wise man to himself is profitable?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is it a delight to the Mighty One That thou art righteous? is it gain, That thou makest perfect thy ways?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Because of thy reverence Doth He reason with thee? He entereth with thee into judgment:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Is not thy wickedness abundant? And there is no end to thine iniquities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For thou takest a pledge of thy brother for nought, And the garments of the naked Thou dost strip off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thou causest not the weary to drink water, And from the hungry thou withholdest bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">As to the man of arm—he hath the earth, And the accepted of face—he dwelleth in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Widows thou hast sent away empty, And the arms of the fatherless are bruised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore round about thee are snares, And trouble thee doth fear suddenly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Or darkness—thou dost not see, And abundance of waters doth cover thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Is not God high in heaven? And see the summit of the stars, That they are high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And thou hast said, ‘What—hath God known? Through thickness doth He judge?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thick clouds are a secret place to Him, And He doth not see;’ And the circle of the heavens He walketh habitually,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The path of the age dost thou observe, That men of iniquity have trodden?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Who have been cut down unexpectedly, A flood is poured out on their foundation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Those saying to God, ‘Turn aside from us,’ And what doth the Mighty One to them?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he hath filled their houses with good: (And the counsel of the wicked Hath been far from me.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">See do the righteous and they rejoice, And the innocent mocketh at them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">‘Surely our substance hath not been cut off, And their excellency hath fire consumed.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Acquaint thyself, I pray thee, with Him, And be at peace, Thereby thine increase is good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Receive, I pray thee, from His mouth a law, And set His sayings in thy heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If thou dost return unto the Mighty Thou art built up, Thou puttest iniquity far from thy tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">So as to set on the dust a defence, And on a rock of the valleys a covering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And the Mighty hath been thy defence, And silver is strength to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For then on the Mighty thou delightest thyself, And dost lift up unto God thy face,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Thou dost make supplication unto Him, And He doth hear thee, And thy vows thou completest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And thou decreest a saying, And it is established to thee, And on thy ways hath light shone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For they have made low, And thou sayest, ‘Lift up.’ And the bowed down of eyes he saveth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He delivereth the not innocent, Yea, he hath been delivered By the cleanness of thy hands.</p>
