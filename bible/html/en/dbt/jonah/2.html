<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jonah prayed unto Jehovah his God out of the fishâ€™s belly;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and he said: I cried by reason of my distress unto Jehovah, and he answered me; Out of the belly of Sheol cried I: thou heardest my voice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For thou didst cast me into the depth, into the heart of the seas, And the flood was round about me: All thy breakers and thy billows are gone over me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I said, I am cast out from before thine eyes, Yet will I look again toward thy holy temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The waters encompassed me, to the soul: The deep was round about me, The weeds were wrapped about my head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; The bars of the earth [closed] upon me for ever: But thou hast brought up my life from the pit, O Jehovah my God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">When my soul fainted within me, I remembered Jehovah; And my prayer came in unto thee, Into thy holy temple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Jehovah commanded the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry [land].</p>
