  <verse number="1">Sons ye are to Jehovah your God; ye do not cut yourselves, nor make baldness between your eyes for the dead;</verse>
  <verse number="2">for a holy people art thou to Jehovah thy God, and on thee hath Jehovah fixed to be to Him for a people, a peculiar treasure, out of all the peoples who are on the face of the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="3">‘Thou dost not eat any abominable thing;</verse>
  <verse number="4">this is the beast which ye do eat: ox, lamb of the sheep, or kid of the goats,</verse>
  <verse number="5">hart, and roe, and fallow deer, and wild goat, and pygarg, and wild ox, and chamois;</verse>
  <verse number="6">and every beast dividing the hoof, and cleaving the cleft into two hoofs, bringing up the cud, among the beasts—it ye do eat.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Only, this ye do not eat, of those bringing up the cud, and of those dividing the cloven hoof: the camel, and the hare, and the rabbit, for they are bringing up the cud but the hoof have not divided; unclean they are to you;</verse>
  <verse number="8">and the sow, for it is dividing the hoof, and not bringing up the cud, unclean it is to you; of their flesh ye do not eat, and against their carcase ye do not come.</verse>
  <verse number="9">This ye do eat of all that are in the waters; all that hath fins and scales ye do eat;</verse>
  <verse number="10">and anything which hath not fins and scales ye do not eat; unclean it is to you.</verse>
  <verse number="11">‘Any clean bird ye do eat;</verse>
  <verse number="12">and these are they of which ye do not eat: the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,</verse>
  <verse number="13">and the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after its kind,</verse>
  <verse number="14">and every raven after its kind;</verse>
  <verse number="15">and the owl, and the night-hawk, and the cuckoo, and the hawk after its kind;</verse>
  <verse number="16">the little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,</verse>
  <verse number="17">and the pelican, and the gier-eagle, and the cormorant,</verse>
  <verse number="18">and the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the lapwing, and the bat;</verse>
  <verse number="19">and every teeming thing which is flying, unclean it is to you; they are not eaten;</verse>
  <verse number="20">any clean fowl ye do eat.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Ye do not eat of any carcase; to the sojourner who is within thy gates thou dost give it, and he hath eaten it; or sell it to a stranger; for a holy people thou art to Jehovah thy God; thou dost not boil a kid in its mother’s milk.</verse>
  <verse number="22">‘Thou dost certainly tithe all the increase of thy seed which the field is bringing forth year by year;</verse>
  <verse number="23">and thou hast eaten before Jehovah thy God, in the place where He doth choose to cause His name to tabernacle, the tithe of thy corn, of thy new wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herd, and of thy flock, so that thou dost learn to fear Jehovah thy God all the days.</verse>
  <verse number="24">‘And when the way is too much for thee, that thou art not able to carry it—when the place is too far off from thee which Jehovah thy God doth choose to put His name there, when Jehovah thy God doth bless thee;—</verse>
  <verse number="25">then thou hast given it in money, and hast bound up the money in thy hand, and gone unto the place on which Jehovah thy God doth fix;</verse>
  <verse number="26">and thou hast given the money for any thing which thy soul desireth, for oxen, and for sheep, and for wine, and for strong drink, and for any thing which thy soul asketh, and thou hast eaten there before Jehovah thy God, and thou hast rejoiced, thou and thy house.</verse>
  <verse number="27">As to the Levite who is within thy gates, thou dost not forsake him, for he hath no portion and inheritance with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="28">At the end of three years thou dost bring out all the tithe of thine increase in that year, and hast placed it within thy gates;</verse>
  <verse number="29">and come in hath the Levite (for he hath no part and inheritance with thee), and the sojourner, and the fatherless, and the widow, who are within thy gates, and they have eaten, and been satisfied, so that Jehovah thy God doth bless thee in all the work of thy hand which thou dost.</verse>
