<chapter book="Isaiah" number="64" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">If only You would rend the heavens and come down, so that mountains would quake at Your presence,</verse>
  <verse number="2">as fire kindles the brushwood and causes the water to boil, to make Your name known to Your enemies, so that the nations will tremble at Your presence!</verse>
  <verse number="3">When You did awesome works that we did not expect, You came down, and the mountains trembled at Your presence.</verse>
  <verse number="4">From ancient times no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen any God besides You, who acts on behalf of those who wait for Him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">You welcome those who gladly do right, who remember Your ways. Surely You were angry, for we sinned. How can we be saved if we remain in our sins?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Each of us has become like something unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all wither like a leaf, and our iniquities carry us away like the wind.</verse>
  <verse number="7">No one calls on Your name or strives to take hold of You. For You have hidden Your face from us and delivered us into the hand of our iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But now, O LORD, You are our Father; we are the clay, and You are the potter; we are all the work of Your hand.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Do not be angry, O LORD, beyond measure; do not remember our iniquity forever. Oh, look upon us, we pray; we are all Your people!</verse>
  <verse number="10">Your holy cities have become a wilderness. Zion has become a wasteland and Jerusalem a desolation.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Our holy and beautiful temple, where our fathers praised You, has been burned with fire, and all that was dear to us lies in ruins.</verse>
  <verse number="12">After all this, O LORD, will You restrain Yourself? Will You keep silent and afflict us beyond measure?</verse>
