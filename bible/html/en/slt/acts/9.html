<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Saul, yet breathing out threatening and murder against the disciples of the Lord, having come to the chief priest,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">He asked of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues, so that if he find certain men being of the way, and also women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And in going, it was he drawing near to Damascus: and suddenly a light from heaven flashed with lightning around him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And having fallen upon the earth, he heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, Why drivest thou me out?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom thou drivest out: hard for thee to kick against goads.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he trembling and amazed said, Lord, What wilt thou me to do? And the Lord to him, Arise, and come into the city, and it shall be spoken to thee what thou must do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the men journeying with him stood astonished, hearing the voice truly, and seeing no one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Saul was raised up from the earth; and his eyes being opened, he saw no one: and leading him by the hand, they brought him to Damascus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he was three days not seeing, and he ate not, nor drank.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And a certain disciple was in Damascus, Ananias by name; and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I, Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And the Lord to him, Having risen, go thou to the street called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas Saul by name, of Tarsus; for, behold, he prays,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And he saw in a vision a man, by name Ananias, coming in, and having put hand upon him, so that he might look up and see again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many of this man, how many evils he did to thy holy ones in Jerusalem:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And here has he authority from the chief priests to bind all those calling on thy name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the Lord said to him, Go: for he is a vessel of choice to me, to lift up my name before nations, and kings, and the sons of Israel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For I will show him what he must suffer for my name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Ananias departed, and came into the house; and having put hands upon him said, Brother Saul, the Lord has sent me, Jesus, he seen to thee in the way which thou earnest, so that thou mightest look up, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And quickly there fell from his eyes as scales: and he immediately looked up, and having risen, he was immersed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And having taken food, he was strong. And Saul was in Damascus with the disciples certain days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And quickly in the synagogues he proclaimed Jesus, that he is the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And all they hearing were affected in mind, and said: Is not this he having laid waste in Jerusalem those calling upon this name, and he has come here for this, that he might bring them having been bound to the chief priests?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Saul was the more strengthened, and confounded the Jews dwelling in Damascus, demonstrating that this is the Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And when sufficient days were completed, the Jews counselled together to put him to death:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But this project was known to Saul. And they observed narrowly the gates day, and also night, that they might kill him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And the disciples having taken him by night, put through the wall, having let down in a wicker basket.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And Saul being present in Jerusalem, tried to join himself to the disciples: and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he is a disciple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And Barnabas having taken him, brought him to the sent, and recounted to them how in the way he saw the Lord, and that he spake to him, and how in Damascus he spake freely in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And he was with them going in and going out in Jerusalem, and speaking freely in the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And he spake and sought out with the Greeks; but they purposed to kill him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And the brethren having known, brought him down to Cesarea, and they sent him forth to Tarsus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Then truly the churches through the Whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria, had peace, being built up; and going in the fear of the Lord, and in the consolation of the Holy Spirit, were multiplied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And it was Peter, passing through all, came down also to the holy ones dwelling in Lydda.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And he found there a certain man, Eneas by name, lying upon a bed of eight years, who was affected with palsy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And Peter said to him, Eneas, Jesus Christ heals thee; arise, and cover thyself. And he arose quickly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And all dwelling in Lydda and Saron saw him, who turned back to the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And in Joppa was a certain disciple by name Tabitha, which interpreted is called Dorcas: she was full of good works and alms which she did.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And it was in those days, having been sick, she died; and having washed, they laid her in an upper room.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And Lydda being near Joppa, the disciples having heard that Peter is in it, sent to him two men, beseeching not to hesitate to pass through even to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And Peter having risen came with them. Whom having approached, they brought into the upper room: and all the widows stood before him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, being with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And Peter having put them all without, having set the knees, prayed; and having turned back to the body he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and having seen Peter, sat up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And having given her the hand, he raised her up, and having called the holy ones and the widows, he placed her living before them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And it was known through the whole of Joppa: and many believed upon the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And days sufficient he remained in Joppa with a certain Simon, a currier.</p>
