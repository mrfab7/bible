  <verse number="1">After this Jesus moved from place to place in Galilee. He would not go about in Judaea, because the Jews were seeking an opportunity to kill Him.</verse>
  <verse number="2">But the Jewish Festival of the Tent-Pitching was approaching.</verse>
  <verse number="3">So His brothers said to Him, “Leave these parts and go into Judaea, that not only we but your disciples also may witness the miracles which you perform.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For no one acts in secret, desiring all the while to be himself known publicly. Since you are doing these things, show yourself openly to the world.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">For even His brothers were not believers in Him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">“My time,” replied Jesus, “has not yet come, but for you any time is suitable.</verse>
  <verse number="7">It is impossible for the world to hate you; but me it does hate, because I give testimony concerning it that its conduct is evil.</verse>
  <verse number="8">As for you, go up to the Festival. I do not now go up to this Festival, because my time is not yet fully come.”</verse>
  <verse number="9">Such was His answer, and He remained in Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="10">When however His brothers had gone up to the Festival, then He also went up, not openly, but as it were privately.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Meanwhile the Jews at the Festival were looking for Him and were inquiring, “Where is he?”</verse>
  <verse number="12">Among the mass of the people there was much muttered debate about Him. Some said, “He is a good man.” Others said, “Not so: he is imposing on the people.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke out boldly about Him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But when the Festival was already half over, Jesus went up to the Temple and commenced teaching.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The Jews were astonished. “How does this man know anything of books,” they said, “although he has never been at any of the schools?”</verse>
  <verse number="16">Jesus answered their question by saying, “My teaching does not belong to me, but comes from Him who sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">If any one is willing to do His will, he shall know about the teaching, whether it is from God or originates with me.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The man whose teaching originates with himself aims at his own glory. He who aims at the glory of Him who sent him teaches the truth, and there is no deception in him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Did not Moses give you the Law? And yet not a man of you obeys the Law. Why do you want to kill me?”</verse>
  <verse number="20">“You are possessed by a demon,” replied the crowd; “no one wants to kill you.”</verse>
  <verse number="21">“One deed I have done,” replied Jesus, “and you are all full of wonder.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Consider therefore. Moses gave you the rite of circumcision (not that it began with Moses, but with your earlier forefathers)</verse>
  <verse number="23">If a child is circumcised even on a Sabbath day, are you bitter against me because I have restored a man to perfect health on a Sabbath day?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Do not form superficial judgements, but form the judgements that are just.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">Some however of the people of Jerusalem said, “Is not this the man they are wanting to kill?</verse>
  <verse number="26">But here he is, speaking openly and boldly, and they say nothing to him! Can the Rulers really have ascertained that this man is the Christ?</verse>
  <verse number="27">And yet we know this man, and we know where he is from; but as for the Christ, when He comes, no one can tell where He is from.”</verse>
  <verse number="28">Jesus therefore, while teaching in the Temple, cried aloud, and said, “Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from. And yet I have not come of my own accord; but there is One who has sent me, an Authority indeed, of whom you have no knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="29">I know Him, because I came from Him, and He sent me.”</verse>
  <verse number="30">On hearing this they wanted to arrest Him; yet not a hand was laid on Him, because His time had not yet come.</verse>
  <verse number="31">But from among the crowd a large number believed in Him. “When the Christ comes,” they said, “will He perform more miracles than this teacher has performed?”</verse>
  <verse number="32">The Pharisees heard the people thus expressing their various doubts about Him, and the High Priests and the Pharisees sent some officers to apprehend Him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">So Jesus said, “Still for a short time I am with you, and then I go my way to Him who sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="34">You will look for me and will not find me, and where I am you cannot come.”</verse>
  <verse number="35">The Jews therefore said to one another, “Where is he about to betake himself, so that we shall not find him? Will he betake himself to the Dispersion among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</verse>
  <verse number="36">What do those words of his mean, ‘You will look for me, but will not find me, and where I am you cannot come’?”</verse>
  <verse number="37">On the last day of the Festival—the great day—Jesus stood up and cried aloud. “Whoever is thirsty,” He said, “let him come to me and drink.</verse>
  <verse number="38">He who believes in me, from within him—as the Scripture has said—rivers of living water shall flow.”</verse>
  <verse number="39">He referred to the Spirit which those who believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not bestowed as yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</verse>
  <verse number="40">After listening to these discourses, some of the crowd began to say, “This is beyond doubt the Prophet.”</verse>
  <verse number="41">Others said, “He is the Christ.” But others again, “Not so, for is the Christ to come from Galilee?</verse>
  <verse number="42">Has not the Scripture declared that the Christ is to come of the family of David and from Bethlehem, David’s village?”</verse>
  <verse number="43">So there was a violent dissension among the people on His account.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Some of them wanted at once to arrest Him, but no one laid hands upon Him.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Meanwhile the officers returned to the High Priests and Pharisees, who asked them, “Why have you not brought him?”</verse>
  <verse number="46">“No mere man has ever spoken as this man speaks,” said the officers.</verse>
  <verse number="47">“Are *you* deluded too?” replied the Pharisees;</verse>
  <verse number="48">“has any one of the Rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?</verse>
  <verse number="49">But this rabble who understand nothing about the Law are accursed!”</verse>
  <verse number="50">Nicodemus interposed—he who had formerly gone to Jesus, being himself one of them.</verse>
  <verse number="51">“Does our Law,” he asked, “judge a man without first hearing what he has to say and ascertaining what his conduct is?”</verse>
  <verse number="52">“Do you also come from Galilee?” they asked in reply. “Search and see for yourself that no Prophet is of Galilaean origin.”</verse>
  <verse number="53">So they went away to their several homes;</verse>
