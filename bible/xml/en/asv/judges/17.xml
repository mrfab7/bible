  <verse number="1">And there was a man of the hill-country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred pieces of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou didst utter a curse, and didst also speak it in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be my son of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he restored the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother; and his mother said, I verily dedicate the silver unto Jehovah from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And when he restored the money unto his mother, his mother took two hundred pieces of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and it was in the house of Micah.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.</verse>
  <verse number="6">In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And there was a young man out of Beth-lehem-judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he sojourned there.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the man departed out of the city, out of Beth-lehem-judah, to sojourn where he could find a place, and he came to the hill-country of Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Beth-lehem-judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten pieces of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then said Micah, Now know I that Jehovah will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest.</verse>
