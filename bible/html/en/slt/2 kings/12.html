<p class="verse" data-verse="1">In the seventh year to Jehu, Jehoash reigned; and forty years he reigned in Jerusalem And his mother’s name Zibiah, from the Well of the Oath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Jehoash will do the straight in the eyes of Jehovah all his days which Jehoida the priest taught him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Only the heights were not removed; the people yet sacrificing and burning incense upon the heights.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Jehoash will say to the priests, All the silver of the holies which shall come to the house of Jehovah, the silver of a man passing by, the silver of the souls of his estimation, all the silver which shall come up upon the heart of a man to bring in to the house of Jehovah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The priests shall take to themselves a man from his selling; and they shall make firm the breach of the house to all which a breach shall be found there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And it will be in the year the twenty and third year to king Jehoash, and the priests strengthened not the breach of the house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And king Jehoash will call for Jehoida the priest, and for the priests, and he will say to them, Wherefore are ye not strengthening the breach of the house? now ye shall not take silver from the selling, for ye shall give it for the breach of the house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the priests will consent not to take silver from the people, and not to strengthen the breach of the house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Jehoida the priest will take one ark and bore a hole in its door, and he will give it by the altar on the right in a man’s coming to the house of Jehovah: and the priests watching the threshold will give there all the silver being brought to the house of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And it will be when they saw much silver was in the ark, and the king’s scribe will come up, and the great priest, and they will bind together, and number the silver found in the house of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And they gave the silver being prepared into the hand of those doing the work of those overseeing the house of Jehovah: and they will bring forth to the artificers of wood, and to the builders doing the house of Jehovah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And to those building the wall, and to the cutters of stone, and to buy woods and stones being cut to strengthen the breach of the house of Jehovah, and for all which went forth upon the house to strengthen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But there shall not be made for the house of Jehovah silver dishes, snuffers, vases, trumpets, any vessels of gold and vessels of silver from the silver being brought to the house of Jehovah:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For they shall give to those doing the work, and they strengthened with it the house of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And they will not reckon with the men which they will give the silver into their hand to give to those doing the work, for they do in faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The silver of trespass and the silver of sins shall not come into the house of Jehovah: it shall be to the priests.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Then Hazael king of Aram will go up and war against Gath, and he will take it: and Hazael will set his face to go up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Jehoash king of Judah will take all the holy things which Jehoshaphat, and Jehoram, and Ahaziah his fathers, kings of Judah, consecrated, and his holy things, and all the gold found in the treasures of the house of Jehovah, and the king’s house, and he will send to Hazael king of Aram: and he will go up from Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And the rest of the words of Joash, and all which he did, are they not written upon the book of the words of the days to the kings of Judah?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And his servants will arise and conspire a conspiracy, and strike Joash in the house of the fortress going down to Silla.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Jozachar son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad son of Shomer, his servants, will smite him, and he will die; and they will bury him with his fathers in the city of David: and Amaziah his son will reign in his stead.</p>
