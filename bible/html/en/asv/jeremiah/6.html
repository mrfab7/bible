<div class="chapter" data-book="Jeremiah" data-chapter="6" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Flee for safety, ye children of Benjamin, out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise up a signal on Beth-haccherem; for evil looketh forth from the north, and a great destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The comely and delicate one, the daughter of Zion, will I cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe unto us! for the day declineth, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For thus hath Jehovah of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast up a mound against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">As a well casteth forth its waters, so she casteth forth her wickedness: violence and destruction is heard in her; before me continually is sickness and wounds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated from thee; lest I make thee a desolation, a land not inhabited.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn again thy hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of Jehovah is become unto them a reproach; they have no delight in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Therefore I am full of the wrath of Jehovah; I am weary with holding in: pour it out upon the children in the street, and upon the assembly of young men together; for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And their houses shall be turned unto others, their fields and their wives together; for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one dealeth falsely.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">They have healed also the hurt of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall; at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Thus saith Jehovah, Stand ye in the ways and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way; and walk therein, and ye shall find rest for your souls: but they said, We will not walk therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet; but they said, We will not hearken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words; and as for my law, they have rejected it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">To what purpose cometh there to me frankincense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices pleasing unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people; and the fathers and the sons together shall stumble against them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Thus saith Jehovah, Behold, a people cometh from the north country; and a great nation shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea, and they ride upon horses, every one set in array, as a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Zion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">We have heard the report thereof; our hands wax feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, and pangs as of a woman in travail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy, and terror, are on every side.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">I have made thee a trier and a fortress among my people; that thou mayest know and try their way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">They are all grievous revolters, going about with slanders; they are brass and iron: they all of them deal corruptly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">The bellows blow fiercely; the lead is consumed of the fire: in vain do they go on refining; for the wicked are not plucked away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Refuse silver shall men call them, because Jehovah hath rejected them.</p>
