<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the messenger speaking with me will turn back and rouse me up as a man that will be roused from his sleep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he will say to me, What seest thou? And saying, I saw, and behold, a candlestick of gold, all of it, and a bowl upon its head, and its seven lights upon it, and seven tubes to the seven lights which were upon its head:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And two olive trees upon it, one from the right of the bowl and one from its left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I shall answer and say to the messenger speaking with me, saying, What are these, my lord?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the messenger speaking with me will answer and say to me, Knewest thou not what these are? And saying, No, my lord.</p>
