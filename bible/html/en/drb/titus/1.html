<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the elect of God and the acknowledging of the truth, which is according to godliness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Unto the hope of life everlasting, which God, who lieth not, hath promised before the times of the world:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But hath in due times manifested his word in preaching, which is committed to me according to the commandment of God our Savior:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">To Titus my beloved son, according to the common faith, grace and peace from God the Father, and from Christ Jesus our Savior.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and shouldest ordain priests in every city, as I also appointed thee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If any be without crime, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, not accused of riot, or unruly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For a bishop must be without crime, as the steward of God: not proud, not subject to anger, not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But given to hospitality, gentle, sober, just, holy, continent:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Embracing that faithful word which is according to doctrine, that he may be able to exhort in sound doctrine, and to convince the gainsayers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For there are also many disobedient, vain talkers, and seducers: especially they who are of the circumcision:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Who must be reproved, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucreâ€™s sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">One of them a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slothful bellies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">This testimony is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men, who turn themselves away from the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All things are clean to the clean: but to them that are defiled, and to unbelievers, nothing is clean: but both their mind and their conscience are defiled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">They profess that they know God: but in their works they deny him; being abominable, and incredulous, and to every good work reprobate.</p>
