<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the whole earth had one language, and the same words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and dwelt there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they said one to another, Come on, let us make bricks, and burn [them] thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and they had asphalt for mortar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they said, Come on, let us build ourselves a city and a tower, the top of which [may reach] to the heavens; and let us make ourselves a name, lest we be scattered over the face of the whole earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Jehovah came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men built.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Jehovah said, Behold, the people is one, and have all one language; and this have they begun to do. And now will they be hindered in nothing that they meditate doing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Come, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another’s speech.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Jehovah scattered them thence over the face of the whole earth. And they left off building the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Therefore was its name called Babel; because Jehovah there confounded the language of the whole earth. And Jehovah scattered them thence over the face of the whole earth.</p>
