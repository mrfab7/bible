  <verse number="1">Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:</verse>
  <verse number="2">“If one ventures a word with you, will you be wearied? Yet who can keep from speaking?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Surely you have instructed many, and have strengthened their feeble hands.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Your words have steadied those who stumbled; you have braced the knees that were buckling.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But now trouble has come upon you, and you are weary. It strikes you, and you are dismayed.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Is your reverence not your confidence, and the uprightness of your ways your hope?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Consider now, I plead: Who, being innocent, has ever perished? Or where have the upright been destroyed?</verse>
  <verse number="8">As I have observed, those who plow iniquity and those who sow trouble reap the same.</verse>
  <verse number="9">By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of His anger they are consumed.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The lion may roar, and the fierce lion may growl, yet the teeth of the young lions are broken.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now a word came to me secretly; my ears caught a whisper of it.</verse>
  <verse number="13">In disquieting visions in the night, when deep sleep falls on men,</verse>
  <verse number="14">fear and trembling came over me and made all my bones shudder.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then a spirit glided past my face, and the hair on my body bristled.</verse>
  <verse number="16">It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance; a form loomed before my eyes, and I heard a whispering voice:</verse>
  <verse number="17">‘Can a mortal be more righteous than God, or a man more pure than his Maker?</verse>
  <verse number="18">If God puts no trust in His servants, and He charges His angels with error,</verse>
  <verse number="19">how much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundations are in the dust, who can be crushed like a moth!</verse>
  <verse number="20">They are smashed to pieces from dawn to dusk; unnoticed, they perish forever.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Are not their tent cords pulled up, so that they die without wisdom?’</verse>
