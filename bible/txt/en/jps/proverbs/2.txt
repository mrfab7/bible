1	My son, if thou wilt receive my words, And lay up my commandments with thee;
2	So that thou make thine ear attend unto wisdom, And thy heart incline to discernment;
3	Yea, if thou call for understanding, And lift up thy voice for discernment;
4	If thou seek her as silver, And search for her as for hid treasures;
5	Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, And find the knowledge of God.
6	For the LORD giveth wisdom, Out of His mouth cometh knowledge and discernment;
7	He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright, He is a shield to them that walk in integrity;
8	That He may guard the paths of justice, And preserve the way of His godly ones.
9	Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice, And equity, yea, every good path.
10	For wisdom shall enter into thy heart, And knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul;
11	Discretion shall watch over thee, Discernment shall guard thee;
12	To deliver thee from the way of evil, From the men that speak froward things;
13	Who leave the paths of uprightness, To walk in the ways of darkness;
14	Who rejoice to do evil, And delight in the frowardness of evil;
15	Who are crooked in their ways, And perverse in their paths;
16	To deliver thee from the strange woman, Even from the alien woman that maketh smooth her words;
17	That forsaketh the lord of her youth, And forgetteth the covenant of her God.
18	For her house sinketh down unto death, And her paths unto the shades;
19	None that go unto her return, Neither do they attain unto the paths of life;
20	That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, And keep the paths of the righteous.
21	For the upright shall dwell in the land, And the whole-hearted shall remain in it.
22	But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, And the faithless shall be plucked up out of it.
