  <verse number="1">And when any will offer a meat offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense thereon:</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests: and he shall take out of there his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it on the altar, to be an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And if you bring an oblation of a meat offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And if your oblation be a meat offering baked in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.</verse>
  <verse number="6">You shall part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a meat offering.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And if your oblation be a meat offering baked in the frying pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And you shall bring the meat offering that is made of these things to the LORD: and when it is presented to the priest, he shall bring it to the altar.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn it on the altar: it is an offering made by fire, of a sweet smell to the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron’s and his sons’: it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.</verse>
  <verse number="11">No meat offering, which you shall bring to the LORD, shall be made with leaven: for you shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire.</verse>
  <verse number="12">As for the oblation of the first fruits, you shall offer them to the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet smell.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And every oblation of your meat offering shall you season with salt; neither shall you suffer the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your meat offering: with all your offerings you shall offer salt.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And if you offer a meat offering of your first fruits to the LORD, you shall offer for the meat offering of your first fruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn beaten out of full ears.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And you shall put oil on it, and lay frankincense thereon: it is a meat offering.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire to the LORD.</verse>
