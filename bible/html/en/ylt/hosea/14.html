<div class="chapter" data-book="Hosea" data-chapter="14" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Turn back, O Israel, unto Jehovah thy God, For thou hast stumbled by thine iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Take with you words, and turn to Jehovah, Say ye unto Him: ‘Take away all iniquity, and give good, And we do render the fruit of our lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Asshur doth not save us, on a horse we ride not, Nor do we say any more, Our God, to the work of our hands, For in Thee find mercy doth the fatherless.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I heal their backsliding, I love them freely, For turned back hath Mine anger from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I am as dew to Israel, he flourisheth as a lily, And he striketh forth his roots as Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Go on do his sucklings, And his beauty is as an olive, And he hath fragrance as Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Return do the dwellers under his shadow, They revive as corn, and flourish as a vine, His memorial is as wine of Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">O Ephraim, what to Me any more with idols? I—I afflicted, and I cause him to sing: ‘I am as a green fir-tree,’ From Me is thy fruit found.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who is wise, and doth understand these? Prudent, and knoweth them? For upright are the ways of Jehovah, And the righteous go on in them, And the transgressors stumble therein!</p>
