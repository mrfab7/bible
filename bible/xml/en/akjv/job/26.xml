  <verse number="2">How have you helped him that is without power? how save you the arm that has no strength?</verse>
  <verse number="3">How have you counceled him that has no wisdom? and how have you plentifully declared the thing as it is?</verse>
  <verse number="4">To whom have you uttered words? and whose spirit came from you?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Hell is naked before him, and destruction has no covering.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He stretches out the north over the empty place, and hangs the earth on nothing.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He binds up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He holds back the face of his throne, and spreads his cloud on it.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He has compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.</verse>
  <verse number="12">He divides the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smites through the proud.</verse>
  <verse number="13">By his spirit he has garnished the heavens; his hand has formed the crooked serpent.</verse>
  <verse number="14">See, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?</verse>
