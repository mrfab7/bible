<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Pilate therefore went forth again, and saith to them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then Jesus came forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And Pilate saith to them, Behold the man!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">When therefore the chief priests and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. Pilate saith to them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And went again into the judgment-hall, and saith to Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then saith Pilate to him, Speakest thou not to me? knowest thou not, that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Jesus answered, Thou couldst have no power against me; except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me to thee hath the greater sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Cesar’s friend. Whoever maketh himself a king, speaketh against Cesar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">When Pilate therefore heard that saying, he brought Jesus forth, and sat down on the judgment-seat, in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith to the Jews, Behold your King!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate saith to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Cesar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Then therefore he delivered him to them to be crucified. And they took Jesus, and led him away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Where they crucified him, and two others with him, on each side one, and Jesus in the midst.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Many of the Jews then read this title: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Then said the chief priests of the Jews to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Pilate answered, What I have written, I have written.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Now there stood by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith to his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her to his own home.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I thirst.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and expired.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath, (for that sabbath was a great day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Then came the soldiers, and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who was crucified with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they broke not his legs:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came out blood and water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And he that saw it, testified, and his testimony is true: and he knoweth that he speaketh truth, that ye may believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And after this, Joseph of Arimathea (being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews) besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore and took the body of Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And there came also Nicodemus (who at the first came to Jesus by night) and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pound weight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Then they took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen cloths, with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Now in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulcher, in which was never man yet laid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">There they laid Jesus therefore, because of the Jews’ preparation-day, for the sepulcher was nigh at hand.</p>
