<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Bel bent; Nebo bowed down; their images were for the beast and for the cattle: your gifts were carried; a lifting up to the weary.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">They bowed down, they bent together; they were not able to deliver the burden and their soul went into captivity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Hear to me, ye house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, being carried from the belly, being lifted up from the womb:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">find even to old age I am he; and even to grayness I will bear; I made and I will lift up, and I will bear, and I will deliver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">To whom will ye liken me and make equal? and compare me and we shall be like?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Squandering gold out of the bag and they will weigh silver in the balance, they will hire a founder, and he will make it a god: they will fall down, they will also worship.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They will lift him up upon the shoulder, they will carry him, they will set him down in his place and he will stand; from his place he shall not depart: also he will cry out to him and he will not answer; he will not save him from his straits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Remember this, shew yourselves men: turn back, ye transgressing, upon the heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Remember the former things from forever: for I am God and no god besides, and none like me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Announcing the last part from the beginning, and from of old what was not done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my delight:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Calling a ravenous beast from the sunrising, from a land afar off a man of my counsel: also I spake, also I will bring it; I formed, also I will do it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Hear to me, ye strong of heart, being far from justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">I brought near my justice; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not delay: and I gave salvation in Zion for Israel my beauty.</p>
