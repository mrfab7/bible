<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, To the oppressing city!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">She hearkened not the voice, She received not correction; She trusted not in the LORD, She drew not near to her God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions; Her judges are wolves of the desert, They leave not a bone for the morrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Her prophets are wanton And treacherous persons; Her priests have profaned that which is holy, They have done violence to the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The LORD who is righteous is in the midst of her, He will not do unrighteousness; Every morning doth He bring His right to light, It faileth not; But the unrighteous knoweth no shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I have cut off nations, Their corners are desolate; I have made their streets waste, So that none passeth by; Their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, So that there is no inhabitant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I said: ‘Surely thou wilt fear Me, Thou wilt receive correction; So her dwelling shall not be cut off, Despite all that I have visited upon her’; But they betimes corrupted all their doings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Therefore wait ye for Me, saith the LORD, Until the day that I rise up to the prey; For My determination is to gather the nations, That I may assemble the kingdoms, To pour upon them Mine indignation, Even all My fierce anger; For all the earth shall be devoured With the fire of My jealousy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For then will I turn to the peoples A pure language, That they may all call upon the name of the LORD, To serve Him with one consent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia Shall they bring My suppliants, Even the daughter of My dispersed, As Mine offering.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, Wherein thou hast transgressed against Me; For then I will take away out of the midst of thee Thy proudly exulting ones, And thou shalt no more be haughty In My holy mountain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And I will leave in the midst of thee An afflicted and poor people, And they shall take refuge in the name of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, Nor speak lies, Neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth; For they shall feed and lie down, And none shall make them afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Sing, O daughter of Zion, Shout, O Israel; Be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, He hath cast out thine enemy; The King of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee; Thou shalt not fear evil any more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem: ‘Fear thou not; O Zion, let not thy hands be slack.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The LORD thy God is in the midst of thee, A Mighty One who will save; He will rejoice over thee with joy, He will be silent in His love, He will joy over thee with singing.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I will gather them that are far from the appointed season, who are of thee, That hast borne the burden of reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee; And I will save her that is lame, And gather her that was driven away; And I will make them to be a praise and a name, Whose shame hath been in all the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">At that time will I bring you in, And at that time will I gather you; For I will make you to be a name and a praise Among all the peoples of the earth, When I turn your captivity before your eyes, Saith the LORD.</p>
