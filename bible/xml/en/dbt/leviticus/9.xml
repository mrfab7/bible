  <verse number="1">And it came to pass on the eighth day, [that] Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and said to Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin-offering, and a ram for a burnt-offering, without blemish, and present [them] before Jehovah;</verse>
  <verse number="3">and to the children of Israel shalt thou speak, saying, Take a buck of the goats for a sin-offering, and a calf and a lamb, yearlings, without blemish, for a burnt-offering;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and a bullock and a ram for a peace-offering, to sacrifice before Jehovah; and an oblation mingled with oil; for to-day Jehovah will appear to you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And they brought what Moses commanded before the tent of meeting; and all the assembly approached and stood before Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded that ye should do; and the glory of Jehovah shall appear to you.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Moses said unto Aaron, Go to the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for the people; and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them, as Jehovah has commanded.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And Aaron went to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin-offering which was for himself;</verse>
  <verse number="9">and the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put [it] on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the fat, and the kidneys, and the net above the liver, of the sin-offering, he burned on the altar, as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he slaughtered the burnt-offering; and Aaron’s sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled on the altar round about.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And they delivered the burnt-offering to him, in the pieces thereof, and the head; and he burned [them] on the altar.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he washed the inwards and the legs, and burned [them] upon the burnt-offering, on the altar.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And he presented the people’s offering, and took the goat of the sin-offering which was for the people and slaughtered it, and offered it for sin, as the first.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he presented the burnt-offering and offered it according to the ordinance.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he presented the oblation, and took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar, besides the burnt-offering of the morning.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And he slaughtered the bullock and the ram of the sacrifice of peace-offering which was for the people. And Aaron’s sons delivered to him the blood, and he sprinkled it on the altar round about;</verse>
  <verse number="19">and the pieces of fat of the bullock and of the ram, the fat tail and what covers [the inwards], and the kidneys, and the net of the liver;</verse>
  <verse number="20">and they put the pieces of fat on the breast-pieces, and he burned the pieces of fat on the altar;</verse>
  <verse number="21">and the breast-pieces and the right shoulder Aaron waved as a wave-offering before Jehovah, as Moses had commanded.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and came down after the offering of the sin-offering, and the burnt-offering, and the peace-offering.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting, and came out and blessed the people; and the glory of Jehovah appeared to all the people.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And there went out fire from before Jehovah, and consumed on the altar the burnt-offering, and the pieces of fat; and all the people saw it, and they shouted, and fell on their face.</verse>
