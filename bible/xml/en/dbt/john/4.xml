  <verse number="1">When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus makes and baptises more disciples than John</verse>
  <verse number="2">(however, Jesus himself did not baptise, but his disciples),</verse>
  <verse number="3">he left Judaea and went away again unto Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And he must needs pass through Samaria.</verse>
  <verse number="5">He comes therefore to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near to the land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now a fountain of Jacob’s was there; Jesus therefore, being wearied with the way he had come, sat just as he was at the fountain. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
  <verse number="7">A woman comes out of Samaria to draw water. Jesus says to her, Give me to drink</verse>
  <verse number="8">(for his disciples had gone away into the city that they might buy provisions).</verse>
  <verse number="9">The Samaritan woman therefore says to him, How dost thou, being a Jew, ask to drink of me who am a Samaritan woman? for Jews have no intercourse with Samaritans.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Jesus answered and said to her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that says to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The woman says to him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou the living water?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Jesus answered and said to her, Every one who drinks of this water shall thirst again;</verse>
  <verse number="14">but whosoever drinks of the water which I shall give him shall never thirst for ever, but the water which I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up into eternal life.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The woman says to him, Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst nor come here to draw.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Jesus says to her, Go, call thy husband, and come here.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The woman answered and said, I have not a husband. Jesus says to her, Thou hast well said, I have not a husband;</verse>
  <verse number="18">for thou hast had five husbands, and he whom now thou hast is not thy husband: this thou hast spoken truly.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The woman says to him, Sir, I see that thou art a prophet.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where one must worship.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Jesus says to her, Woman, believe me, [the] hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Ye worship ye know not what; we worship what we know, for salvation is of the Jews.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But [the] hour is coming and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for also the Father seeks such as his worshippers.</verse>
  <verse number="24">God [is] a spirit; and they who worship him must worship [him] in spirit and truth.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The woman says to him, I know that Messias is coming, who is called Christ; when he comes he will tell us all things.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Jesus says to her, I who speak to thee am [he].</verse>
  <verse number="27">And upon this came his disciples, and wondered that he spoke with a woman; yet no one said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?</verse>
  <verse number="28">The woman then left her waterpot and went away into the city, and says to the men,</verse>
  <verse number="29">Come, see a man who told me all things I had ever done: is not he the Christ?</verse>
  <verse number="30">They went out of the city and came to him.</verse>
  <verse number="31">But meanwhile the disciples asked him saying, Rabbi, eat.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But he said to them, I have food to eat which ye do not know.</verse>
  <verse number="33">The disciples therefore said to one another, Has any one brought him [anything] to eat?</verse>
  <verse number="34">Jesus says to them, My food is that I should do the will of him that has sent me, and that I should finish his work.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Do not ye say, that there are yet four months and the harvest comes? Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes and behold the fields, for they are already white to harvest.</verse>
  <verse number="36">He that reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto life eternal, that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For in this is [verified] the true saying, It is one who sows and another who reaps.</verse>
  <verse number="38">I have sent you to reap that on which ye have not laboured; others have laboured, and ye have entered into their labours.</verse>
  <verse number="39">But many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him because of the word of the woman who bore witness, He told me all things that I had ever done.</verse>
  <verse number="40">When therefore the Samaritans came to him they asked him to abide with them, and he abode there two days.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And more a great deal believed on account of his word;</verse>
  <verse number="42">and they said to the woman, [It is] no longer on account of thy saying that we believe, for we have heard him ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="43">But after the two days he went forth thence and went away into Galilee,</verse>
  <verse number="44">for Jesus himself bore witness that a prophet has no honour in his own country.</verse>
  <verse number="45">When therefore he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem during the feast, for they also went to the feast.</verse>
  <verse number="46">He came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain courtier in Capernaum whose son was sick.</verse>
  <verse number="47">He, having heard that Jesus had come out of Judaea into Galilee, went to him and asked [him] that he would come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.</verse>
  <verse number="48">Jesus therefore said to him, Unless ye see signs and wonders ye will not believe.</verse>
  <verse number="49">The courtier says to him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</verse>
  <verse number="50">Jesus says to him, Go, thy son lives. And the man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and went his way.</verse>
  <verse number="51">But already, as he was going down, his servants met him and brought [him] word saying, Thy child lives.</verse>
  <verse number="52">He inquired therefore from them the hour at which he got better. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</verse>
  <verse number="53">The father therefore knew that [it was] in that hour in which Jesus said to him, Thy son lives; and he believed, himself and his whole house.</verse>
  <verse number="54">This second sign again did Jesus, being come out of Judaea into Galilee.</verse>
