<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="9" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Wisdom has built her house, she has hewn out her seven pillars:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">She has killed her beasts; she has mingled her wine; she has also furnished her table.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">She has sent forth her maidens: she cries on the highest places of the city,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Whoever is simple, let him turn in here: as for him that wants understanding, she said to him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He that reproves a scorner gets to himself shame: and he that rebukes a wicked man gets himself a blot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate you: rebuke a wise man, and he will love you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For by me your days shall be multiplied, and the years of your life shall be increased.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">If you be wise, you shall be wise for yourself: but if you scorn, you alone shall bear it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knows nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For she sits at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">To call passengers who go right on their ways:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Whoever is simple, let him turn in here: and as for him that wants understanding, she said to him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But he knows not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.</p>
