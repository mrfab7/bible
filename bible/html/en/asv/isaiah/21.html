<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The burden of the wilderness of the sea.As whirlwinds in the South sweep through, it cometh from the wilderness, from a terrible land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous man dealeth treacherously, and the destroyer destroyeth. Go up, O Elam; besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Therefore are my loins filled with anguish; pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman in travail: I am pained so that I cannot hear; I am dismayed so that I cannot see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">My heart fluttereth, horror hath affrighted me; the twilight that I desired hath been turned into trembling unto me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">They prepare the table, they set the watch, they eat, they drink: rise up, ye princes, anoint the shield.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman: let him declare what he seeth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">and when he seeth a troop, horsemen in pairs, a troop of asses, a troop of camels, he shall hearken diligently with much heed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he cried as a lion: O Lord, I stand continually upon the watch-tower in the day-time, and am set in my ward whole nights;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and, behold, here cometh a troop of men, horsemen in pairs. And he answered and said, Fallen, fallen is Babylon; and all the graven images of her gods are broken unto the ground.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">O thou my threshing, and the grain of my floor! that which I have heard from Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The burden of Dumah.One calleth unto me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will inquire, inquire ye: turn ye, come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The burden upon Arabia.In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye caravans of Dedanites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Unto him that was thirsty they brought water; the inhabitants of the land of Tema did meet the fugitives with their bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For they fled away from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall fail;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be few; for Jehovah, the God of Israel, hath spoken it.</p>
