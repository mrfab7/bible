  <verse number="1">My son, attend unto my wisdom, incline thine ear to my understanding;</verse>
  <verse number="2">that thou mayest keep reflection, and that thy lips may preserve knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the lips of the strange woman drop honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil;</verse>
  <verse number="4">but her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on Sheol.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Lest she should ponder the path of life, her ways wander, she knoweth not [whither].</verse>
  <verse number="7">And now, children, hearken unto me, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:</verse>
  <verse number="9">lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel;</verse>
  <verse number="10">lest strangers be filled with thy wealth, and the fruits of thy toil [come] into the house of a stranger;</verse>
  <verse number="11">and thou mourn in thine end, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed;</verse>
  <verse number="12">and thou say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof!</verse>
  <verse number="13">and I have not hearkened unto the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to those that instructed me;</verse>
  <verse number="14">I was well nigh in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Thy fountains shall be poured forth, as water-brooks in the broadways.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Let them be only thine own, and not strangers’ with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Let thy fountain be blessed; and have joy of the wife of thy youth.</verse>
  <verse number="19">As a lovely hind and a graceful roe, let her breasts satisfy thee at all times: be thou ravished continually with her love.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</verse>
  <verse number="21">For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah, and he pondereth all his paths.</verse>
  <verse number="22">His own iniquities shall take the wicked, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He shall die for want of discipline; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</verse>
