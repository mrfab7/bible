<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Listen, my sons, to a father’s instruction; pay attention and gain understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For I give you sound teaching; do not abandon my directive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">When I was a son to my father, tender and the only child of my mother,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">he taught me and said, “Let your heart lay hold of my words; keep my commands and you will live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Get wisdom, get understanding; do not forget my words or turn from them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Do not forsake wisdom, and she will preserve you; love her, and she will guard you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Wisdom is supreme; so acquire wisdom. And whatever you may acquire, gain understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Prize her, and she will exalt you; if you embrace her, she will honor you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">She will set a garland of grace on your head; she will present you with a crown of beauty.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Listen, my son, and receive my words, and the years of your life will be many.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I will guide you in the way of wisdom; I will lead you on straight paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When you walk, your steps will not be impeded; when you run, you will not stumble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hold on to instruction; do not let go. Guard it, for it is your life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evildoers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Avoid it; do not travel on it. Turn from it and pass on by.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For they cannot sleep unless they do evil; they are deprived of slumber until they make someone fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The path of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn, shining brighter and brighter until midday.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">But the way of the wicked is like the darkest gloom; they do not know what makes them stumble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My son, pay attention to my words; incline your ear to my sayings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Do not lose sight of them; keep them within your heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For they are life to those who find them, and health to the whole body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Guard your heart with all diligence, for from it flow springs of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Put away deception from your mouth; keep your lips from perverse speech.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Let your eyes look forward; fix your gaze straight ahead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Make a level path for your feet, and all your ways will be sure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your feet away from evil.</p>
