<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Job will answer and say,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Also today is my complaint bitter: my hand heavy over my groaning,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Who will give, I knew to find him: I will come even to his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I will arrange judgment before him, and I will fill the mouth with proofs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I shall know the words he will answer me, and I shall understand what he will say to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Will he contend with me in great power? No; but he will put in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">There the upright one disputed with him; and I shall be delivered forever from my judge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Behold, I shall go before, and he is not; and behind, I shall not understand for him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The left hand in his working, and I shall not behold: he will cover himself on the right hand, and I shall not see.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For he knew the way with me: he tried me; I shall come forth as gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My foot laid hold upon his going, I watched his way and not softly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">From the command of his lips and I will not waver; from his law I hid the words of his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And he is in one, and who shall turn him back? and his soul desired, and he will do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For he will finish my appointing: and many such with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For this I shall tremble from his face: I shall consider, and I shall be afraid of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">God relaxed my heart, and the Almighty caused me to tremble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">For I was not cut off from the face of darkness, and he covered misfortune from my face.</p>
