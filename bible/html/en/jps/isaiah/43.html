<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, And He that formed thee, O Israel: Fear not, for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee by thy name, thou art Mine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee, And through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee; When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned, Neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I am the LORD thy God, The Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour; I have given Egypt as thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Since thou art precious in My sight, and honourable, And I have loved thee; Therefore will I give men for thee, And peoples for thy life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Fear not, for I am with thee; I will bring thy seed from the east, And gather thee from the west;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I will say to the north: ‘Give up’, And to the south: ‘Keep not back, Bring My sons from far, And My daughters from the end of the earth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Every one that is called by My name, And whom I have created for My glory, I have formed him, yea, I have made him.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The blind people that have eyes shall be brought forth, And the deaf that have ears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">All the nations are gathered together, And the peoples are assembled; Who among them can declare this, And announce to us former things? Let them bring their witnesses, that they may be justified; And let them hear, and say: ‘It is truth.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Ye are My witnesses, saith the LORD, And My servant whom I have chosen; That ye may know and believe Me, and understand That I am He; Before Me there was no God formed, Neither shall any be after Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I, even I, am the LORD; And beside Me there is no saviour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I have declared, and I have saved, And I have announced, And there was no strange god among you; Therefore ye are My witnesses, saith the LORD, and I am God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Yea, since the day was I am He, And there is none that can deliver out of My hand; I will work, and who can reverse it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Thus saith the LORD, your Redeemer, The Holy One of Israel: For your sake I have sent to Babylon, And I will bring down all of them as fugitives, Even the Chaldeans, in the ships of their shouting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I am the LORD, your Holy One, The Creator of Israel, your King.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Thus saith the LORD, who maketh a way in the sea, And a path in the mighty waters;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Who bringeth forth the chariot and horse, The army and the power—They lie down together, they shall not rise, They are extinct, they are quenched as a wick:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Remember ye not the former things, Neither consider the things of old.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Behold, I will do a new thing; Now shall it spring forth; shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, And rivers in the desert.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The beasts of the field shall honour Me, The jackals and the ostriches; Because I give waters in the wilderness, And rivers in the desert, To give drink to My people, Mine elect;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The people which I formed for Myself, That they might tell of My praise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Yet thou hast not called upon Me, O Jacob, Neither hast thou wearied thyself about Me, O Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Thou hast not brought Me the small cattle of thy burnt-offerings; Neither hast thou honoured Me with thy sacrifices. I have not burdened thee with a meal-offering, Nor wearied thee with frankincense.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Thou hast bought Me no sweet cane with money, Neither hast thou satisfied Me with the fat of thy sacrifices; But thou hast burdened Me with thy sins, Thou hast wearied Me with thine iniquities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">I, even I, am He that blotteth out thy transgressions for Mine own sake; And thy sins I will not remember.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Put Me in remembrance, let us plead together; Declare thou, that thou mayest be justified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Thy first father sinned, And thine intercessors have transgressed against Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, And I have given Jacob to condemnation, And Israel to reviling.</p>
