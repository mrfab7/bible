<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My brethren, be not many teachers, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For in many things we all offend. If any man offendeth not in word, the same is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Behold, we put bits in the mouths of horses, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Behold also the ships, which though they are so great, and are driven by fierce winds, yet they are turned about with a very small helm, withersoever the governor willeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire from hell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of animals in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed by mankind:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">With this we bless God, even the Father; and with this we curse men, who are made after the similitude of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Can the fig-tree, my brethren, bear olive-berries? or a vine, figs? so no fountain can yield both salt water and fresh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him show by a good deportment his works with meekness of wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, demoniacal.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace by them that make peace.</p>
