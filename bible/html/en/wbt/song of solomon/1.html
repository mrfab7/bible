<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The song of songs, which is Solomon’s.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Because of the savor of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers; we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother’s children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but my own vineyard have I not kept.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">If thou knowest not, O thou fairest among women, go forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds tents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh’s chariots.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">We will make for thee borders of gold with studs of silver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth its smell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">A bundle of myrrh is my well beloved to me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">My beloved is to me as a cluster of camphor in the vineyards of En-gedi.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves’ eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yes, pleasant: also our bed is green.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.</p>
