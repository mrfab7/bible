  <verse number="1">And Job answered and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Even to-day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Oh that I knew where I might find him, that I might come to his seat!</verse>
  <verse number="4">I would order the cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments;</verse>
  <verse number="5">I would know the words he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Would he plead against me with [his] great power? Nay; but he would give heed unto me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">There would an upright man reason with him; and I should be delivered for ever from my judge.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Lo, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I do not perceive him;</verse>
  <verse number="9">On the left hand, where he doth work, but I behold [him] not; he hideth himself on the right hand, and I see [him] not.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But he knoweth the way that I take; he trieth me, I shall come forth as gold.</verse>
  <verse number="11">My foot hath held to his steps; his way have I kept, and not turned aside.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have laid up the words of his mouth more than the purpose of my own heart.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But he is in one [mind], and who can turn him? And what his soul desireth, that will he do.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For he will perform [what] is appointed for me; and many such things are with him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Therefore am I troubled at his presence; I consider, and I am afraid of him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For God hath made my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me;</verse>
  <verse number="17">Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he hidden the gloom from me.</verse>
