<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I am a rose of Sharon, A lily of the valleys.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">As a lily among thorns, So is my love among the daughters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">As an apple-tree among the trees of the wood, So is my beloved among the sons. Under its shadow I delighted to sit, And its fruit was sweet to my taste.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He hath brought me to the banqueting-house, And his banner over me is love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Stay ye me with dainties, refresh me with apples; For I am love-sick.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Let his left hand be under my head, And his right hand embrace me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles, and by the hinds of the field, That ye awaken not, nor stir up love, until it please.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Hark! my beloved! behold, he cometh, Leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart; Behold, he standeth behind our wall, He looketh in through the windows, He peereth through the lattice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">My beloved spoke, and said unto me: ‘Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For, lo, the winter is past, The rain is over and gone;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The flowers appear on the earth; The time of singing is come, And the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The fig-tree putteth forth her green figs, And the vines in blossom give forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the covert of the cliff, Let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; For sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vineyards; For our vineyards are in blossom.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">My beloved is mine, and I am his, That feedeth among the lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Until the day breathe, and the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be thou like a gazelle or a young hart Upon the mountains of spices.</p>
