1	And thou saidst in that day, I will praise thee, O Jehovah: for thou wert angry with me, thine anger will turn back and thou wilt comfort me,
2	Behold God my salvation; I will trust and not be afraid: for my strength and song is Jah Jehovah, and he will be to me for salvation.
3	Ye drew water with gladness from the fountains of salvation.
4	And ye said in that day, Praise ye to Jehovah, call upon his name; make known his deeds among the peoples; keep ye in remembrance that his name was exalted.
5	Strike the chords to Jehovah, for he did a lifting up: this being known in all the earth.
6	Cry out and shout for joy thou inhabitress of Zion, for great in the midst of thee the Holy One of Israel.
