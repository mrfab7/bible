<div class="chapter" data-book="2 Corinthians" data-chapter="5" data-translation="King James Bible" data-translation-id="kjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">For we know that if our earthly house of [this] tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For we that are in [this] tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing [is] God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Therefore [we are] always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">(For we walk by faith, not by sight:)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">We are confident, [I say], and willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things [done] in [his] body, according to that he hath done, whether [it be] good or bad.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to [answer] them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For whether we be beside ourselves, [it is] to God: or whether we be sober, [it is] for your cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For the love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And [that] he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we [him] no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Therefore if any man [be] in Christ, [he is] a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And all things [are] of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">To wit, that God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech [you] by us: we pray [you] in Christâ€™s stead, be ye reconciled to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For he hath made him [to be] sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.</p>
