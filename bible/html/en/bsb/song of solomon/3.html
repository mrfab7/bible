<p class="verse" data-verse="1">On my bed at night I sought the one I love; I sought him, but did not find him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I will arise now and go about the city, through the streets and squares. I will seek the one I love. So I sought him but did not find him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I encountered the watchmen on their rounds of the city: “Have you seen the one I love?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I had just passed them when I found the one I love. I held him and would not let go until I had brought him to my mother’s house, to the chamber of the one who conceived me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">O daughters of Jerusalem, I adjure you by the gazelles and does of the field: Do not arouse or awaken love until the time is right.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Who is this coming up from the wilderness like a column of smoke, scented with myrrh and frankincense from all the spices of the merchant?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, it is Solomon’s carriage, escorted by sixty of the mightiest men of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">All are skilled with the sword, experienced in warfare. Each has his sword at his side prepared for the terror of the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">King Solomon has made his carriage out of the timber of Lebanon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He has made its posts of silver, its base of gold, its seat of purple fabric. Its interior is inlaid with love by the daughters of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Come out, O daughters of Zion, and gaze at King Solomon, wearing the crown with which his mother crowned him on the day of his wedding—the day of his heart’s rejoicing.</p>
