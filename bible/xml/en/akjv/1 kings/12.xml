  <verse number="1">And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechem to make him king.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of king Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelled in Egypt;)</verse>
  <verse number="3">That they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he said to them, Depart yet for three days, then come again to me. And the people departed.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do you advise that I may answer this people?</verse>
  <verse number="7">And they spoke to him, saying, If you will be a servant to this people this day, and will serve them, and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be your servants for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, and which stood before him:</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he said to them, What counsel give you that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which your father did put on us lighter?</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the young men that were grown up with him spoke to him, saying, Thus shall you speak to this people that spoke to you, saying, Your father made our yoke heavy, but make you it lighter to us; thus shall you say to them, My little finger shall be thicker than my father’s loins.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke: my father has chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</verse>
  <verse number="12">So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the old men’s counsel that they gave him;</verse>
  <verse number="14">And spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Why the king listened not to the people; for the cause was from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORD spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.</verse>
  <verse number="16">So when all Israel saw that the king listened not to them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, O Israel: now see to your own house, David. So Israel departed to their tents.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But as for the children of Israel which dwelled in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="19">So Israel rebelled against the house of David to this day.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him to the congregation, and made him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscore thousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Speak to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="24">Thus said the LORD, You shall not go up, nor fight against your brothers the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They listened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelled therein; and went out from there, and built Penuel.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David:</verse>
  <verse number="27">If this people go up to do sacrifice in the house of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this people turn again to their lord, even to Rehoboam king of Judah, and they shall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold, and said to them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem: behold your gods, O Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worship before the one, even to Dan.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like to the feast that is in Judah, and he offered on the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.</verse>
  <verse number="33">So he offered on the altar which he had made in Bethel the fifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he had devised of his own heart; and ordained a feast to the children of Israel: and he offered on the altar, and burnt incense.</verse>
