<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Yet now hear, O Jacob My servant, And Israel, whom I have chosen;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thus saith the LORD that made thee, And formed thee from the womb, who will help thee: Fear not, O Jacob My servant, And thou, Jeshurun, whom I have chosen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I will pour water upon the thirsty land, And streams upon the dry ground; I will pour My spirit upon thy seed, And My blessing upon thine offspring;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they shall spring up among the grass, As willows by the watercourses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">One shall say: ‘I am the LORD’S’; And another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; And another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, And surname himself by the name of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thus saith the LORD, the King of Israel, And his Redeemer the LORD of hosts: I am the first, and I am the last, And beside Me there is no God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And who, as I, can proclaim—Let him declare it, and set it in order for Me—Since I appointed the ancient people? And the things that are coming, and that shall come to pass, let them declare.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Fear ye not, neither be afraid; Have I not announced unto thee of old, and declared it? And ye are My witnesses. Is there a God beside Me? Yea, there is no Rock; I know not any.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They that fashion a graven image are all of them vanity, And their delectable things shall not profit; And their own witnesses see not, nor know; That they may be ashamed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who hath fashioned a god, or molten an image That is profitable for nothing?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Behold, all the fellows thereof shall be ashamed; And the craftsmen skilled above men; Let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; They shall fear, they shall be ashamed together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The smith maketh an axe, And worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, And worketh it with his strong arm; Yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth; He drinketh no water, and is faint.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The carpenter stretcheth out a line; He marketh it out with a pencil; He fitteth it with planes, And he marketh it out with the compasses, And maketh it after the figure of a man, According to the beauty of a man, to dwell in the house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He heweth him down cedars, And taketh the ilex and the oak, And strengtheneth for himself one among the trees of the forest; He planteth a bay-tree, and the rain doth nourish it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Then a man useth it for fuel; And he taketh thereof, and warmeth himself; Yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; Yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; He maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He burneth the half thereof in the fire; With the half thereof he eateth flesh; He roasteth roast, and is satisfied; Yea, he warmeth himself, and saith: ‘Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire’;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image; He falleth down unto it and worshippeth, and prayeth unto it, And saith: ‘Deliver me, for thou art my god.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">They know not, neither do they understand; For their eyes are bedaubed, that they cannot see, And their hearts, that they cannot understand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And none considereth in his heart, Neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say: ‘I have burned the half of it in the fire; Yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh and eaten it; And shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? Shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He striveth after ashes, A deceived heart hath turned him aside, That he cannot deliver his soul, nor say: ‘Is there not a lie in my right hand?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Remember these things, O Jacob, And Israel, for thou art My servant; I have formed thee, thou art Mine own servant; O Israel, thou shouldest not forget Me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, And, as a cloud, thy sins; Return unto Me, for I have redeemed thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Sing, O ye heavens, for the LORD hath done it; Shout, ye lowest parts of the earth; Break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein; For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, And doth glorify Himself in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, And He that formed thee from the womb: I am the LORD, that maketh all things; That stretched forth the heavens alone; That spread abroad the earth by Myself;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">That frustrateth the tokens of the imposters, And maketh diviners mad; That turneth wise men backward, And maketh their knowledge foolish;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">That confirmeth the word of His servant, And performeth the counsel of His messengers; That saith of Jerusalem: ‘She shall be inhabited’; And of the cities of Judah: ‘They shall be built, And I will raise up the waste places thereof’;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">That saith to the deep: ‘Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers’;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">That saith of Cyrus: ‘He is My shepherd, And shall perform all My pleasure’; Even saying of Jerusalem: ‘She shall be built’; And to the temple: ‘My foundation shall be laid.’</p>
