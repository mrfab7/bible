<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Hear this, ye priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ear, O house of the king: for this judgment is for you; for ye have been a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And they have plunged themselves in the corruption of apostasy, but I will be a chastiser of them all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me; for now, Ephraim, thou hast committed whoredom; Israel is defiled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Their doings do not allow them to return unto their God; for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they know not Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Israelâ€™s pride doth testify to his face; and Israel and Ephraim shall fall by their iniquity: Judah also shall fall with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah; but they shall not find [him]: he hath withdrawn himself from them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah; for they have begotten strange children: now shall the new moon devour them, with their allotted possessions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Blow the horn in Gibeah, the trumpet in Ramah; cry aloud [at] Beth-aven: behind thee, O Benjamin!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Ephraim shall be a desolation in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I made known that which is sure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The princes of Judah are become like them that remove the landmark: I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment, because in selfwill he walked after the commandment [of man].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And I will be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his sore, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb; but he was unable to heal you, nor hath he removed your sore.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah. I, I will tear and go away; I will carry off, and there shall be none to deliver.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I will go away, I will return to my place, till they acknowledge their trespass, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek me early.</p>
