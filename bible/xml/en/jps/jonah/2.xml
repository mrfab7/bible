  <verse number="1">Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish’s belly.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he said: I called out of mine affliction Unto the LORD, and He answered me; Out of the belly of the nether-world cried I, And Thou heardest my voice.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For Thou didst cast me into the depth, In the heart of the seas, And the flood was round about me; All Thy waves and Thy billows Passed over me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And I said: ‘I am cast out From before Thine eyes’; Yet I will look again Toward Thy holy temple.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The waters compassed me about, even to the soul; The deep was round about me; The weeds were wrapped about my head.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; The earth with her bars closed upon me for ever; Yet hast Thou brought up my life from the pit, O LORD my God.</verse>
  <verse number="7">When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the LORD; And my prayer came in unto Thee, Into Thy holy temple.</verse>
  <verse number="8">They that regard lying vanities Forsake their own mercy.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But I will sacrifice unto Thee With the voice of thanksgiving; That which I have vowed I will pay. Salvation is of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the LORD spoke unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.</verse>
