<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof [is] brutish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A good [man] obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A virtuous woman [is] a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed [is] as rottenness in his bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The thoughts of the righteous [are] right: [but] the counsels of the wicked [are] deceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The words of the wicked [are] to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The wicked are overthrown, and [are] not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">[He that is] despised, and hath a servant, [is] better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A righteous [man] regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked [are] cruel.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="14">A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of [his] mouth: and the recompence of a man’s hands shall be rendered unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The way of a fool [is] right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel [is] wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A fool’s wrath is presently known: but a prudent [man] covereth shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">[He that] speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise [is] health.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue [is] but for a moment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Deceit [is] in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellers of peace [is] joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Lying lips [are] abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly [are] his delight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The righteous [is] more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The slothful [man] roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man [is] precious.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">In the way of righteousness [is] life; and [in] the pathway [thereof there is] no death.</p>
