  <verse number="1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="4">even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before him in love:</verse>
  <verse number="5">having foreordained us unto adoption as sons through Jesus Christ unto himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,</verse>
  <verse number="6">to the praise of the glory of his grace, which he freely bestowed on us in the Beloved:</verse>
  <verse number="7">in whom we have our redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,</verse>
  <verse number="8">which he made to abound toward us in all wisdom and prudence,</verse>
  <verse number="9">having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he purposed in him</verse>
  <verse number="10">unto a dispensation of the fulness of the times, to sum up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens, and the things upon the earth; in him, I say,</verse>
  <verse number="11">in whom also we were made a heritage, having been foreordained according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his will;</verse>
  <verse number="12">to the end that we should be unto the praise of his glory, we who had before hoped in Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="13">in whom ye also, having heard the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation,—in whom, having also believed, ye were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise,</verse>
  <verse number="14">which is an earnest of our inheritance, unto the redemption of God’s own possession, unto the praise of his glory.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For this cause I also, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which is among you, and which ye shew toward all the saints,</verse>
  <verse number="16">cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;</verse>
  <verse number="17">that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;</verse>
  <verse number="18">having the eyes of your heart enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,</verse>
  <verse number="19">and what the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to that working of the strength of his might</verse>
  <verse number="20">which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places,</verse>
  <verse number="21">far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:</verse>
  <verse number="22">and he put all things in subjection under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the church,</verse>
  <verse number="23">which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.</verse>
