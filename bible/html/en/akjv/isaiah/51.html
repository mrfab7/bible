<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="51" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Listen to me, you that follow after righteousness, you that seek the LORD: look to the rock from where you are hewn, and to the hole of the pit from where you are dig.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah that bore you: for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Listen to me, my people; and give ear to me, O my nation: for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment to rest for a light of the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and my arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait on me, and on my arm shall they trust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look on the earth beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Listen to me, you that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; fear you not the reproach of men, neither be you afraid of their revilings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Are you not it that has cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Are you not it which has dried the sea, the waters of the great deep; that has made the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with singing to Zion; and everlasting joy shall be on their head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I, even I, am he that comforts you: who are you, that you should be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And forget the LORD your maker, that has stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and have feared continually every day because of the fury of the oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the fury of the oppressor?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The captive exile hastens that he may be loosed, and that he should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But I am the LORD your God, that divided the sea, whose waves roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And I have put my words in your mouth, and I have covered you in the shadow of my hand, that I may plant the heavens, and lay the foundations of the earth, and say to Zion, You are my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which have drunk at the hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; you have drunken the dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth; neither is there any that takes her by the hand of all the sons that she has brought up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">These two things are come to you; who shall be sorry for you? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword: by whom shall I comfort you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Your sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the LORD, the rebuke of your God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Therefore hear now this, you afflicted, and drunken, but not with wine:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Thus said your Lord the LORD, and your God that pleads the cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of your hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; you shall no more drink it again:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict you; which have said to your soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and you have laid your body as the ground, and as the street, to them that went over.</p>
