<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, lo, [it was] the latter growth after the king’s mowings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And it came to pass, [that] when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he [is] small.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep, and did eat up a part.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he [is] small.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall [made] by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A plumbline. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again pass by them any more:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it [is] the king’s chapel, and it [is] the king’s court.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I [was] no prophet, neither [was] I a prophet’s son; but I [was] an herdman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest, Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not [thy word] against the house of Isaac.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into captivity forth of his land.</p>
