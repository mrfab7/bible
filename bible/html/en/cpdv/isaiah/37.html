<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="37" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And it happened that, when king Hezekiah had heard this, he rent his garments, and he wrapped himself in sackcloth, and he entered the house of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he sent Eliakim, who was over the house, and Shebna, the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah, the son of Amoz, the prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they said to him: “Thus says Hezekiah: This day is a day of tribulation, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy. For the sons have arrived at the time for birth, but there is not enough strength to bring them forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Perhaps, somehow, the Lord your God will hear the words of Rabshakeh, whom the king of the Assyrians, his lord, has sent to blaspheme the living God, and will rebuke the words that the Lord your God has heard. Therefore, lift up your prayers on behalf of the remnant which has been left behind.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And so the servants of king Hezekiah went to Isaiah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Isaiah said to them: “You shall say this to your lord: Thus says the Lord: Do not be afraid to face the words that you have heard, by which the servants of the king of the Assyrians blasphemed me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, I will send a spirit to him, and he will hear a message, and he will return to his own land. And I will cause him to fall by the sword, in his own land.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then Rabshakeh returned, and he found the king of the Assyrians fighting against Libnah. For he had heard that he had set out from Lachish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he heard from Tirhakah, the king of Ethiopia: “He has gone forth so that he may fight against you.” And when he had heard this, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">“You shall say this to Hezekiah, the king of Judah, saying: Do not let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you by saying: ‘Jerusalem will not be given into the hands of the king of the Assyrians.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Behold, you have heard about all that the kings of the Assyrians have done to all the lands that they have conquered, and so, how can you be delivered?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Have the gods of the nations rescued those whom my fathers have conquered: Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who were at Telassar?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Where is the king of Hamath and the king of Arpad, or the king of the city of Sepharvaim, or of Hena and Ivvah?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Hezekiah took the letter from the hand of the messengers, and he read it, and he went up to the house of the Lord, and Hezekiah spread it out in the sight of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">“O Lord of hosts, the God of Israel who sits upon the Cherubim: you alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">O Lord, incline your ear and listen. O Lord, open your eyes and see. And hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to blaspheme the living God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For truly, O Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have laid waste to countries and territories.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And they have cast their gods into the fire. For these were not gods, but the works of men’s hands, of wood and of stone. And they broke them into pieces.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And now, O Lord our God, save us from his hand. And let all the kingdoms of the earth acknowledge that you alone are Lord.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent to Hezekiah, saying: “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Because of what you have prayed to me about Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">this is the word that the Lord has spoken over him: The virgin daughter of Zion has despised you and mocked you. The daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Whom have you insulted? And whom have you blasphemed? And against whom have you lifted up your voice and raised up your eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">By the hand of your servants, you have reproached the Lord. And you have said: ‘With a multitude of my four-horse chariots, I have ascended the heights of the mountains adjoining Lebanon. And I will cut down its lofty cedars and its choice pine trees. And I will reach the top of its summit, to the forest of its Carmel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">I dug deep, and I drank water, and I dried up all the river banks with the sole of my foot.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Have you not heard what I have done to it in past times? In ancient times, I formed it. And now I have brought it forth. And it has been made so that the hills and the fortified cities would fight together, unto its destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Their inhabitants had unsteady hands. They trembled and were confused. They became like the plants of the field, and the grass of the pastures, and like the weeds on the rooftops, which wither before they are mature.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">I know your habitation, and your arrival, and your departure, and your madness against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">When you became angry against me, your arrogance rose up to my ears. Therefore, I will place a ring in your nose, and a bit between your lips. And I will turn you back on the road by which you arrived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">But this shall be a sign for you: Eat, in this year, whatever springs up on its own. And in the second year, eat fruits. But in the third year, sow and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And what will be saved from the house of Judah, and what is left behind, will form deep roots, and will bear high fruits.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For from Jerusalem, a remnant shall go forth, and salvation from mount Zion. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will accomplish this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">For this reason, thus says the Lord about the king of the Assyrians: He will not enter this city, nor shoot an arrow into it, nor overtake it with a shield, nor dig a rampart all around it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">He will return on the road by which he arrived. And into this city, he will not enter, says the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And I will protect this city, so that I may save it for my own sake, and for the sake of David, my servant.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Then the Angel of the Lord went forth and struck down, in the camp of the Assyrians, one hundred eighty-five thousand. And they arose in the morning, and behold, all these were dead bodies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And Sennacherib, the king of the Assyrians, departed and went away. And he returned and lived at Nineveh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And it happened that, as he was adoring his god in the temple of Nisroch, his sons, Adramelech and Sharezer, struck him with the sword. And they fled into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon, his son, reigned in his place.</p>
