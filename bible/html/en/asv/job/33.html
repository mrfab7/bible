<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Howbeit, Job, I pray thee, hear my speech, And hearken to all my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Behold now, I have opened my mouth; My tongue hath spoken in my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart; And that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The Spirit of God hath made me, And the breath of the Almighty giveth me life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If thou canst, answer thou me; Set thy words in order before me, stand forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Behold, I am toward God even as thou art: I also am formed out of the clay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, Neither shall my pressure be heavy upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, And I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I am clean, without transgression; I am innocent, neither is there iniquity in me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Behold, he findeth occasions against me, He counteth me for his enemy:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He putteth my feet in the stocks, He marketh all my paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Behold, I will answer thee, in this thou art not just; For God is greater than man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Why dost thou strive against him, For that he giveth not account of any of his matters?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For God speaketh once, Yea twice, though man regardeth it not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">In a dream, in a vision of the night, When deep sleep falleth upon men, In slumberings upon the bed;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Then he openeth the ears of men, And sealeth their instruction,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">That he may withdraw man from his purpose, And hide pride from man;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He keepeth back his soul from the pit, And his life from perishing by the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, And with continual strife in his bones;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">So that his life abhorreth bread, And his soul dainty food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; And his bones that were not seen stick out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Yea, his soul draweth near unto the pit, And his life to the destroyers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If there be with him an angel, An interpreter, one among a thousand, To show unto man what is right for him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Then God is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit, I have found a ransom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">His flesh shall be fresher than a child’s; He returneth to the days of his youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He prayeth unto God, and he is favorable unto him, So that he seeth his face with joy: And he restoreth unto man his righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He singeth before men, and saith, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, And it profited me not:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He hath redeemed my soul from going into the pit, And my life shall behold the light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Lo, all these things doth God work, Twice, yea thrice, with a man,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">To bring back his soul from the pit, That he may be enlightened with the light of the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: Hold thy peace, and I will speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">If thou hast anything to say, answer me: Speak, for I desire to justify thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If not, hearken thou unto me: Hold thy peace, and I will teach thee wisdom.</p>
