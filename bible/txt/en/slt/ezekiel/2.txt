1	And he will say to me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.
2	And the spirit will come into me as he spake to me, and he will cause me to stand upon my feet, and I shall bear him speaking to me.
3	And he will say to me, Son of man, I send thee to the sons of Israel, to rebellious nations who rebelled against me: they and their fathers transgressed against me even to this same day.
4	And the sons hard of face and strong of heart. I send thee to them; and say to them, Thus said the Lord Jehovah.
5	And if they will hear, and if they will desist, (for they a house of contradiction,) and they shall know that a prophet was in the midst of them.
6	And thou son of man, thou shalt not be afraid of them, and thou shalt not be afraid of their words, if rebels and thorns with thee, and thou art dwelling with scorpions: thou shalt not be afraid of their words, and thou shalt not be terrified from their face, for they a house of contradiction.
7	And speak my word to them, if they will hear and if they will desist: for they are contradiction.
8	And thou son of man, hear what I speak to thee: Thou shalt not be contradiction as the house of contradiction: open thy mouth and eat what I give to thee.
9	And I shall see, and behold, a hand sent to me; and behold, in it a roll of a book.
10	And he will spread it out before me: and it was written the face and the back side: and written upon it lamentations, sighing, and Wo.
