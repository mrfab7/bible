  <verse number="1">Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:</verse>
  <verse number="2">But I will send a fire on Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kirioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet:</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I will cut off the judge from the middle thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, said the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the which their fathers have walked:</verse>
  <verse number="5">But I will send a fire on Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;</verse>
  <verse number="7">That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in to the same maid, to profane my holy name:</verse>
  <verse number="8">And they lay themselves down on clothes laid to pledge by every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O you children of Israel? said the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But you gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:</verse>
  <verse number="15">Neither shall he stand that handles the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rides the horse deliver himself.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, said the LORD.</verse>
