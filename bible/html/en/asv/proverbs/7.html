<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="7" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, keep my words, And lay up my commandments with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Keep my commandments and live; And my law as the apple of thine eye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Bind them upon thy fingers; Write them upon the tablet of thy heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; And call understanding thy kinswoman:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">That they may keep thee from the strange woman, From the foreigner that flattereth with her words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For at the window of my house I looked forth through my lattice;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, A young man void of understanding,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Passing through the street near her corner; And he went the way to her house,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">In the twilight, in the evening of the day, In the middle of the night and in the darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And, behold, there met him a woman With the attire of a harlot, and wily of heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">(She is clamorous and wilful; Her feet abide not in her house:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now she is in the streets, now in the broad places, And lieth in wait at every corner.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">So she caught him, and kissed him, And with an impudent face she said unto him:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Sacrifices of peace-offerings are with me; This day have I paid my vows.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Therefore came I forth to meet thee, Diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I have spread my couch with carpets of tapestry, With striped cloths of the yarn of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I have perfumed my bed With myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; Let us solace ourselves with loves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For the man is not at home; He is gone a long journey:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He hath taken a bag of money with him; He will come home at the full moon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield; With the flattering of her lips she forceth him along.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He goeth after her straightway, As an ox goeth to the slaughter, Or as one in fetters to the correction of the fool;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Till an arrow strike through his liver; As a bird hasteth to the snare, And knoweth not that it is for his life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Now therefore, my sons, hearken unto me, And attend to the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Let not thy heart decline to her ways; Go not astray in her paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For she hath cast down many wounded: Yea, all her slain are a mighty host.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Her house is the way to Sheol, Going down to the chambers of death.</p>
