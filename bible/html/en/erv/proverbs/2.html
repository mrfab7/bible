<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and lay up my commandments with thee;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Yea, if thou cry after discernment, and lift up thy voice for understanding;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If thou seek her as silver, and search for her as for hid treasures;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For the LORD giveth wisdom; out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright, he is a shield to them that walk in integrity;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">That he may guard the paths of judgment, and preserve the way of his saints.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment, and equity, yea, every good path.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For wisdom shall enter into thine heart, and knowledge shall be pleasant unto thy soul;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Discretion shall watch over thee, understanding shall keep thee:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">To deliver thee from the way of evil, from the men that speak froward things;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who forsake the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of evil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Who are crooked in their ways, and perverse in their paths:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Which forsaketh the friend of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">None that go unto her return again, neither do they attain unto the paths of life:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, and they that deal treacherously shall be rooted out of it.</p>
