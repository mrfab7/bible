<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="20" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">It is a luxurious thing, wine, and inebriation is tumultuous. Anyone who is delighted by this will not be wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Just like the roaring of a lion, so also is the dread of a king. Whoever provokes him sins in his own soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Honor is for the man who separates himself from contentions. But all the foolish meddle in altercations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Because of the cold, the lazy one was not willing to plough. Therefore, in the summer, he will beg, and it will not be given to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Counsel in the heart of a man is like deep waters. But a wise man will draw it out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Many men are called merciful. But who will find a faithful man?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The just who walks in his simplicity shall leave behind him blessed sons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The king who sits on the throne of judgment scatters all evil with his gaze.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Who is able to say: “My heart is clean. I am pure from sin?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Diverse weights, diverse measures: both are abominable with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">A child may be understood by his interests: whether his works may be clean and upright.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The hearing ear and the seeing eye: the Lord has made them both.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Do not love sleep, lest deprivation oppress you. Open your eyes and be satisfied with bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">“It is bad, it is bad,” says every buyer; and when he has withdrawn, then he will boast.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">There is gold, and there are a multitude of jewels. But lips of knowledge are a precious vessel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Take away the vestments of him who stands up to vouch for a stranger, and take a pledge from him instead of from outsiders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The bread of lies is sweet to a man. But afterwards, his mouth will be filled with pebbles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Plans are strengthened by counsels. And wars are to be handled by governments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Do not become involved with him who reveals mysteries, and who walks deceitfully, and who enlarges his lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Whoever curses his father and mother, his lamp will be extinguished in the midst of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">When an inheritance is obtained hastily in the beginning, in the end it will be without a blessing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Do not say, “I will repay evil.” Wait for the Lord, and he will free you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Diverse weights are an abomination with the Lord. A deceitful balance is not good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The steps of men are directed by the Lord. But who is the man able to understand his own way?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">It is ruin for a man to devour what is holy, or, after making vows, to retract them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">A wise king scatters the impious and bends an archway over them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The spirit of a man is a lamp to the Lord, which investigates all the secrets of the inner self.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Mercy and truth guard the king, and his throne is strengthened by clemency.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">The joy of youths is their strength. And the dignity of old men is their grey hairs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The bruise of a wound, as well as scourges, shall wipe away evils in the more secret places of the inner self.</p>
