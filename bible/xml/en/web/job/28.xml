  <verse number="1">“Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold which they refine.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted out of the ore.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Man sets an end to darkness, and searches out, to the furthest bound, the stones of obscurity and of thick darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He breaks open a shaft away from where people live. They are forgotten by the foot. They hang far from men, they swing back and forth.</verse>
  <verse number="5">As for the earth, out of it comes bread; Underneath it is turned up as it were by fire.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Sapphires come from its rocks. It has dust of gold.</verse>
  <verse number="7">That path no bird of prey knows, neither has the falcon’s eye seen it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The proud animals have not trodden it, nor has the fierce lion passed by there.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He puts forth his hand on the flinty rock, and he overturns the mountains by the roots.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He cuts out channels among the rocks. His eye sees every precious thing.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He binds the streams that they don’t trickle. The thing that is hidden he brings forth to light.</verse>
  <verse number="12">“But where shall wisdom be found? Where is the place of understanding?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Man doesn’t know its price; Neither is it found in the land of the living.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The deep says, ‘It isn’t in me.’ The sea says, ‘It isn’t with me.’</verse>
  <verse number="15">It can’t be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for its price.</verse>
  <verse number="16">It can’t be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Gold and glass can’t equal it, neither shall it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold.</verse>
  <verse number="18">No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal. Yes, the price of wisdom is above rubies.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, Neither shall it be valued with pure gold.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Where then does wisdom come from? Where is the place of understanding?</verse>
  <verse number="21">Seeing it is hidden from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the birds of the sky.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Destruction and Death say, ‘We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.’</verse>
  <verse number="23">“God understands its way, and he knows its place.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For he looks to the ends of the earth, and sees under the whole sky.</verse>
  <verse number="25">He establishes the force of the wind. Yes, he measures out the waters by measure.</verse>
  <verse number="26">When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder;</verse>
  <verse number="27">then he saw it, and declared it. He established it, yes, and searched it out.</verse>
  <verse number="28">To man he said, ‘Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom. To depart from evil is understanding.’”</verse>
