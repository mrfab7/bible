<p class="verse" data-verse="1">This third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every matter be established.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I have declared beforehand, and I say beforehand as present the second time, and now absent, to those that have sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, (who is not weak towards you, but is powerful among you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">for if indeed he has been crucified in weakness, yet he lives by God’s power; for indeed we are weak in him, but we shall live with him by God’s power towards you,)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">examine your own selves if ye be in the faith; prove your own selves: do ye not recognise yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless indeed ye be reprobates?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Now I hope that ye will know that we are not reprobates.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But we pray to God that ye may do nothing evil; not that we may appear approved, but that ye may do what is right, and we be as reprobates.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For we rejoice when we may be weak and ye may be powerful. But this also we pray for, your perfecting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">On this account I write these things being absent, that being present I may not use severity according to the authority which the Lord has given me for building up, and not for overthrowing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the rest, brethren, rejoice; be perfected; be encouraged; be of one mind; be at peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Salute one another with a holy kiss.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">All the saints salute you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, [be] with you all.</p>
