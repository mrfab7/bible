<p class="verse" data-verse="1">AFTER these things Jesus walked in Galilee; for he would not walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Now the Jewsâ€™ feast of tabernacles was at hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And his brethren said to him: Pass from hence, and go into Judea; that thy disciples also may see thy works which thou dost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For there is no man that doth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, manifest thyself to the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For neither did his brethren believe in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then Jesus said to them: My time is not yet come; but your time is always ready.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth: because I give testimony of it, that the works thereof are evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Go you up to this festival day, but I go not up to this festival day: because my time is not accomplished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">When he had said these things, he himself stayed in Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But after his brethren were gone up, then he also went up to the feast, not openly, but, as it were, in secret.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The Jews therefore sought him on the festival day, and said: Where is he?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And there was much murmuring among the multitude concerning him. For some said: He is a good man. And others said: No, but he seduceth the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Yet no man spoke openly of him, for fear of the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Now about the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And the Jews wondered, saying: How doth this man know letters, having never learned?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Jesus answered them, and said: My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If any man do the will of him; he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He that speaketh of himself, seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh the glory of him that sent him, he is true, and there is no injustice in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Did Moses not give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Why seek you to kill me? The multitude answered, and said: Thou hast a devil; who seeketh to kill thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Jesus answered, and said to them: One work I have done; and you all wonder:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Therefore, Moses gave you circumcision (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and on the sabbath day you circumcise a man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath day, that the law of Moses may not be broken; are you angry at me because I have healed the whole man on the sabbath day?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Judge not according to the appearance, but judge just judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Some therefore of Jerusalem said: Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And behold, he speaketh openly, and they say nothing to him. Have the rulers known for a truth, that this is the Christ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">But we know this man, whence he is: but when the Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching, and saying: You both know me, and you know whence I am: and I am not come of myself; but he that sent me, is true, whom you know not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">I know him, because I am from him, and he hath sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">They sought therefore to apprehend him: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">But of the people many believed in him, and said: When the Christ cometh, shall he do more miracles, than these which this man doth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">The Pharisees heard the people murmuring these things concerning him: and the rulers and Pharisees sent ministers to apprehend him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while I am with you: and then I go to him that sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">You shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither you cannot come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">The Jews therefore said among themselves: Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">What is this saying that he hath said: You shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, you cannot come?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And on the last, and great day of the festivity, Jesus stood and cried, saying: If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">He that believeth in me, as the scripture saith, Out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Now this he said of the Spirit which they should receive, who believed in him: for as yet the Spirit was not given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Of that multitude therefore, when they had heard these words of his, some said: This is the prophet indeed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Others said: This is the Christ. But some said: Doth the Christ come out of Galilee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">Doth not the scripture say: That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem the town where David was?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">So there arose a dissension among the people because of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And some of them would have apprehended him: but no man laid hands on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">The ministers therefore came to the chief priests and the Pharisees. And they said to them: Why have you not brought him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">The ministers answered: Never did man speak like this man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">The Pharisees therefore answered them: Are you also seduced?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">Hath any one of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">But this multitude, that knoweth not the law, are accursed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">Nicodemus said to them, (he that came to him by night, who was one of them:)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">Doth our law judge any man, unless it first hear him, and know what he doth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">They answered, and said to him: Art thou also a Galilean? Search the scriptures, and see, that out of Galilee a prophet riseth not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">And every man returned to his own house.</p>
