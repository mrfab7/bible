  <verse number="1">Then Zophar the Naamathite answered,</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Therefore do my thoughts give answer to me, even by reason of my haste that is in me.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I have heard the reproof which puts me to shame. The spirit of my understanding answers me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Don’t you know this from old time, since man was placed on earth,</verse>
  <verse number="5">that the triumphing of the wicked is short, the joy of the godless but for a moment?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Though his height mount up to the heavens, and his head reach to the clouds,</verse>
  <verse number="7">yet he shall perish forever like his own dung. Those who have seen him shall say, ‘Where is he?’</verse>
  <verse number="8">He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found. Yes, he shall be chased away like a vision of the night.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The eye which saw him shall see him no more, neither shall his place any more see him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">His children shall seek the favor of the poor. His hands shall give back his wealth.</verse>
  <verse number="11">His bones are full of his youth, but youth shall lie down with him in the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="12">“Though wickedness is sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue,</verse>
  <verse number="13">though he spare it, and will not let it go, but keep it still within his mouth;</verse>
  <verse number="14">yet his food in his bowels is turned. It is cobra venom within him.</verse>
  <verse number="15">He has swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again. God will cast them out of his belly.</verse>
  <verse number="16">He shall suck cobra venom. The viper’s tongue shall kill him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">He shall not look at the rivers, the flowing streams of honey and butter.</verse>
  <verse number="18">That for which he labored he shall restore, and shall not swallow it down. According to the substance that he has gotten, he shall not rejoice.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For he has oppressed and forsaken the poor. He has violently taken away a house, and he shall not build it up.</verse>
  <verse number="20">“Because he knew no quietness within him, he shall not save anything of that in which he delights.</verse>
  <verse number="21">There was nothing left that he didn’t devour, therefore his prosperity shall not endure.</verse>
  <verse number="22">In the fullness of his sufficiency, distress shall overtake him. The hand of everyone who is in misery shall come on him.</verse>
  <verse number="23">When he is about to fill his belly, God will cast the fierceness of his wrath on him. It will rain on him while he is eating.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He shall flee from the iron weapon. The bronze arrow shall strike him through.</verse>
  <verse number="25">He draws it forth, and it comes out of his body. Yes, the glittering point comes out of his liver. Terrors are on him.</verse>
  <verse number="26">All darkness is laid up for his treasures. An unfanned fire shall devour him. It shall consume that which is left in his tent.</verse>
  <verse number="27">The heavens shall reveal his iniquity. The earth shall rise up against him.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The increase of his house shall depart. They shall rush away in the day of his wrath.</verse>
  <verse number="29">This is the portion of a wicked man from God, the heritage appointed to him by God.”</verse>
