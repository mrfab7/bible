<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="11" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Be you followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Now I praise you, brothers, that you remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonors his head.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For the man is not of the woman: but the woman of the man.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray to God uncovered?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Does not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame to him?</verse>
  <verse number="15">But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Now in this that I declare to you I praise you not, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.</verse>
  <verse number="20">When you come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord’s supper.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For in eating every one takes before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</verse>
  <verse number="22">What? have you not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise you the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered to you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:</verse>
  <verse number="24">And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</verse>
  <verse number="25">After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do you, as oft as you drink it, in remembrance of me.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you do show the Lord’s death till he come.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Why whoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</verse>
  <verse number="31">For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Why, my brothers, when you come together to eat, tarry one for another.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that you come not together to condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.</verse>
