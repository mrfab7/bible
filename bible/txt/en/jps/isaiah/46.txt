1	Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth; Their idols are upon the beasts, and upon the cattle; The things that ye carried about are made a load, A burden to the weary beast.
2	They stoop, they bow down together, They could not deliver the burden; And themselves are gone into captivity.
3	Hearken unto Me, O house of Jacob, And all the remnant of the house of Israel, That are borne [by Me] from the birth, That are carried from the womb:
4	Even to old age I am the same, And even to hoar hairs will I carry you; I have made, and I will bear; Yea, I will carry, and will deliver.
5	To whom will ye liken Me, and make Me equal, And compare Me, that we may be like?
6	Ye that lavish gold out of the bag, And weigh silver in the balance; Ye that hire a goldsmith, that he make it a god, To fall down thereto, yea, to worship.
7	He is borne upon the shoulder, he is carried, And set in his place, and he standeth, From his place he doth not remove; Yea, though one cry unto him, he cannot answer, Nor save him out of his trouble.
8	Remember this, and stand fast; Bring it to mind, O ye transgressors.
9	Remember the former things of old: That I am God, and there is none else; I am God, and there is none like Me;
10	Declaring the end from the beginning, And from ancient times things that are not yet done; Saying: ‘My counsel shall stand, And all My pleasure will I do’;
11	Calling a bird of prey from the east, The man of My counsel from a far country; Yea, I have spoken, I will also bring it to pass, I have purposed, I will also do it.
12	Hearken unto Me, ye stout-hearted, That are far from righteousness:
13	I bring near My righteousness, it shall not be far off, And My salvation shall not tarry; And I will place salvation in Zion For Israel My glory.
