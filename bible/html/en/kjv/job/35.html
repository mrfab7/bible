<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Elihu spake moreover, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thinkest thou this to be right, [that] thou saidst, My righteousness [is] more than Godâ€™s?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? [and], What profit shall I have, [if I be cleansed] from my sin?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds [which] are higher than thou.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or [if] thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Thy wickedness [may hurt] a man as thou [art]; and thy righteousness [may profit] the son of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make [the oppressed] to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But none saith, Where [is] God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, [yet] judgment [is] before him; therefore trust thou in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">But now, because [it is] not [so], he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth [it] not in great extremity:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.</p>
