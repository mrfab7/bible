<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">If one venture a word unto thee, wilt thou be weary? But who can withhold himself from speaking?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Behold, thou hast instructed many, And thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thy words have upholden him that was falling, And thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But now it is come upon thee, and thou art weary; It toucheth thee, and thou art affrighted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Is not thy fear of God thy confidence, And thy hope the integrity of thy ways?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, And sow mischief, reap the same.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">By the breath of God they perish, And by the blast of His anger are they consumed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The lion roareth, and the fierce lion howleth—Yet the teeth of the young lions are broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Now a word was secretly brought to me, And mine ear received a whisper thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">In thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falleth on men,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Fear came upon me, and trembling, And all my bones were made to shake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Then a spirit passed before my face, That made the hair of my flesh to stand up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance thereof; A form was before mine eyes; I heard a still voice:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Shall mortal man be just before God? Shall a man be pure before his Maker?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Behold, He putteth no trust in His servants, And His angels He chargeth with folly;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Betwixt morning and evening they are shattered; They perish for ever without any regarding it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? They die, and that without wisdom.’</p>
