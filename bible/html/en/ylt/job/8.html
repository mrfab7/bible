<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith:—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Till when dost thou speak these things? And a strong wind—sayings of thy mouth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Doth God pervert judgment? And doth the Mighty One pervert justice?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If thy sons have sinned before Him, And He doth send them away, By the hand of their transgression,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If thou dost seek early unto God, And unto the Mighty makest supplication,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If pure and upright thou art, Surely now He waketh for thee, And hath completed The habitation of thy righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And thy beginning hath been small, And thy latter end is very great.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For, ask I pray thee of a former generation, And prepare to a search of their fathers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">(For of yesterday we are, and we know not, For a shadow are our days on earth.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Do they not shew thee—speak to thee, And from their heart bring forth words?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">‘Doth a rush wise without mire? A reed increase without water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">While it is in its budding—uncropped, Even before any herb it withereth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">So are the paths of all forgetting God, And the hope of the profane doth perish,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Whose confidence is loathsome, And the house of a spider his trust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He leaneth on his house—and it standeth not: He taketh hold on it—and it abideth not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Green he is before the sun, And over his garden his branch goeth out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">By a heap his roots are wrapped, A house of stones he looketh for.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If one doth destroy him from his place, Then it hath feigned concerning him, I have not seen thee!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Lo, this is the joy of his way, And from the dust others spring up.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Lo, God doth not reject the perfect, Nor taketh hold on the hand of evil doers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">While he filleth with laughter thy mouth, And thy lips with shouting,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Those hating thee do put on shame, And the tent of the wicked is not!</p>
