<chapter book="Job" number="24" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Why are times not laid up by the Almighty? and why do not they which know him see his days?</verse>
  <verse number="2">There are that remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow’s ox for a pledge.</verse>
  <verse number="4">They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Behold, as wild asses in the desert they go forth to their work, seeking diligently for meat; the wilderness yieldeth them food for their children.</verse>
  <verse number="6">They cut their provender in the field; and they glean the vintage of the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They lie all night naked without clothing, and have no covering in the cold.</verse>
  <verse number="8">They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.</verse>
  <verse number="9">There are that pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor:</verse>
  <verse number="10">So that they go about naked without clothing, and being an-hungred they carry the sheaves;</verse>
  <verse number="11">They make oil within the walls of these men; they tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.</verse>
  <verse number="12">From out of the populous city men groan, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God imputeth it not for folly.</verse>
  <verse number="13">These are of them that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The murderer riseth with the light, he killeth the poor and needy; and in the night he is as a thief.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and he disguiseth his face.</verse>
  <verse number="16">In the dark they dig through houses: they shut themselves up in the daytime; they know not the light.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For the morning is to all of them as the shadow of death; for they know the terrors of the shadow of death.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He is swift upon the face of the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he turneth not by the way of the vineyards.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth Sheol those which have sinned.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered: and unrighteousness shall be broken as a tree.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He devoureth the barren that beareth not; and doeth not good to the widow.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He draweth away the mighty also by his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.</verse>
  <verse number="23">God giveth them to be in security, and they rest thereon; and his eyes are upon their ways.</verse>
  <verse number="24">They are exalted; yet a little while, and they are gone; yea, they are brought low, they are taken out of the way as all other, and are cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And if it be not so now, who will prove me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?</verse>
