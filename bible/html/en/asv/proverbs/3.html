<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, forget not my law; But let thy heart keep my commandments:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For length of days, and years of life, And peace, will they add to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Let not kindness and truth forsake thee: Bind them about thy neck; Write them upon the tablet of thy heart:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">So shalt thou find favor and good understanding In the sight of God and man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Trust in Jehovah with all thy heart, And lean not upon thine own understanding:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">In all thy ways acknowledge him, And he will direct thy paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Be not wise in thine own eyes; Fear Jehovah, and depart from evil:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">It will be health to thy navel, And marrow to thy bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Honor Jehovah with thy substance, And with the first-fruits of all thine increase:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, And thy vats shall overflow with new wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My son, despise not the chastening of Jehovah; Neither be weary of his reproof:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For whom Jehovah loveth he reproveth; Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, And the man that getteth understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of silver, And the profit thereof than fine gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">She is more precious than rubies: And none of the things thou canst desire are to be compared unto her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Length of days is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: And happy is every one that retaineth her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding he established the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">By his knowledge the depths were broken up, And the skies drop down the dew.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">My son, let them not depart from thine eyes; Keep sound wisdom and discretion:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">So shall they be life unto thy soul, And grace to thy neck.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely, And thy foot shall not stumble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: Yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Be not afraid of sudden fear, Neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For Jehovah will be thy confidence, And will keep thy foot from being taken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, When it is in the power of thy hand to do it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Say not unto thy neighbor, Go, and come again, And to-morrow I will give; When thou hast it by thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Devise not evil against thy neighbor, Seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Strive not with a man without cause, If he have done thee no harm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Envy thou not the man of violence, And choose none of his ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For the perverse is an abomination to Jehovah; But his friendship is with the upright.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked; But he blesseth the habitation of the righteous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Surely he scoffeth at the scoffers; But he giveth grace unto the lowly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">The wise shall inherit glory; But shame shall be the promotion of fools.</p>
