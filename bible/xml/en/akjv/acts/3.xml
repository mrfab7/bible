  <verse number="1">Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;</verse>
  <verse number="3">Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And Peter, fastening his eyes on him with John, said, Look on us.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive something of them.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And all the people saw him walking and praising God:</verse>
  <verse number="10">And they knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly wondering.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And when Peter saw it, he answered to the people, You men of Israel, why marvel you at this? or why look you so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?</verse>
  <verse number="13">The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus; whom you delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted to you;</verse>
  <verse number="15">And killed the Prince of life, whom God has raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And his name through faith in his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know: yes, the faith which is by him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And now, brothers, I know that through ignorance you did it, as did also your rulers.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But those things, which God before had showed by the mouth of all his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he has so fulfilled.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Repent you therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached to you:</verse>
  <verse number="21">Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For Moses truly said to the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brothers, like to me; him shall you hear in all things whatever he shall say to you.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.</verse>
  <verse number="25">You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</verse>
  <verse number="26">To you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.</verse>
