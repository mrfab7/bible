<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and wilt hide my commandments with thee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">That thy ear may hearken to wisdom: Incline thy heart to know prudence:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For if thou shalt call for wisdom, and incline thy heart to prudence:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If thou shalt seek her as money, and shalt dig for her as for a treasure:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and shalt find the knowledge of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Because the Lord giveth wisdom: and out of his mouth cometh prudence and knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He will keep the salvation of the righteous, and protect them that walk in simplicity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Keeping the paths of justice, and guarding the ways of saints.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then shalt thou understand justice, and judgment, and equity, and every good path.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If wisdom shall enter into thy heart, and knowledge please thy soul:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Counsel shall keep thee, and prudence shall preserve thee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">That thou mayst be delivered from the evil way, and from the man that speaketh perverse things:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who leave the right way, and walk by dark ways:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Who are glad when they have done evil, and rejoice in most wicked things:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Whose ways are perverse, and their steps infamous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">That thou mayst be delivered from the strange women, and from the stranger, who softeneth her words:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And forsaketh the guide of her youth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And hath forgotten the covenant of her God: for her house inclineth unto death, and her paths to hell.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">None that go in unto her shall return again, neither shall they take hold of the paths of life,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">That thou mayst walk in a good way: and mayst keep the paths of the just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For they that are upright shall dwell in the earth, and the simple shall continue in it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But the wicked shall be destroyed from the earth: and they that do unjustly shall be taken away from it.</p>
