<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Whoso loveth knowledge loveth correction; But he that is brutish hateth reproof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A good man shall obtain favour of the LORD; But a man of wicked devices will He condemn.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A man shall not be established by wickedness; But the root of the righteous shall never be moved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband; But she that doeth shamefully is as rottenness in his bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The thoughts of the righteous are right; But the counsels of the wicked are deceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood; But the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The wicked are overthrown, and are not; But the house of the righteous shall stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">A man shall be commended according to his intelligence; But he that is of a distorted understanding shall be despised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Better is he that is lightly esteemed, and hath a servant, Than he that playeth the man of rank, and lacketh bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast; But the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He that tilleth his ground shall have plenty of bread; But he that followeth after vain things is void of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The wicked desireth the prey of evil men; But the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">In the transgression of the lips is a snare to the evil man; But the righteous cometh out of trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth, And the doings of a man’s hands shall be rendered unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The way of a fool is straight in his own eyes; But he that is wise hearkeneth unto counsel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A fool’s vexation is presently known; But a prudent man concealeth shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He that breatheth forth truth uttereth righteousness; But a false witness deceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword; But the tongue of the wise is health.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The lip of truth shall be established for ever; But a lying tongue is but for a moment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Deceit is in the heart of them that devise evil; But to the counsellors of peace is joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">There shall no mischief befall the righteous; But the wicked are filled with evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Lying lips are an abomination to the LORD; But they that deal truly are His delight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">A prudent man concealeth knowledge; But the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The hand of the diligent shall bear rule; But the slothful shall be under tribute.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Care in the heart of a man boweth it down; But a good word maketh it glad.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">The righteous is guided by his friend; But the way of the wicked leadeth them astray.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The slothful man shall not hunt his prey; But the precious substance of men is to be diligent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">In the way of righteousness is life, And in the pathway thereof there is no death.</p>
