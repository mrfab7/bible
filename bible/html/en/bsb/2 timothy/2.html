<div class="chapter" data-book="2 Timothy" data-chapter="2" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">You therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And the things that you have heard me say among many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be qualified to teach others as well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Join me in suffering, like a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">A soldier refrains from entangling himself in civilian affairs, in order to please the one who enlisted him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Likewise, a competitor does not receive the crown unless he competes according to the rules.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The hardworking farmer should be the first to partake of the crops.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Consider what I am saying, for the Lord will give you insight into all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David, as proclaimed by my gospel,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">for which I suffer to the extent of being chained like a criminal. But the word of God cannot be chained!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For this reason I endure all things for the sake of the elect, so that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">This is a trustworthy saying: If we died with Him, we will also live with Him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">if we endure, we will also reign with Him; if we deny Him, He will also deny us;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">if we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Remind the believers of these things, charging them before God to avoid quarreling over words, which succeeds only in leading the listeners to ruin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Make every effort to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman who accurately handles the word of truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But avoid irreverent, empty chatter, which will only lead to more ungodliness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">and the talk of such men will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">who have deviated from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already occurred, and they undermine the faith of some.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Nevertheless, God’s firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: “The Lord knows those who are His,” and, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord must turn away from iniquity.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A large house contains not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay. Some indeed are for honorable use, but others are for common use.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">So if anyone cleanses himself of what is unfit, he will be a vessel for honor: sanctified, useful to the Master, and prepared for every good work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Flee from youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, together with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But reject foolish and ignorant speculation, for you know that it breeds quarreling.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And a servant of the Lord must not be quarrelsome, but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, and forbearing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">He must gently reprove those who oppose him, in the hope that God may grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Then they will come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil, who has taken them captive to his will.</p>
