<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="7" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Let the husband render to the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife to the husband.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The wife has not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband has not power of his own body, but the wife.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Defraud you not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man has his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.</verse>
  <verse number="8">I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:</verse>
  <verse number="11">But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the woman which has an husband that believes not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God has called us to peace.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For what know you, O wife, whether you shall save your husband? or how know you, O man, whether you shall save your wife?</verse>
  <verse number="17">But as God has distributed to every man, as the Lord has called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Are you called being a servant? care not for it: but if you may be made free, use it rather.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord’s freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s servant.</verse>
  <verse number="23">You are bought with a price; be not you the servants of men.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Brothers, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</verse>
  <verse number="26">I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Are you bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But and if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.</verse>
  <verse number="29">But this I say, brothers, the time is short: it remains, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;</verse>
  <verse number="30">And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;</verse>
  <verse number="31">And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passes away.</verse>
  <verse number="32">But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:</verse>
  <verse number="33">But he that is married cares for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.</verse>
  <verse number="34">There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare on you, but for that which is comely, and that you may attend on the Lord without distraction.</verse>
  <verse number="36">But if any man think that he behaves himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sins not: let them marry.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Nevertheless he that stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well.</verse>
  <verse number="38">So then he that gives her in marriage does well; but he that gives her not in marriage does better.</verse>
  <verse number="39">The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="40">But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.</verse>
