  <verse number="1">O LORD, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things, even counsels of old, in faithfulness and truth.</verse>

  <verse number="3">Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For thou hast been a strong hold to the poor, a strong hold to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.</verse>
  <verse number="5">As the heat in a dry place shalt thou bring down the noise of strangers; as the heat by the shadow of a cloud, the song of the terrible ones shall be brought low.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering that is cast over all peoples, and the veil that is spread over all nations.</verse>

  <verse number="9">And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down in his place, even as straw is trodden down in the water of the dunghill.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst thereof, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he shall lay low his pride together with the craft of his hands.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls hath he brought down, laid low, and brought to the ground, even to the dust.</verse>
