<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="19" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But Job answered by saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How long will you afflict my soul and wear me down with words?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">So, ten times you confound me and are not ashamed to oppress me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Now, of course, if I have been ignorant, my ignorance will be with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But you have risen up against me, and you accuse me to my disgrace.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">At least now you should understand that God has not afflicted me with a balanced judgment, though he has encompassed me with his scourges.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, I will cry out, enduring violence, and no one will hear. I will announce loudly, but there is no one who may judge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He has hemmed in my path, and I cannot pass; he has added darkness to my difficult path.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He has plundered me of my glory, and he has stolen the crown from my head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He has destroyed me on every side, and I am lost, and, like an uprooted tree, he has taken away my hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">His fury has raged against me, and in this way he has treated me like his enemy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">His troops have gathered together, and they have made their way to me, and they have besieged my tabernacle all around.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He has put my brothers far from me, and my friends have withdrawn from me like strangers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">My kinsmen have forsaken me, and those who knew me, have forgotten me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The inhabitants of my house and my maidservants treat me just as if I were a stranger, and I have been like an sojourner in their eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I called my servant, and he did not respond; I pleaded with him with my own mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">My wife has shuddered at my breath, and I have begged the sons of my loins.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Even the foolish have looked down on me, and, when I withdrew from them, they spoke ill of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Those who were sometime my counselors, treat me like an abomination; and he whom I valued the most has turned against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Since my flesh has been consumed, my bone adheres to my skin, and only my lips have been left around my teeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Have mercy on me, have compassion on me, at least you my friends, because the hand of the Lord has touched me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Why do you pursue me just as God does, and satiate yourselves with my flesh?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Who will grant to me that my words may be written down? Who will grant to me that they may be inscribed in a book,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">with an iron pen and a plate of lead, or else be carved in stone?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For I know that my Redeemer lives, and on the last day I will rise out of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And I will be enveloped again with my skin, and in my flesh I will see my God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">It is he whom I myself will see, and he whom my eyes will behold, and no other. This, my hope, has taken rest in my bosom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Why then do you now say: “Let us pursue him, and let us find a basis to speak against him?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">So then, flee from the face of the sword, for the sword is the avenger of iniquities; but know this: there is to be a judgment.</p>
