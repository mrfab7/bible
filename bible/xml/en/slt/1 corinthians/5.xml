<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="5" translation="Smith's Literal Translation" translationID="slt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">In general is fornication heard among you, and such fornication which is not named in the nations, for any to have his father’s wife.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And ye were puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he having done this work might be taken away from the midst of you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For I truly, as being at a distance in body, and being present in spirit, have already, as being present, judged him having so worked this.</verse>
  <verse number="4">In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, ye, gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
  <verse number="5">To deliver such a one to Satan for the ruin of the flesh, that the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Your boasting not good. Know ye not that a little leaven may leaven the whole mixture?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Therefore cleanse out the old leaven, that ye may be a new mixture, as ye are unleavened. For also our pascha was sacrificed for us, Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="8">Therefore let us keep the festival, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of vice and wickedness; but with the unleavened of frankincense and truth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I wrote to you in the epistle not to mix together with fornicators.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or the rapacious, or idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And now I wrote to you not to mix together, if any called a brother is a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or intoxicated, or rapacious; not to eat with such.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For what to me also to judge them without? do ye yourselves judge them within.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And them without God judges. And take ye away evil from yourselves.</verse>
