<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Brothers, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Bear you one anotherâ€™s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For every man shall bear his own burden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teaches in all good things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For he that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all men, especially to them who are of the household of faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">You see how large a letter I have written to you with my own hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and on the Israel of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">From now on let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Brothers, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
