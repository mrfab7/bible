  <verse number="1">The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hear, heavens, and listen, earth; for Yahweh has spoken: “I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master’s crib; but Israel doesn’t know, my people don’t consider.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">Ah sinful nation, a people loaded with iniquity, a seed of evildoers, children who deal corruptly! They have forsaken Yahweh. They have despised the Holy One of Israel. They are estranged and backward.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Why should you be beaten more, that you revolt more and more? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</verse>
  <verse number="6">From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it: wounds, welts, and open sores. They haven’t been closed, neither bandaged, neither soothed with oil.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Your country is desolate. Your cities are burned with fire. Strangers devour your land in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The daughter of Zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard, like a hut in a field of melons, like a besieged city.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Unless Yahweh of Armies had left to us a very small remnant, we would have been as Sodom; we would have been like Gomorrah.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Hear the word of Yahweh, you rulers of Sodom! Listen to the law of our God, you people of Gomorrah!</verse>
  <verse number="11">“What are the multitude of your sacrifices to me?,” says Yahweh. “I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed animals. I don’t delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of male goats.</verse>
  <verse number="12">When you come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand, to trample my courts?</verse>
  <verse number="13">Bring no more vain offerings. Incense is an abomination to me; new moons, Sabbaths, and convocations: I can’t bear with evil assemblies.</verse>
  <verse number="14">My soul hates your New Moons and your appointed feasts. They are a burden to me. I am weary of bearing them.</verse>
  <verse number="15">When you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you. Yes, when you make many prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Wash yourselves, make yourself clean. Put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes. Cease to do evil.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Learn to do well. Seek justice. Relieve the oppressed. Judge the fatherless. Plead for the widow.”</verse>
  <verse number="18">“Come now, and let us reason together,” says Yahweh: “Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</verse>
  <verse number="19">If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;</verse>
  <verse number="20">but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.”</verse>
  <verse number="21">How the faithful city has become a prostitute! She was full of justice; righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Your princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves. Everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards. They don’t judge the fatherless, neither does the cause of the widow come to them.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, the Mighty One of Israel, says: “Ah, I will get relief from my adversaries, and avenge myself of my enemies;</verse>
  <verse number="25">and I will turn my hand on you, thoroughly purge away your dross, and will take away all your tin.</verse>
  <verse number="26">I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called ‘The city of righteousness, a faithful town.’</verse>
  <verse number="27">Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together, and those who forsake Yahweh shall be consumed.</verse>
  <verse number="29">For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For you shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden that has no water.</verse>
  <verse number="31">The strong will be like tinder, and his work like a spark. They will both burn together, and no one will quench them.”</verse>
