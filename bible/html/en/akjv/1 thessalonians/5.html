<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Thessalonians" data-chapter="5" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">But of the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that I write to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes on them, as travail on a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But you, brothers, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">You are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Why comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also you do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And we beseech you, brothers, to know them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And to esteem them very highly in love for their workâ€™s sake. And be at peace among yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Now we exhort you, brothers, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">See that none render evil for evil to any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Rejoice ever more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Pray without ceasing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Quench not the Spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Despise not prophesyings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Abstain from all appearance of evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Faithful is he that calls you, who also will do it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Brothers, pray for us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Greet all the brothers with an holy kiss.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">I charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</p>
