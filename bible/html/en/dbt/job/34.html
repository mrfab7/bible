<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover Elihu answered and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear my words, ye wise [men]; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the ear trieth words, as the palate tasteth food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Let us choose for ourselves what is right; let us know among ourselves what is good!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For Job hath said, I am righteous, and God hath taken away my judgment:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Should I lie against my right? My wound is incurable without transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">What man is like Job? he drinketh up scorning like water,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And goeth in company with workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For he hath said, It profiteth not a man if he delight himself in God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: Far be wickedness from God, and wrong from the Almighty!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For a manâ€™s work will he render to him, and cause every one to find according to [his] way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Yea, surely, God acteth not wickedly, and the Almighty perverteth not judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who hath entrusted to him the earth? and who hath disposed the whole world?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If he only thought of himself, [and] gathered unto him his spirit and his breath,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All flesh would expire together, and man would return to the dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If now [thou hast] understanding, hear this: give ear to the voice of my words!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Should he that hateth right indeed govern? and wilt thou condemn the All-just?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Shall one say to a king, Belial? to nobles, Wicked?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">[How then to him] that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich man more than the poor? for they are all the work of his hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In a moment they die, even at midnight the people are convulsed and pass away; and the strong are taken away without hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his steps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For he doth not long consider a man, to bring him before God in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He breaketh in pieces mighty men without inquiry, and setteth others in their stead;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Since he knoweth their actions; and he overthroweth [them] in the night, and they are crushed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Because they have turned back from him, and would consider none of his ways;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">When he giveth quietness, who then will disturb? and when he hideth [his] face, who shall behold him? and this towards a nation, or towards a man alike;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">That the ungodly man reign not, that the people be not ensnared.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For hath he said unto God, I bear [chastisement], I will not offend;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">What I see not, teach thou me; if I have done wrong, I will do so no more?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Shall he recompense according to thy mind? for thou hast refused [his judgment]; for thou so choosest, and not I; speak then what thou knowest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Men of understanding will say to me, and a wise man who heareth me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were not with intelligence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Would that Job may be tried unto the end, because of [his] answers after the manner of evil men!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth [his hands] among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</p>
