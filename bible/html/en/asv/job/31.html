<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="31" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I made a covenant with mine eyes; How then should I look upon a virgin?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For what is the portion from God above, And the heritage from the Almighty on high?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is it not calamity to the unrighteous, And disaster to the workers of iniquity?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Doth not he see my ways, And number all my steps?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If I have walked with falsehood, And my foot hath hasted to deceit</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">(Let me be weighed in an even balance, That God may know mine integrity);</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If my step hath turned out of the way, And my heart walked after mine eyes, And if any spot hath cleaved to my hands:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then let me sow, and let another eat; Yea, let the produce of my field be rooted out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">If my heart hath been enticed unto a woman, And I have laid wait at my neighbor’s door;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then let my wife grind unto another, And let others bow down upon her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For that were a heinous crime; Yea, it were an iniquity to be punished by the judges:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For it is a fire that consumeth unto Destruction, And would root out all mine increase.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I have despised the cause of my man-servant or of my maid-servant, When they contended with me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What then shall I do when God riseth up? And when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Did not he that made me in the womb make him? And did not one fashion us in the womb?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If I have withheld the poor from their desire, Or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Or have eaten my morsel alone, And the fatherless hath not eaten thereof</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">(Nay, from my youth he grew up with me as with a father, And her have I guided from my mother’s womb);</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, Or that the needy had no covering;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">If his loins have not blessed me, And if he hath not been warmed with the fleece of my sheep;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, Because I saw my help in the gate:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Then let my shoulder fall from the shoulder-blade, And mine arm be broken from the bone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For calamity from God is a terror to me, And by reason of his majesty I can do nothing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">If I have made gold my hope, And have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If I have rejoiced because my wealth was great, And because my hand had gotten much;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">If I have beheld the sun when it shined, Or the moon walking in brightness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And my heart hath been secretly enticed, And my mouth hath kissed my hand:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judges; For I should have denied the God that is above.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">If I have rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, Or lifted up myself when evil found him</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">(Yea, I have not suffered by mouth to sin By asking his life with a curse);</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">If the men of my tent have not said, Who can find one that hath not been filled with his meat?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">(The sojourner hath not lodged in the street; But I have opened my doors to the traveller);</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If like Adam I have covered my transgressions, By hiding mine iniquity in my bosom,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Because I feared the great multitude, And the contempt of families terrified me, So that I kept silence, and went not out of the door—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Oh that I had one to hear me! (Lo, here is my signature, let the Almighty answer me) And that I had the indictment which mine adversary hath written!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Surely I would carry it upon my shoulder; I would bind it unto me as a crown:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">I would declare unto him the number of my steps; As a prince would I go near unto him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">If my land crieth out against me, And the furrows thereof weep together;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, Or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Let thistles grow instead of wheat, And cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.</p>
