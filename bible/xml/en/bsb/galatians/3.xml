<chapter book="Galatians" number="3" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? Before your very eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed as crucified.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I would like to learn just one thing from you: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by hearing with faith?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Are you so foolish? After starting in the Spirit, are you now finishing in the flesh?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Have you suffered so much for nothing, if it really was for nothing?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Does God lavish His Spirit on you and work miracles among you because you practice the law, or because you hear and believe?</verse>
  <verse number="6">So also, “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”</verse>
  <verse number="7">Understand, then, that those who have faith are sons of Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The Scripture foresaw that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, and foretold the gospel to Abraham: “All nations will be blessed through you.”</verse>
  <verse number="9">So those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.</verse>
  <verse number="10">All who rely on works of the law are under a curse. For it is written: “Cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the Book of the Law.”</verse>
  <verse number="11">Now it is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because, “The righteous will live by faith.”</verse>
  <verse number="12">The law, however, is not based on faith; on the contrary, “The man who does these things will live by them.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. For it is written: “Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">He redeemed us in order that the blessing promised to Abraham would come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, so that by faith we might receive the promise of the Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Brothers, let me put this in human terms. Even a human covenant, once it is ratified, cannot be canceled or amended.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. The Scripture does not say, “and to seeds,” meaning many, but “and to your seed,” meaning One, who is Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="17">What I mean is this: The law that came 430 years later does not revoke the covenant previously established by God, so as to nullify the promise.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For if the inheritance depends on the law, then it no longer depends on a promise; but God freely granted it to Abraham through a promise.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Why then was the law given? It was added because of transgressions, until the arrival of the seed to whom the promise referred. It was administered through angels by a mediator.</verse>
  <verse number="20">A mediator is unnecessary, however, for only one party; but God is one.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Is the law, then, opposed to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come from the law.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But the Scripture pronounces all things confined by sin, so that by faith in Jesus Christ the promise might be given to those who believe.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Before this faith came, we were held in custody under the law, locked up until faith should be revealed.</verse>
  <verse number="24">So the law became our guardian to lead us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.</verse>
  <verse number="26">You are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="28">There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed and heirs according to the promise.</verse>
