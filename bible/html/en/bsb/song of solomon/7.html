<div class="chapter" data-book="Song of Solomon" data-chapter="7" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">How beautiful are your sandaled feet, O daughter of the prince! The curves of your thighs are like jewels, the handiwork of a master.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Your navel is a rounded goblet; it never lacks blended wine. Your waist is a mound of wheat encircled by the lilies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Your breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Your neck is like a tower made of ivory; your eyes are like the pools of Heshbon by the gate of Bath-rabbim; your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, facing toward Damascus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Your head crowns you like Mount Carmel, the hair of your head like purple threads; the king is captured in your tresses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">How fair and pleasant you are, O love, with your delights!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Your stature is like a palm tree; your breasts are clusters of fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I said, “I will climb the palm tree; I will take hold of its fruit.” May your breasts be like clusters of the vine, the fragrance of your breath like apples,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and your mouth like the finest wine. May it flow smoothly to my beloved, gliding gently over lips and teeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I belong to my beloved, and his desire is for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Come, my beloved, let us go to the countryside; let us spend the night among the wildflowers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Let us go early to the vineyards to see if the vine has budded, if the blossom has opened, if the pomegranates are in bloom—there I will give you my love.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The mandrakes send forth a fragrance, and at our door is every delicacy, new as well as old, that I have treasured up for you, my beloved.</p>
