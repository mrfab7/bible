<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover, the LORD answered Job, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yes, twice; but I will proceed no further.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like his?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Deck thyself now with majesty and excellence; and array thyself with glory and beauty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in secret.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then will I also confess to thee that thy own right hand can save thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his male organs are wrapped together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook encompass him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.</p>
