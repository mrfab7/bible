1	And Job will add to take up his parable, and say,
2	God lives, he removed my judgment; and the Almighty embittered my soul;
3	For all the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God in my nose;
4	If my lips shall speak iniquity, and my tongue if it shall murmur deceit.
5	Far be it to me if I shall justify you: till I expire I will not remove my integrity from me.
6	My justice I held fast, and I will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach from my days.
7	Mine enemy shall be as the unjust one, and he rising up against me, as the evil one.
8	For what the hope of the profane one if he shall plunder? for God shall draw out his soul.
9	Will God hear his cry when straits shall come upon him?
10	If he will delight himself upon the Almighty? will he call upon God in all time?
11	I will teach you by the hand of God: what is with the Almighty I will not hide.
12	Behold, all ye yourselves saw; and wherefore this, will ye breathe out vanity?
13	This the portion of an unjust man with God, and the inheritance of the terrible they shall take from the Almighty.
14	If his sons shall be multiplied, for then the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
15	His surviving one shall be buried in death, and his widows shall not weep.
16	If he shall heap up silver as the dust, and prepare clothing as clay;
17	He shall prepare, and the just shall put on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.
18	He built his house as the moth, and as a booth he watching made.
19	The rich one shall lie down, and he shall not be gathered: he opened his eyes, and he is not.
20	Terrors shall hedge him about as waters, the night a tempest stole him away.
21	The east wind shall lift him up, and he shall go: and it shall sweep him away in storm from his place.
22	For he shall cast upon him and not spare: fleeing, he will flee from his hand.
23	It shall be clapped upon him with their hands, and it shall be hissed upon him from his place.
