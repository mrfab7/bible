<chapter book="Proverbs" number="1" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:</verse>
  <verse number="2">To know wisdom and instruction; To discern the words of understanding;</verse>
  <verse number="3">To receive instruction in wise dealing, In righteousness and justice and equity;</verse>
  <verse number="4">To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion:</verse>
  <verse number="5">That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; And that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels:</verse>
  <verse number="6">To understand a proverb, and a figure, The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge; But the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.</verse>
  <verse number="8">My son, hear the instruction of thy father, And forsake not the law of thy mother:</verse>
  <verse number="9">For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, And chains about thy neck.</verse>
  <verse number="10">My son, if sinners entice thee, Consent thou not.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If they say, Come with us, Let us lay wait for blood; Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause;</verse>
  <verse number="12">Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, And whole, as those that go down into the pit;</verse>
  <verse number="13">We shall find all precious substance; We shall fill our houses with spoil;</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thou shalt cast thy lot among us; We will all have one purse:</verse>
  <verse number="15">My son, walk not thou in the way with them; Refrain thy foot from their path:</verse>
  <verse number="16">For their feet run to evil, And they make haste to shed blood.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For in vain is the net spread In the sight of any bird:</verse>
  <verse number="18">And these lay wait for their own blood; They lurk privily for their own lives.</verse>
  <verse number="19">So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; It taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Wisdom crieth aloud in the street; She uttereth her voice in the broad places;</verse>
  <verse number="21">She crieth in the chief place of concourse; At the entrance of the gates, In the city, she uttereth her words:</verse>
  <verse number="22">How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? And scoffers delight them in scoffing, And fools hate knowledge?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Turn you at my reproof: Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you; I will make known my words unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Because I have called, and ye have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man hath regarded;</verse>
  <verse number="25">But ye have set at nought all my counsel, And would none of my reproof:</verse>
  <verse number="26">I also will laugh in the day of your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</verse>
  <verse number="27">When your fear cometh as a storm, And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; When distress and anguish come upon you.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me:</verse>
  <verse number="29">For that they hated knowledge, And did not choose the fear of Jehovah:</verse>
  <verse number="30">They would none of my counsel; They despised all my reproof.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled with their own devices.</verse>
  <verse number="32">For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them, And the careless ease of fools shall destroy them.</verse>
  <verse number="33">But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, And shall be quiet without fear of evil.</verse>
