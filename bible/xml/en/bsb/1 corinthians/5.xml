<chapter book="1 Corinthians" number="5" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is intolerable even among pagans: A man has his father’s wife.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And you are proud! Shouldn’t you rather have been stricken with grief and have removed from your fellowship the man who did this?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Although I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit, and I have already pronounced judgment on the one who did this, just as if I were present.</verse>
  <verse number="4">When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus and I am with you in spirit, along with the power of the Lord Jesus,</verse>
  <verse number="5">hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved on the Day of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven works through the whole batch of dough?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Get rid of the old leaven, that you may be a new unleavened batch, as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Therefore let us keep the feast, not with the old bread, leavened with malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and of truth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">I wrote you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people.</verse>
  <verse number="10">I was not including the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But now I am writing you not to associate with anyone who claims to be a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or a verbal abuser, a drunkard or a swindler. With such a man do not even eat.</verse>
  <verse number="12">What business of mine is it to judge those outside the church? Are you not to judge those inside?</verse>
  <verse number="13">God will judge those outside. “Expel the wicked man from among you.”</verse>
