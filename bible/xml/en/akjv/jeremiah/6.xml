<chapter book="Jeremiah" number="6" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">O you children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the middle of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil appears out of the north, and great destruction.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in his place.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Prepare you war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe to us! for the day goes away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For thus has the LORD of hosts said, Hew you down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the middle of her.</verse>
  <verse number="7">As a fountain casts out her waters, so she casts out her wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually is grief and wounds.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Be you instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from you; lest I make you desolate, a land not inhabited.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Thus said the LORD of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back your hand as a grape gatherer into the baskets.</verse>
  <verse number="10">To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot listen: behold, the word of the LORD is to them a reproach; they have no delight in it.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out on the children abroad, and on the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And their houses shall be turned to others, with their fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand on the inhabitants of the land, said the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For from the least of them even to the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even to the priest every one deals falsely.</verse>
  <verse number="14">They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? no, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, said the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Thus said the LORD, Stand you in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and you shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Listen to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not listen.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Therefore hear, you nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil on this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not listened to my words, nor to my law, but rejected it.</verse>
  <verse number="20">To what purpose comes there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet to me.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Therefore thus said the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumbling blocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall on them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Thus said the LORD, Behold, a people comes from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="23">They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roars like the sea; and they ride on horses, set in array as men for war against you, O daughter of Zion.</verse>
  <verse number="24">We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish has taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side.</verse>
  <verse number="26">O daughter of my people, gird you with sackcloth, and wallow yourself in ashes: make you mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come on us.</verse>
  <verse number="27">I have set you for a tower and a fortress among my people, that you may know and try their way.</verse>
  <verse number="28">They are all grievous rebels, walking with slanders: they are brass and iron; they are all corrupters.</verse>
  <verse number="29">The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melts in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the LORD has rejected them.</verse>
