<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah will say to Moses, Go to Pharaoh: for I made his heart heavy, and the heart of his servants; for sake of my setting these my signs within him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And that thou shalt recount in the ears of thy son, and of thy son’s son, what I performed in Egypt, and my signs which I set up among them; and ye knew that I am Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Moses will come, and Aaron, to Pharaoh, and they will say to him, Thus said Jehovah the God of the Hebrews, Until long didst thou refuse to humble thyself from before me. Send forth my people and they shall serve me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For if thou refusest to send forth my people, behold me bringing to-morrow the locust into thy bounds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And it covered the eye of the earth, and he shall not be able to see the earth: and it shall eat the remainder of that escaping, being left to you from the hail; and it shall eat every tree springing up to you out of the field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And they filled thy houses and all the houses of thy servants, and the houses of all Egypt; which thy fathers saw not, and thy fathers’ fathers, from the day they were upon the earth, even till this day. And he will turn away and go forth from Pharaoh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And Pharaoh’s servants will say to him, How long will this, be to us for a snare? Send forth the men, and they shall serve Jehovah their God, before thou shalt know that Egypt is destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he will turn back Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh, and he will say to them, Go, serve Jehovah your God: who and who are they going.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Moses will say, With our youths and with our old men will we go; with our sons and with our daughters, with our sheep and with our oxen will we go: for a festival of Jehovah is to us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he will say to them, So will Jehovah be with you, as I will send you forth, and your little ones: see ye, for evil is manifest before you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Not so: go now, ye men, and serve Jehovah; for this ye yourselves were seeking. And he will drive them out from before Pharaoh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Jehovah will say to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand upon the land of Egypt, with the locust, and it will come up upon the land of Egypt; and it shall eat every green herb of the land, all which the hail left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Moses will stretch forth his rod upon the land of Egypt, and Jehovah drove an east wind upon the earth, all that day and all the night: it was morning, and the east wind raised up the locust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And the locust will come up upon all the land of Egypt, and it will rest in all the bounds of Egypt exceeding many: before it was there no locust thus like it, and after it, it shall not be thus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And it will cover the eye of all the earth, and the land will be dark; and it will eat every green herb of the land, and all the fruit of the tree which the hail left: and not a green thing was left in the tree, and in the green herb of the field, in all the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Pharaoh will hasten to call for Moses and for Aaron; and he will say, I sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And at this time take away now my sin, only this time, and pray ye to Jehovah your God, and he will remove from me only this death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And he will go forth from Pharaoh, and will pray to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Jehovah will turn a wind of the sea, exceedingly strong, and he will take away the locust and will drive it into the sea of sedge: not one locust remained in all the bounds of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Jehovah will bind fast the heart of Pharaoh, and he sent not forth the sons of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Jehovah will say to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand towards the heavens, and darkness shall be upon the land of Egypt, and the darkness shall be felt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Moses will stretch forth his hand toward the heavens, and there shall be thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">They saw not a man his brother, and they rose not up each from his lower part, three days: and to all the sons of Israel there was light in their dwellings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Pharaoh will call to Moses, and will say, Go ye, serve Jehovah: only your sheep and your oxen shall be left; also your little ones shall go with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Moses will say, Thou also shalt give into our hand sacrifices and burnt-offerings, and we sacrificed to Jehovah our God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And also our cattle shall go with us; a hoof shall not be left; for from us we shall take to serve Jehovah our God; and we shall not know what we shall serve Jehovah till we come there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And Jehovah will bind fast the heart of Pharaoh, and he not being willing to send them forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And Pharaoh will say to him, Go from me, watch to thyself; thou shalt not add to see my face, for in the day of thy seeing my face thou shalt die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Moses will say, Thou spakest well: I will no more add to see thy face.</p>
