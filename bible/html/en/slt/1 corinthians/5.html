<p class="verse" data-verse="1">In general is fornication heard among you, and such fornication which is not named in the nations, for any to have his fatherâ€™s wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And ye were puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he having done this work might be taken away from the midst of you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I truly, as being at a distance in body, and being present in spirit, have already, as being present, judged him having so worked this.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, ye, gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">To deliver such a one to Satan for the ruin of the flesh, that the spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Your boasting not good. Know ye not that a little leaven may leaven the whole mixture?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Therefore cleanse out the old leaven, that ye may be a new mixture, as ye are unleavened. For also our pascha was sacrificed for us, Christ:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Therefore let us keep the festival, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of vice and wickedness; but with the unleavened of frankincense and truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I wrote to you in the epistle not to mix together with fornicators.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or the rapacious, or idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And now I wrote to you not to mix together, if any called a brother is a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or intoxicated, or rapacious; not to eat with such.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For what to me also to judge them without? do ye yourselves judge them within.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And them without God judges. And take ye away evil from yourselves.</p>
