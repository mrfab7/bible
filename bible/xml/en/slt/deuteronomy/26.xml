  <verse number="18">And Jehovah said thee this day to be to him for a people of property, as he spake to thee, and to watch all his commands,</verse>
  <verse number="19">And to give thee high above all the nations which he made for a beginning and for a name, and for an ornament, and for thy being a holy people to Jehovah thy God, as he spake.</verse>
