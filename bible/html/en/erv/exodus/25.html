<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats’ hair;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and rams’ skins dyed red, and sealskins, and acacia wood;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil, and for the sweet incense;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">onyx stones, and stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And thou shalt put the mercy-seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy-seat, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And thou shalt make a table of acacia wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made, even its base, and its shaft; its cups, its knops, and its flowers, shall be of one piece with it:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">and there shall be six branches going out of the sides thereof; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side thereof:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">three cups made like almond-blossoms in one branch, a knop and a flower; and three cups made like almond-blossoms in the other branch, a knop and a flower: so for the six branches going out of the candlestick:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">and in the candlestick four cups made like almond-blossoms, the knops thereof, and the flowers thereof:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, and a knop under two branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going out of the candlestick.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Their knops and their branches shall be of one piece with it: the whole of it one beaten work of pure gold.</p>
