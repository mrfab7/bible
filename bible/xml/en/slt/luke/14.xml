  <verse number="1">And it was in his coining into the house of a certain of the Pharisees in the sabbath to eat bread, and they were observing him narrowly.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And, behold, a certain dropsical man was before him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And Jesus having answered, said to those skilled in the law and the Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to cure in the sabbath?</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they were silent. And having taken, he healed, and loosed him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And having answered, he said to them, Whose ass or ox of yours shall fall into a well, and will he not quickly pull it out on the sabbath day?</verse>
  <verse number="6">And they were not able to answer him in turn to these things.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And he spake a parable to the called, fixing his attention how they chose out the first places at table; saying to them,</verse>
  <verse number="8">When thou art called to the nuptials, thou shouldest not recline in the first place at table; lest a more honourable than thou be called by him:</verse>
  <verse number="9">And he having called thee and him, having come, shall say to thee, Give place to this; and then thou shalt begin with shame to take possession of the last place.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But when thou art called, having gone, recline in the last place; that when he having called thee come, might say to thee, Friend, mount up higher; then shall honour be to thee before them reclining with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For whoever exalts himself shall be humbled; and he humbling himself shall be exalted.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he also said to him having called him, When thou makest a breakfast or supper, call not thy friends, nor thy rich neighbors, nor thy brethren; lest they call thee in return, and a giving back be to thee.</verse>
  <verse number="13">But when thou makest an entertainment, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind:</verse>
  <verse number="14">And happy shalt thou be; for they have not to give back to thee: for it shall be given back to thee at the rising up of the just.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And a certain of them having reclined together, having heard these things, said to him, Happy he who shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he said to him, A certain man made a great supper and called many;</verse>
  <verse number="17">And he sent his servant at the hour of the supper to say to the called, Come; for all things are already prepared.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And from one they all began to conciliate. The first said to him, I bought a field, and have necessity to go and see it: I ask thee, have me pardoned.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I ask thee, have me pardoned.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And another said, I have married wife, and therefore I cannot come.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And approaching, that servant announced to his lord these things. Then the master of the house, angry, said to his servant, Go forth quickly into the streets and quarters of the city, and bring in hither the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the servant said, Lord, it has been done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is place.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the ways and hedges, and compel to come in, that my house may be filled up.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For I say to you, That none of those men called shall taste of my supper.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And great crowds went with him, and having turned he said to them.</verse>
  <verse number="26">If any come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, and yet also his own life, he cannot be my disciple.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And whoever lifts not his cross, and comes after me, cannot be my disciple.</verse>
  <verse number="28">For which of you, wishing to build a tower, not first, having sat down, calculates the expense, if he have things for completion?</verse>
  <verse number="29">That lest, having set the foundation, and not able to finish, all seeing begin to mock him,</verse>
  <verse number="30">Saying, That this man began to build, and was not able to finish.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Or what king, going to fight with another king in war, not, having sat down first, consults, if he be able with ten thousand to meet him coming with twenty thousand against him?</verse>
  <verse number="32">And if he, yet being far off, having sent an embassy, asks things for peace.</verse>
  <verse number="33">So then, every one of you, who renounces not all of his possessions, cannot be my disciple.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Salt good: but if salt be rendered insipid, with what shall it be fitted?</verse>
  <verse number="35">Neither for the land, nor is it fitted for the dunghill; they cast it without. He having ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
