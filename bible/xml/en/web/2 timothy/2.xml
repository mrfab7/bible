<chapter book="2 Timothy" number="2" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">You therefore, my child, be strengthened in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="2">The things which you have heard from me among many witnesses, commit the same to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.</verse>
  <verse number="3">You therefore must endure hardship, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="4">No soldier on duty entangles himself in the affairs of life, that he may please him who enrolled him as a soldier.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Also, if anyone competes in athletics, he isn’t crowned unless he has competed by the rules.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The farmers who labor must be the first to get a share of the crops.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Consider what I say, and may the Lord give you understanding in all things.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my Good News,</verse>
  <verse number="9">in which I suffer hardship to the point of chains as a criminal. But God’s word isn’t chained.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore I endure all things for the chosen ones’ sake, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</verse>
  <verse number="11">This saying is faithful: “For if we died with him, we will also live with him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he also will deny us.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If we are faithless, he remains faithful. He can’t deny himself.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">Remind them of these things, charging them in the sight of the Lord, that they don’t argue about words, to no profit, to the subverting of those who hear.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Give diligence to present yourself approved by God, a workman who doesn’t need to be ashamed, properly handling the Word of Truth.</verse>
  <verse number="16">But shun empty chatter, for it will go further in ungodliness,</verse>
  <verse number="17">and those words will consume like gangrene, of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;</verse>
  <verse number="18">men who have erred concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past, and overthrowing the faith of some.</verse>
  <verse number="19">However God’s firm foundation stands, having this seal, “The Lord knows those who are his,” and, “Let every one who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness.”</verse>
  <verse number="20">Now in a large house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay. Some are for honor, and some for dishonor.</verse>
  <verse number="21">If anyone therefore purges himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, and suitable for the master’s use, prepared for every good work.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Flee from youthful lusts; but pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But refuse foolish and ignorant questionings, knowing that they generate strife.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The Lord’s servant must not quarrel, but be gentle towards all, able to teach, patient,</verse>
  <verse number="25">in gentleness correcting those who oppose him: perhaps God may give them repentance leading to a full knowledge of the truth,</verse>
  <verse number="26">and they may recover themselves out of the devil’s snare, having been taken captive by him to his will.</verse>
