<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The Proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father; but a foolish son is the grief of his mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Treasures of wickedness profit nothing; but righteousness delivereth from death.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="4">He cometh to want that dealeth with a slack hand; but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He that gathereth in summer is a wise son; he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Blessings are upon the head of a righteous [man]; but the mouth of the wicked covereth violence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The memory of the righteous [man] shall be blessed; but the name of the wicked shall rot.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The wise in heart receiveth commandments; but a prating fool shall fall.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Hatred stirreth up strifes; but love covereth all transgressions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">In the lips of an intelligent [man] wisdom is found; but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The wise lay up knowledge; but the mouth of the fool is near destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The rich manâ€™s wealth is his strong city; the destruction of the poor is their poverty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The labour of a righteous [man] [tendeth] to life; the revenue of a wicked [man], to sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Keeping instruction is the path to life; but he that forsaketh reproof goeth astray.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He that covereth hatred hath lying lips, and he that sendeth forth a slander is a fool.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The tongue of the righteous [man] is [as] choice silver; the heart of the wicked is little worth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The lips of a righteous [man] feed many; but fools die for want of understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The blessing of Jehovah, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow to it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">It is as sport to a foolish [man] to do wickedness; but a man of understanding hath wisdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">The fear of a wicked [man], it shall come upon him; but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">As a whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no [more]; but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">The fear of Jehovah prolongeth days; but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The hope of the righteous is joy; but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.</p>
