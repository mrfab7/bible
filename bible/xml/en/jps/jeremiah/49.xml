  <verse number="1">Of the children of Ammon. Thus saith the LORD: Hath Israel no sons? Hath he no heir? Why then doth Malcam take possession of Gad, And his people dwell in the cities thereof?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, That I will cause an alarm of war to be heard Against Rabbah of the children of Ammon; And it shall become a desolate mound, And her daughters shall be burned with fire; Then shall Israel dispossess them that did dispossess him, Saith the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Wail, O Heshbon, for Ai is undone; Cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; Lament, and run to and fro among the folds; For Malcam shall go into captivity, His priests and his princes together.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, Thy flowing valley, O backsliding daughter? That didst trust in thy treasures: ‘Who shall come unto me?’</verse>
  <verse number="5">Behold, I will bring a terror upon thee, Saith the Lord GOD of hosts, From all that are round about thee; And ye shall be driven out every man right forth, And there shall be none to gather up him that wandereth.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children of Ammon, Saith the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Of Edom. Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Is wisdom no more in Teman? Is counsel perished from the prudent? Is their wisdom vanished?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; For I do bring the calamity of Esau upon him, The time that I shall punish him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">If grape-gatherers came to thee, Would they not leave some gleaning grapes? If thieves by night, Would they not destroy till they had enough?</verse>
  <verse number="10">But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places, And he shall not be able to hide himself; His seed is spoiled, and his brethren, And his neighbours, and he is not.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Leave thy fatherless children, I will rear them, And let thy widows trust in Me.</verse>
  <verse number="12">For thus saith the LORD: Behold, they to whom it pertained not to drink of the cup shall assuredly drink; and art thou he that shall altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For I have sworn by Myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I have heard a message from the LORD, And an ambassador is sent among the nations: ‘Gather yourselves together, and come against her, And rise up to the battle.’</verse>
  <verse number="15">For, behold, I make thee small among the nations, And despised among men.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, Even the pride of thy heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, That holdest the height of the hill; Though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Edom shall become an astonishment; Every one that passeth by it Shall be astonished and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="18">As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah And the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD, No man shall abide there, Neither shall any son of man dwell therein.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Behold, he shall come up like a lion From the thickets of the Jordan Against the strong habitation; For I will suddenly make him run away from it, And whoso is chosen, him will I appoint over it; For who is like Me? and who will appoint Me a time? And who is that shepherd that will stand before Me?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, That He hath taken against Edom; And His purposes, that He hath purposed against the inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall drag them away, Surely their habitation shall be appalled at them.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The earth quaketh at the noise of their fall; There is a cry, the noise whereof is heard in the Red Sea.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Behold, he shall come up and swoop down as the vulture, And spread out his wings against Bozrah; And the heart of the mighty men of Edom at that day Shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Of Damascus. Hamath is ashamed, and Arpad; For they have heard evil tidings, they are melted away; There is trouble in the sea; It cannot be quiet.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Damascus is waxed feeble, she turneth herself to flee, And trembling hath seized on her; Anguish and pangs have taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail.</verse>
  <verse number="25">How is the city of praise left unrepaired, The city of my joy?’</verse>
  <verse number="26">Therefore her young men shall fall in her broad places, And all the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day, Saith the LORD of hosts.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, And it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote. Thus saith the LORD: Arise ye, go up against Kedar, And spoil the children of the east.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Their tents and their flocks shall they take, They shall carry away for themselves their curtains, And all their vessels, and their camels; And they shall proclaim against them a terror on every side.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Flee ye, flit far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, saith the LORD; For Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, And hath conceived a purpose against you.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Arise, get you up against a nation that is at ease, That dwelleth without care, saith the LORD; That have neither gates nor bars, That dwell alone.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And their camels shall be a booty, And the multitude of their cattle a spoil; And I will scatter unto all winds them that have the corners polled; And I will bring their calamity from every side of them, saith the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And Hazor shall be a dwelling-place of jackals, A desolation for ever; no man shall abide there, Neither shall any son of man dwell therein.</verse>
  <verse number="34">The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="35">Thus saith the LORD of hosts: Behold, I will break the bow of Elam The chief of their might.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And I will bring against Elam the four winds From the four quarters of heaven, And will scatter them toward all those winds; And there shall be no nation whither the dispersed of Elam shall not come.</verse>
  <verse number="37">And I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, And before them that seek their life; And I will bring evil upon them, Even My fierce anger, saith the LORD; And I will send the sword after them, Till I have consumed them;</verse>
  <verse number="38">And I will set My throne in Elam, And will destroy from thence king and princes, saith the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="39">But it shall come to pass in the end of days, That I will bring back the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.</verse>
