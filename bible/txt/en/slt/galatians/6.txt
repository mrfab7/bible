1	Brethren, if a man be taken in any fault, ye the spiritual, restore such a one in the spirit of meekness; observing thyself narrowly, lest thou also be tempted.
2	Bear one anotherâ€™s burdens, and so fill up the law of Christ:
3	For if any think to be something, being nothing, he deceives himself.
4	And let each try his own work, and then in himself alone will he have boasting, and not in another.
5	For each shall bear his own load.
6	Let him being taught the word participate with him teaching in all good things.
7	Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man should sow, that also shall he reap.
8	For he sowing to his flesh of the flesh shall reap corruption; but he sowing to the Spirit, of the Spirit shall reap eternal life.
9	And doing good let us not despond: for in proper time we shall reap, not being enervated.
10	Wherefore then as we have time, let us work good to all, and chiefly to them of the household of faith.
11	See ye how large letters I wrote to you with mine own hand.
12	As many as: wish to have an agreeable demeanor in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only lest they should be driven out for the cross of Christ.
13	For neither they being circumcised themselves observe the law; but they wish you to be circumcised, that they might boast in your flesh.
14	And it may not be to me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.
15	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision has any power, nor uncircumcision but a new creation.
16	And as many as walk by this model, place upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
17	For the rest let none cause me fatigues: for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus Christ in my body.
18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with your spirit, brethren. Amen.
