  <verse number="1">When Jesus had finished saying all these things, He told His disciples,</verse>
  <verse number="2">“You know that the Passover is two days away, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">At that time the chief priests and elders of the people assembled in the courtyard of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas,</verse>
  <verse number="4">and they conspired to arrest Jesus covertly and kill Him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">“But not during the feast,” they said, “or there may be a riot among the people.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">While Jesus was in Bethany in the home of Simon the Leper,</verse>
  <verse number="7">a woman came to Him with an alabaster jar of expensive perfume, which she poured on His head as He reclined at the table.</verse>
  <verse number="8">When the disciples saw this, they were indignant and asked, “Why this waste?</verse>
  <verse number="9">This perfume could have been sold at a high price, and the money given to the poor.”</verse>
  <verse number="10">Aware of this, Jesus asked, “Why are you bothering this woman? She has done a beautiful deed to Me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The poor you will always have with you, but you will not always have Me.</verse>
  <verse number="12">By pouring this perfume on Me, she has prepared My body for burial.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Truly I tell you, wherever this gospel is preached in all the world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">Then one of the Twelve, the one called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests</verse>
  <verse number="15">and asked, “What are you willing to give me if I hand Him over to you?” And they set out for him thirty pieces of silver.</verse>
  <verse number="16">So from then on Judas looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="17">On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Where do You want us to prepare for You to eat the Passover?”</verse>
  <verse number="18">He answered, “Go into the city to a certain man and tell him that the Teacher says, ‘My time is near. I will keep the Passover with My disciples at your house.’”</verse>
  <verse number="19">So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover.</verse>
  <verse number="20">When evening came, Jesus was reclining with the twelve disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And while they were eating, He said to them, “Truly I tell you, one of you will betray Me.”</verse>
  <verse number="22">They were deeply grieved and began to ask Him one after another, “Surely not I, Lord?”</verse>
  <verse number="23">Jesus answered, “The one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with Me will betray Me.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The Son of Man will go just as it is written about Him, but woe to that man by whom He is betrayed. It would be better for him if he had not been born.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then Judas, who would betray Him, said, “Surely not I, Rabbi?” Jesus answered, “You have said it yourself.”</verse>
  <verse number="26">While they were eating, Jesus took bread, spoke a blessing and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, saying, “Take and eat; this is My body.”</verse>
  <verse number="27">Then He took the cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you.</verse>
  <verse number="28">This is My blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
  <verse number="29">I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it anew with you in My Father’s kingdom.”</verse>
  <verse number="30">And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Then Jesus said to them, “This very night you will all fall away on account of Me. For it is written: ‘I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’</verse>
  <verse number="32">But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”</verse>
  <verse number="33">Peter said to Him, “Even if all fall away on account of You, I never will.”</verse>
  <verse number="34">“Truly I tell you,” Jesus declared, “this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.”</verse>
  <verse number="35">Peter replied, “Even if I have to die with You, I will never deny You.” And all the other disciples said the same thing.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Then Jesus went with His disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and He told them, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”</verse>
  <verse number="37">He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed.</verse>
  <verse number="38">Then He said to them, “My soul is consumed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with Me.”</verse>
  <verse number="39">Going a little farther, He fell facedown and prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me. Yet not as I will, but as You will.”</verse>
  <verse number="40">Then Jesus returned to the disciples and found them sleeping. “Were you not able to keep watch with Me for one hour?” He asked Peter.</verse>
  <verse number="41">“Watch and pray so that you will not enter into temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak.”</verse>
  <verse number="42">A second time He went away and prayed, “My Father, if this cup cannot pass unless I drink it, may Your will be done.”</verse>
  <verse number="43">And again Jesus returned and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
  <verse number="44">So He left them and went away once more and prayed a third time, saying the same thing.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Then He returned to the disciples and said, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
  <verse number="46">Rise, let us go! See, My betrayer is approaching!”</verse>
  <verse number="47">While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived, accompanied by a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
  <verse number="48">Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: “The One I kiss is the man; arrest Him.”</verse>
  <verse number="49">Going directly to Jesus, he said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed Him.</verse>
  <verse number="50">“Friend,” Jesus replied, “do what you came for.” Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus, and arrested Him.</verse>
  <verse number="51">At this, one of Jesus’ companions drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.</verse>
  <verse number="52">“Put your sword back in its place,” Jesus said to him. “For all who draw the sword will die by the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="53">Are you not aware that I can call on My Father, and He will at once put at My disposal more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
  <verse number="54">But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen this way?”</verse>
  <verse number="55">At that time Jesus said to the crowd, “Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest Me as you would an outlaw? Every day I sat teaching in the temple courts, and you did not arrest Me.</verse>
  <verse number="56">But this has all happened so that the writings of the prophets would be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples deserted Him and fled.</verse>
  <verse number="57">Those who had arrested Jesus led Him away to the house of Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and elders had gathered.</verse>
  <verse number="58">But Peter followed Him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. And he went in and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.</verse>
  <verse number="59">Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus in order to put Him to death.</verse>
  <verse number="60">But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two came forward</verse>
  <verse number="61">and declared, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.’”</verse>
  <verse number="62">So the high priest stood up and asked Him, “Have You no answer? What are these men testifying against You?”</verse>
  <verse number="63">But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to Him, “I charge You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God.”</verse>
  <verse number="64">“You have said it yourself,” Jesus answered. “But I say to all of you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</verse>
  <verse number="65">At this, the high priest tore his clothes and declared, “He has blasphemed! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.</verse>
  <verse number="66">What do you think?” “He deserves to die,” they answered.</verse>
  <verse number="67">Then they spit in His face and struck Him. Others slapped Him</verse>
  <verse number="68">and said, “Prophesy to us, Christ! Who hit You?”</verse>
  <verse number="69">Meanwhile, Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came up to him. “You also were with Jesus the Galilean,” she said.</verse>
  <verse number="70">But he denied it before them all: “I do not know what you are talking about.”</verse>
  <verse number="71">When Peter had gone out to the gateway, another servant girl saw him and said to the people there, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.”</verse>
  <verse number="72">And again he denied it with an oath: “I do not know the man!”</verse>
  <verse number="73">After a little while, those standing nearby came up to Peter. “Surely you are one of them,” they said, “for your accent gives you away.”</verse>
  <verse number="74">At that he began to curse and swear to them, “I do not know the man!” And immediately a rooster crowed.</verse>
  <verse number="75">Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had spoken: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.</verse>
