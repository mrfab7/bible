  <verse number="1">And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened himself against Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he placed forces in all the fortified cities of Judah, and set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the first ways of his father David, and sought not to Baalim;</verse>
  <verse number="4">But sought to the LORD God of his father, and walked in his commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Therefore the LORD established the kingdom in his hand: and all Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and honor in abundance.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes, even to Ben-hail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah, and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah, Levites; and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah, and taught the people.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were around Judah, so that they made no war against Jehoshaphat.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven hundred he-goats.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Jehoshaphat became exceedingly great; and he built in Judah castles, and cities of store.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men of war, mighty men of valor, were in Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And these are the numbers of them according to the house of their fathers: of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the chief, and with him mighty men of valor three hundred thousand.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two hundred and eighty thousand.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And next to him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself to the LORD; and with him two hundred thousand mighty men of valor.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valor, and with him armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And next to him was Jehozabad, and with him a hundred and eighty thousand ready prepared for the war.</verse>
  <verse number="19">These waited on the king, besides those whom the king put in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.</verse>
