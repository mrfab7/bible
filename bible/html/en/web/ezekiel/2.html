<p class="verse" data-verse="1">He said to me, Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me on my feet; and I heard him who spoke to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He said to me, Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a nation of rebels who have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The children are impudent and stiff-hearted: I am sending you to them; and you shall tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">They, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house), yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">You, son of man, don’t be afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you, and you do dwell among scorpions: don’t be afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">You shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear; for they are most rebellious.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But you, son of man, hear what I tell you; don’t be rebellious like that rebellious house: open your mouth, and eat that which I give you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">When I looked, behold, a hand was put forth to me; and, behold, a scroll of a book was therein;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He spread it before me: and it was written within and without; and there were written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</p>
