  <verse number="1">The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.</verse>
  <verse number="2">The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="3">The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, said the LORD of hosts.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And it shall be as when the harvestman gathers the corn, and reaps the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathers ears in the valley of Rephaim.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, said the LORD God of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="7">At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands, neither shall respect that which his fingers have made, either the groves, or the images.</verse>
  <verse number="9">In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough, and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the children of Israel: and there shall be desolation.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Because you have forgotten the God of your salvation, and have not been mindful of the rock of your strength, therefore shall you plant pleasant plants, and shall set it with strange slips:</verse>
  <verse number="11">In the day shall you make your plant to grow, and in the morning shall you make your seed to flourish: but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!</verse>
  <verse number="13">The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And behold at evening trouble; and before the morning he is not. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot of them that rob us.</verse>
