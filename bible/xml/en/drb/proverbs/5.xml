<chapter book="Proverbs" number="5" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">My son, attend to my wisdom, and incline thy ear to my prudence.</verse>
  <verse number="2">That thou mayst keep thoughts, and thy lips may preserve instruction. Mind not the deceit of a woman.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the lips of a harlot are like a honeycomb dropping, and her throat is smoother than oil.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But her end is bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Her feet go down into death, and her steps go in as far as hell.</verse>
  <verse number="6">They walk not by the path of life, her steps are wandering, and unaccountable.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now therefore, my son, hear me, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the doors of her house.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Give not thy honour to strangers, and thy years to the cruel.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, and thy labours be in another man’s house,</verse>
  <verse number="11">And thou mourn it the last, when thou shalt have spent thy flesh and thy body, and say:</verse>
  <verse number="12">Why have I hated instruction, and my heart consented not to reproof,</verse>
  <verse number="13">And have not heard the voice of them that taught me, and have not in- dined my ear to masters?</verse>
  <verse number="14">I have almost been in all evil, in the midst of the church and of the congregation.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Drink water out of thy own cistern, and the streams of thy own well:</verse>
  <verse number="16">Let thy fountains be conveyed abroad, and in the streets divide thy waters.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Keep them to thyself alone, neither let strangers be partakers with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Let thy vein be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of thy youth:</verse>
  <verse number="19">Let her be thy dearest hind, and most agreeable fawn: let her breasts inebriate thee at all times; he thou delighted continually with her love.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Why art thou seduced, my son, by a strange woman, and art cherished in the bosom of another ?</verse>
  <verse number="21">The Lord beholdeth the ways of man, and considereth all his steps.</verse>
  <verse number="22">His own iniquities catch the wicked, and he is fast bound with the ropes of his own sins.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He shall die, because he hath not received instruction, and in the multitude of his folly he shall be deceived.</verse>
