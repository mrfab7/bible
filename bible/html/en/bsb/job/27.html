<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Job continued his discourse:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“As surely as God lives, who has deprived me of justice—the Almighty, who has embittered my soul—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">as long as my breath is still within me and the breath of God remains in my nostrils,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">my lips will not speak wickedness, and my tongue will not utter deceit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I will never say that you are right; I will maintain my integrity until I die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I will cling to my righteousness and never let go. As long as I live, my conscience will not accuse me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">May my enemy be like the wicked and my opponent like the unjust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For what is the hope of the godless when he is cut off, when God takes away his life?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Will God hear his cry when distress comes upon him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Will he delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I will instruct you in the power of God. I will not conceal the ways of the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Surely all of you have seen it for yourselves. Why then do you keep up this empty talk?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">This is the wicked man’s portion from God—the heritage the ruthless receive from the Almighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Though his sons are many, they are destined for the sword; and his offspring will never have enough food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">His survivors will be buried by the plague, and their widows will not weep for them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Though he heaps up silver like dust and piles up a wardrobe like clay,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">what he lays up, the righteous will wear, and his silver will be divided by the innocent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The house he built is like a moth’s cocoon, like a hut set up by a watchman.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more; when he opens his eyes, all is gone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Terrors overtake him like a flood; a tempest sweeps him away in the night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">The east wind carries him away, and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">It hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">It claps its hands at him and hisses him out of his place.</p>
