1	The elder to the dearly beloved Gains, whom I love in truth.
2	Dearly beloved, I pray above all things that thou succeed and be in good health, as thy soul succeeds.
3	For I was greatly rejoiced, the brethren coming and testifying to thy truth, as thou walkest about in the truth.
4	I have no joy greater than these that I hear my children walking in truth.
5	Dearly beloved, thou doest faithfully whatever thou dost work for the brethren, and for strangers;
6	Who testified to thy love before the church: thou shalt do well, having sent them forward worthily of God.
7	For, for his name went they forth, receiving nothing from the nations.
8	Therefore ought we to receive such, that we might be workers together in the truth.
9	I wrote to the church: but Diotrephes, seeking the superiority over them, receives us not.
10	Therefore, if I should come, I will put him in mind of his works which he does, talking silly against us with evil words: and not being satisfied in these, neither does he himself receive the brethren, and hinders those being willing, and casts out of the church.
11	Dearly beloved, imitate not evil, but good. He doing good is of God: and he doing evil has not seen God.
12	It has been testified to Demetrius by all, and by the truth itself: and we also testify; and know that our testimony is true.
13	I have many things to write, but I will not by ink and pen write to thee:
14	And I hope presently to see thee, and we will speak mouth to mouth. Peace to thee. The friends greet thee. Greet the friends by name.
