<div class="chapter" data-book="Ecclesiastes" data-chapter="1" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">These are the words of the Teacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Futility of futilities,” says the Teacher, “futility of futilities! Everything is futile!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">What does a man gain from all his labor, at which he toils under the sun?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The sun rises and the sun sets; it hurries back to where it rises.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The wind blows southward, then turns northward; round and round it swirls, ever returning on its course.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All the rivers flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full; to the place from which the streams come, there again they flow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">All things are wearisome, more than one can describe; the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear content with hearing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What has been will be again, and what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Is there a case where one can say, “Look, this is new”? It has already existed in the ages before us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">There is no remembrance of those who came before, and those yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow after.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And I set my mind to seek and explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven. What a miserable task God has laid upon the sons of men to occupy them!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I have seen all the things that are done under the sun, and have found them all to be futile, a pursuit of the wind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">What is crooked cannot be straightened, and what is lacking cannot be counted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I said to myself, “Behold, I have grown and increased in wisdom beyond all those before me who were over Jerusalem, and my mind has observed a wealth of wisdom and knowledge.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">So I set my mind to know wisdom and madness and folly; I learned that this, too, is a pursuit of the wind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For with much wisdom comes much sorrow, and as knowledge grows, grief increases.</p>
