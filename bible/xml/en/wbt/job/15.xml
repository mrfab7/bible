  <verse number="1">Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Should a wise men utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches with which he can do no good?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Yes, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For thy mouth uttereth thy iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Thy own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yes, thy own lips testify against thee.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?</verse>
  <verse number="9">What knowest thou that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us?</verse>
  <verse number="10">With us are both the gray headed and very aged men, much older than thy father.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Why doth thy heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,</verse>
  <verse number="13">That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?</verse>
  <verse number="14">What is man, that he should be clean? and he who is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight.</verse>
  <verse number="16">How much more abominable and filthy is man, who drinketh iniquity like water?</verse>
  <verse number="17">I will show thee, hear me; and that which I have seen, I will declare;</verse>
  <verse number="18">Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:</verse>
  <verse number="19">To whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.</verse>
  <verse number="21">A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for by the sword.</verse>
  <verse number="23">He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.</verse>
  <verse number="26">He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:</verse>
  <verse number="27">Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.</verse>
  <verse number="29">He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection of it upon the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="30">He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompense.</verse>
  <verse number="32">It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.</verse>
  <verse number="33">He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.</verse>
  <verse number="35">They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.</verse>
