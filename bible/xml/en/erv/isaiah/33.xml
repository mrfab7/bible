  <verse number="1">Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee!

  <verse number="15">He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from looking upon evil;</verse>
  <verse number="16">He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: his bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold a far stretching land.</verse>
