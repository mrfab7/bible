1	For truly, concerning the service to the holy ones, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
2	For I know your forwardness, which I boast of for you to the Macedonians, that Achaia was prepared from last year; and zeal from you excited the many more.
3	And I sent the brethren, lest our boasting for you be empty in this part; that, as I said, ye might be prepared:
4	Lest if in some way the Macedonians come with me, and find you unprepared, we should be ashamed, (that we should not say, ye) in this principle of boasting.
5	Therefore I thought necessary to beseech the brethren that they go before to you, and prepare beforehand your praise, having been proclaimed beforehand, this same to be prepared, so as praise, and not as covetousness.
6	And this, He sowing sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he sowing in praises shall reap also in praises.
7	Each as he chooses in the heart; not of grief, or of necessity: for God loves a cheerful giver.
8	And God able for all grace to abound in you; having always all sufficiency in everything, ye abound in every good work:
9	(As has been written, He scattered; he gave to the poor: his justice remains forever.
10	And now he furnishing seed to him sowing, and bread for food, furnish and multiply your sowing-season, and increase the fruits of your justice;)
11	Enriched in everything in all simplicity, which works through us gratitude to God.
12	For the service of this office is not only filling up the wants of the saints, but also abounding through many thanks to God;
13	By the proof of this service honouring God for the subjection of your assent to the good news of Christ, and to the simplicity of mutual participation to them and to all;
14	And by their prayer for you, longing for you through the exceeding grace of God upon you.
15	And grace to God for his indescribable gift.
