<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover Elihu answered and said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thinkest thou this to be thy right, Or sayest thou: ‘I am righteousness before God’,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">That thou inquirest: ‘What advantage will it be unto Thee?’ And: ‘What profit shall I have, more than if I had sinned?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I will give thee answer, And thy companions with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Look unto the heavens, and see; And behold the skies, which are higher than thou.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If thou hast sinned, what doest thou against Him? And if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto Him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If thou be righteous, what givest thou Him? Or what receiveth He of thy hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Thy wickedness concerneth a man as thou art; And thy righteousness a son of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">By reason of the multitude of oppressions they cry out; They cry for help by reason of the arm of the mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But none saith: ‘Where is God my Maker, Who giveth songs in the night;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, And maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">There they cry, but none giveth answer, Because of the pride of evil men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Surely God will not hear vanity, Neither will the Almighty regard it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Yea, when thou sayest thou canst not see Him—The cause is before Him; therefore wait thou for Him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And now, is it for nought that He punished in His anger? And hath He not full knowledge of arrogance?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But Job doth open his mouth in vanity; He multiplieth words without knowledge.</p>
