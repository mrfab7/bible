<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then said the LORD to me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods, and love flagons of wine.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And I said to her, You shall abide for me many days; you shall not play the harlot, and you shall not be for another man: so will I also be for you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD and his goodness in the latter days.</p>
