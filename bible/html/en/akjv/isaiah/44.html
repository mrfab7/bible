<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thus said the LORD that made you, and formed you from the womb, which will help you; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and you, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For I will pour water on him that is thirsty, and floods on the dry ground: I will pour my spirit on your seed, and my blessing on your offspring:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">One shall say, I am the LORDâ€™s; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand to the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thus said the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them show to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Fear you not, neither be afraid: have not I told you from that time, and have declared it? you are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yes, there is no God; I know not any.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Who has formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The smith with the tongs both works in the coals, and fashions it with hammers, and works it with the strength of his arms: yes, he is hungry, and his strength fails: he drinks no water, and is faint.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The carpenter stretches out his rule; he marks it out with a line; he fits it with planes, and he marks it out with the compass, and makes it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He hews him down cedars, and takes the cypress and the oak, which he strengthens for himself among the trees of the forest: he plants an ash, and the rain does nourish it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yes, he kindles it, and bakes bread; yes, he makes a god, and worships it; he makes it a graven image, and falls down thereto.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He burns part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eats flesh; he roasts roast, and is satisfied: yes, he warms himself, and said, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the residue thereof he makes a god, even his graven image: he falls down to it, and worships it, and prays to it, and said, Deliver me; for you are my god.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">They have not known nor understood: for he has shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And none considers in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yes, also I have baked bread on the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">He feeds on ashes: a deceived heart has turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for you are my servant: I have formed you; you are my servant: O Israel, you shall not be forgotten of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions, and, as a cloud, your sins: return to me; for I have redeemed you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Sing, O you heavens; for the LORD has done it: shout, you lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, you mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD has redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Thus said the LORD, your redeemer, and he that formed you from the womb, I am the LORD that makes all things; that stretches forth the heavens alone; that spreads abroad the earth by myself;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">That frustrates the tokens of the liars, and makes diviners mad; that turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">That confirms the word of his servant, and performes the counsel of his messengers; that said to Jerusalem, You shall be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, You shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">That said to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up your rivers:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">That said of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.</p>
