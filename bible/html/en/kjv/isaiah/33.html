<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou [wast] not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; [and] when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And your spoil shall be gathered [like] the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, [and] strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD [is] his treasure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The earth mourneth [and] languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed [and] hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off [their fruits].</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, [as] fire, shall devour you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the people shall be [as] the burnings of lime: [as] thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hear, ye [that are] far off, what I have done; and, ye [that are] near, acknowledge my might.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He shall dwell on high: his place of defence [shall be] the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters [shall be] sure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where [is] the scribe? where [is] the receiver? where [is] he that counted the towers?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, [that thou canst] not understand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle [that] shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But there the glorious LORD [will be] unto us a place of broad rivers [and] streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For the LORD [is] our judge, the LORD [is] our lawgiver, the LORD [is] our king; he will save us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein [shall be] forgiven [their] iniquity.</p>
