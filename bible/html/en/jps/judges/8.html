<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the men of Ephraim said unto him: ‘Why hast thou served us thus, that thou didst not call us when thou wentest to fight with Midian?’ And they did chide with him sharply.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he said unto them: ‘What have I now done in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">God hath delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and what was I able to do in comparison with you?’ Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And Gideon came to the Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And he said unto the men of Succoth: ‘Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the princes of Succoth said: ‘Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy power, that we should give bread unto thine army?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And Gideon said: ‘Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he went up thence to Penuel, and spoke unto them in like manner; and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he spoke also unto the men of Penuel, saying: ‘When I come back in peace, I will break down this tower.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the host of the children of the east; for there fell a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was secure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued after them; and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from the ascent of Heres.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him; and he wrote down for him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, seventy and seven men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said: ‘Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, concerning whom ye did taunt me, saying: Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy power, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he broke down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna: ‘Where are the men whom ye slew at Tabor?’ And they answered: ‘As thou art, so were they; of one form with the children of a king.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And he said: ‘They were my brethren, the sons of my mother; as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And he said unto Jether his first-born: ‘Up, and slay them.’ But the youth drew not his sword; for he feared, because he was yet a youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Then Zebah and Zalmunna said: ‘Rise thou, and fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength.’ And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that were on their camels’ necks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon: ‘Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son also; for thou hast saved us out of the hand of Midian.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Gideon said unto them: ‘I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you; the LORD shall rule over you.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Gideon said unto them: ‘I would make a request of you, that ye would give me every man the ear-rings of his spoil.’—For they had golden ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And they answered: ‘We will willingly give them.’ And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the ear-rings of his spoil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And the weight of the golden ear-rings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside the crescents, and the pendants, and the purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels’ necks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah; and all Israel went astray after it there; and it became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten; for he had many wives.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, and he called his name Abimelech.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel again went astray after the Baalim, and made Baal-berith their god.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies on every side;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">neither showed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shown unto Israel.</p>
