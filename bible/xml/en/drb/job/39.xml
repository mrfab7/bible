  <verse number="1">Knowest thou the time when the wild goats bring forth among the rocks, or hast thou observed the hinds when they fawn?</verse>
  <verse number="2">Hast thou numbered the months of their conceiving, or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?</verse>
  <verse number="3">They bow themselves to bring forth young, and they cast them, and send forth roarings.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Their young are weaned and go to feed : they go forth, and return not to them.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Who hath sent out the wild ass free, and who hath loosed his bonds?</verse>
  <verse number="6">To whom I have given a house in the wilderness, and his dwellings in the barren land.</verse>
  <verse number="7">He scorneth the multitude of the city, he heareth not the cry of the driver.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He looketh round about the mountains of his pasture, and seeketh for every green thing.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Shall the rhinoceros be willing to serve thee, or will he stay at thy crib?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Canst thou bind the rhinoceros with thy thong to plough, or will he break the clods of the valleys after thee?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Wilt thou have confidence in his great strength, and leave thy labours to him?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Wilt thou trust him that he will render thee the seed, and gather it into thy barnfloor?</verse>
  <verse number="13">The wing of the ostrich is like the wings of the heron, and of the hawk.</verse>
  <verse number="14">When she leaveth her eggs on the earth, thou perhaps wilt warm them in the dust.</verse>
  <verse number="15">She forgetteth that the foot may tread upon them, or that the beasts of the field may break them.</verse>
  <verse number="16">She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers, she hath laboured in vain, no fear constraining her.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he given her understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="18">When time shall be, she setteth up her wings on high : she scorneth the horse and his rider.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Wilt thou give strength to the horse, or clothe his neck with neighing?</verse>
  <verse number="20">Wilt thou lift him up like the locusts? the glory of his nostrils is terror.</verse>
  <verse number="21">He breaketh up the earth with his hoof, he pranceth boldly, he goeth forward to meet armed men.</verse>
  <verse number="22">He despiseth fear, he turneth not his back to the sword,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Above him shall the quiver rattle, the spear and shield shall glitter.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Chasing and raging he swalloweth the ground, neither doth he make account when the noise of the trumpet soundeth.</verse>
  <verse number="25">When he heareth the trumpet he saith : Ha, ha : he smelleth the battle afar off, the encouraging of the captains, and the shouting of the army.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Doth the hawk wax feathered by thy wisdom, spreading her wings to the south?</verse>
  <verse number="27">Will the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest in high places?</verse>
  <verse number="28">She abideth among the rocks, and dwelleth among cragged flints, and stony hills, where there is no access.</verse>
  <verse number="29">From thence she looketh for the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Her young ones shall suck up blood : and wheresoever the carcass shall be, she is immediately there.</verse>
