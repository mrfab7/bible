<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="5" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">IT is absolutely heard, that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as the like is not among the heathens; that one should have his fatherâ€™s wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And you are puffed up; and have not rather mourned, that he might be taken away from among you, that hath done this deed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I indeed, absent in body, but present in spirit, have already judged, as though I were present, him that hath so done,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven corrupteth the whole lump ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new paste, as you are unleavened. For Christ our pasch is sacrificed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Therefore let us feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I wrote to you in an epistle, not to keep company with fornicators.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I mean not with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or the extortioners, or the servers of idols; otherwise you must needs go out of this world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">But now I have written to you, not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, or a server of idols, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner: with such a one, not so much as to eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For what have I to do to judge them that are without ? Do not you judge them that are within ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For them that are without, God will judge. Put away the evil one from among yourselves.</p>
