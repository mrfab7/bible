<p class="verse" data-verse="1">A [good] name is rather to be chosen than great riches; loving favour rather than silver and gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The rich and poor meet together; Jehovah is the maker of them all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A prudent [man] seeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The reward of humility [and] the fear of Jehovah is riches, and honour, and life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Thorns [and] snares are in the way of the perverse: he that keepeth his soul holdeth himself far from them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Train up the child according to the tenor of his way, and when he is old he will not depart from it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The rich ruleth over the poor; and the borrower is servant to the lender.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He that soweth unrighteousness shall reap iniquity, and the rod of his wrath shall have an end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed, for he giveth of his bread to the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Cast out the scorner, and contention will depart, and strife and ignominy shall cease.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He that loveth pureness of heart, upon whose lips is grace, the king is his friend.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The eyes of Jehovah preserve knowledge; but he overthroweth the words of the unfaithful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The sluggard saith, There is a lion without, I shall be killed in the streets!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The mouth of strange women is a deep ditch: he with whom Jehovah is displeased shall fall therein.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Folly is bound in the heart of a child; the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He that oppresseth the poor, it is to enrich him; he that giveth to the rich, [bringeth] only to want.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Incline thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thy heart unto my knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee: they shall be together fitted on thy lips.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">That thy confidence may be in Jehovah, I have made [them] known to thee this day, even to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Have not I written to thee excellent things, in counsels and knowledge,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">that I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest carry back words of truth to them that send thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Rob not the poor, because he is poor, neither oppress the afflicted in the gate;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">for Jehovah will plead their cause, and despoil the soul of those that despoil them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Make no friendship with an angry man, and go not with a furious man;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">lest thou learn his paths, and get a snare to thy soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Be not of them that strike hands, of them that are sureties for debts:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">if thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have set.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Hast thou seen a man diligent in his work? He shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before the mean.</p>
