<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="13" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.</verse>
  <verse number="2">I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:</verse>
  <verse number="3">Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Examine yourselves, whether you be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know you not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be reprobates?</verse>
  <verse number="6">But I trust that you shall know that we are not reprobates.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Now I pray to God that you do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that you should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For we are glad, when we are weak, and you are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord has given me to edification, and not to destruction.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Finally, brothers, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Greet one another with an holy kiss.</verse>
  <verse number="13">All the saints salute you.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.</verse>
