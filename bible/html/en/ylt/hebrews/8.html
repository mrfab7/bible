<div class="chapter" data-book="Hebrews" data-chapter="8" data-translation="Young's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="ylt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the sum concerning the things spoken of is: we have such a chief priest, who did sit down at the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">of the holy places a servant, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord did set up, and not man,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">for every chief priest to offer both gifts and sacrifices is appointed, whence it is necessary for this one to have also something that he may offer;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">for if, indeed, he were upon earth, he would not be a priest—(there being the priests who are offering according to the law, the gifts,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">who unto an example and shadow do serve of the heavenly things, as Moses hath been divinely warned, being about to construct the tabernacle, for ‘See (saith He) thou mayest make all things according to the pattern that was shewn to thee in the mount;’)—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and now he hath obtained a more excellent service, how much also of a better covenant is he mediator, which on better promises hath been sanctioned,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">for if that first were faultless, a place would not have been sought for a second.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For finding fault, He saith to them, ‘Lo, days come, saith the Lord, and I will complete with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah, a new covenant,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day of My taking them by their hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt—because they did not remain in My covenant, and I did not regard them, saith the Lord,—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">because this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, saith the Lord, giving My laws into their mind, and upon their hearts I will write them, and I will be to them for a God, and they shall be to Me for a people;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and they shall not teach each his neighbour, and each his brother, saying, Know thou the Lord, because they shall all know Me from the small one of them unto the great one of them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will remember no more;’—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">in the saying ‘new,’ He hath made the first old, and what doth become obsolete and is old is nigh disappearing.</p>
