<p class="verse" data-verse="1">These have I spoken, that ye should not be offended.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">They shall make you excluded from the synagogue: but the hour comes that every one having slain you should think to bring service to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And these things shall they do to you, for they know not the Father, nor me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But these have I spoken to you, that when the hour should come, ye should remember them, for I said to you. And these I said not to you from the beginning, for I was with you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But now do I retire to him having sent me; and not one of you asks me, Where dost thou retire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But because I have spoken these to you, sorrow has filled your heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But I say the truth to you; it is profitable to you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Intercessor shall not come to you; and if I go, I will send him to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And having come, he will convict the world of sin, and of justice, and of judgment:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Truly of sin, because they believe not in me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And of justice, because I retire to my Father, and ye see me no more;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And of judgment, for the ruler of this world has been judged.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I have yet many things to say to you, but ye cannot bear them now.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And when he should come, the Spirit of truth, he shall guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he should hear, shall he speak: and he shall announce to you the things coming.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">He shall honour me: for he shall take of mine, and announce to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All things which the Father has are mine: therefore said I, he shall take of mine, and announce to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A little while, and ye see me not: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, and because I retire to the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Then said of his disciples to one another, What is this which he says to you, A little, and ye see me not: and again, a little, and ye shall see me: and, Because I retire to my Father?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then said they, What is this which he says, A little we know not what he says.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Then knew Jesus that they wished to ask him, and he said to them, For this seek ye with one another that I said, A little while, and ye see me not; and again a little, and ye shall see me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Truly, truly, I say to you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be grieved, but your grief shall be into joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">A woman when she should bring forth, has grief, because her hour has come: and when the child should be born, she no more remembers the anguish, for the joy that a man was born into the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And where truly ye now have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no one takes away from you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, That whatever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Until now ye have asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy might be completed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">These have I spoken to you in proverbs: but the hour comes, when I shall no more speak to you in proverbs, but with freedom of speech will I announce to you of the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">In that day shall ye ask in my name: and I say not to you that I will ask the Father for you:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For the Father himself loves you, for ye have loved me, and believed that I came forth from God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">I came forth from the Father, and have come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">His disciples say to him, See, now thou speakest with freedom of speech, and sayest no proverb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Now we know that thou knowest all things, and hast no need that any ask thee: by this we believe that thou earnest forth from God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Jesus answered them, Now do ye believe?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Behold, the hour comes, and has now come, that ye be scattered, each to his own, and leave me alone: and I am not alone, for the Father is with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">These have I spoken to you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world shall ye have pressure; but take courage; I have conquered the world.</p>
