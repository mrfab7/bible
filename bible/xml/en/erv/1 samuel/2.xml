<chapter book="1 Samuel" number="2" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And Hannah prayed, and said: My heart exulteth in the LORD, mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="2">There is none holy as the LORD; for there is none beside thee: neither is there any rock like our God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.</verse>
  <verse number="5">They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry have ceased: yea, the barren hath borne seven; and she that hath many children languisheth.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, he also lifteth up.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, he lifteth up the needy from the dunghill, to make them sit with princes, and inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD’S, and he hath set the world upon them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He will keep the feet of his holy ones, but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</verse>
  <verse number="10">They that strive with the LORD shall be broken to pieces; against them shall he thunder in heaven: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;</verse>
  <verse number="14">and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took therewith. So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came thither.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Yea, before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And if the man said unto him, They will surely burn the fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth; then he would say, Nay, but thou shalt give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give thee seed of this woman for the loan which was lent to the LORD. And they went unto their own home.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the LORD visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bare three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did unto all Israel, and how that they lay with the women that did service at the door of the tent of meeting.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make the LORD’S people to transgress.</verse>
  <verse number="25">If one man sin against another, God shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the LORD, and also with men.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Did I reveal myself unto the house of thy father, when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house?</verse>
  <verse number="28">and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up unto mine altar to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?</verse>
  <verse number="29">Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?</verse>
  <verse number="30">Therefore the LORD, the God of Israel, saith, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in thine house.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And thou shalt behold the affliction of my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in thine house for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the flower of their age.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And this shall be the sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine anointed for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in thine house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.</verse>
