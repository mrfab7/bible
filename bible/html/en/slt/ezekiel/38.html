<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the head prince of Meeheoh and Tubal, and prophesy against him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And say, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me against thee, O Gog, head prince of the head of Meshech and Tubal:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I turned thee back, and I gave hooks in thy jaw bones, and I brought thee forth and all thine army of horses and horsemen, clothed in perfection, all of them a great convocation with buckler and shield, holding swords all of them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Persia, Cush and Phut with them, all of them with shield and helmet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Gomer and all his hosts; the house of Togarmah of the thighs of the north, and all his hosts: many peoples with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Be prepared, and be prepared for thyself, thou, and all thy convocation convoked together to thee, and be to them for watching.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">From many days thou shalt be reviewed: in the last of the years thou shalt come to the land turned back from the sword, being gathered from many peoples upon the mountains of Israel, which were continually for waste: and she was brought forth from the peoples, and they dwelt confidently all of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Ascending, thou shalt come as a storm, as a cloud to cover the earth shalt thou be and all thy hosts, and many peoples with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Thus said the Lord Jehovah and it was in that day words will come up upon thy heart, and thou purposed an evil purpose:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And thou saidst, I will come up upon the land of the open country; I will go to those being at rest, dwelling confidently, all of them dwelling without a wall, and bar and doors not to them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">To spoil a spoil and to plunder a plunder; to turn back thy hand upon the wastes being inhabited, and upon the people being gathered out of the nations making cattle and substance, dwelling upon the summit of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish, and all her young lions, they shall say to thee, For spoiling a spoil art thou come? For plundering a plunder didst thou call together thy convocation? to lift up silver and gold, to take cattle and substance, to spoil a great spoil?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For this, prophesy, O son of man, and say to Gog, Thus said the Lord Jehovah: In that day in my people Israel dwelling confidently, shalt thou not know?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And thou earnest out of the places from the thighs of the north, thou, and many peoples with thee, riding horses all of them, a great convocation and much strength:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And coming up upon my people Israel as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the last of the days, and brought thee forth against my land, for the nations to know me in my being consecrated in thee before their eyes, O Gog.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: Art thou he of whom I spake in days of old by the hand of my servants the prophets of Israel, prophesying in those days years to bring thee against them?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And it was in that day, in the day Gog came upon the land of Israel, says the Lord Jehovah, my wrath shall come up in my face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And in my jealousy, in the fire of my wrath I spake, If not in that day shall be a great shaking upon the land of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And from my face shall shake the fish of the sea, and the birds of the heavens, and the beasts of the field, and every creeping thing creeping upon the earth, and every man which is upon the face of the earth; and the mountains were overthrown, and the precipices fell, and every wall shall fall to the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And I called to all my mountains a sword against him, says the Lord Jehovah: and the sword of each shall be against his brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And I will contend with him with death and with blood; and an overflowing rain, and hailstones, fire and sulphur will I rain upon him and upon his hosts, and upon many peoples which are with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And I magnified myself, and I consecrated myself; and I was made known to the eyes of many nations, and they knew that I am Jehovah.</p>
