<chapter book="Job" number="35" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And Elihu went on to say:</verse>
  <verse number="2">“Do you think this is just? You say, ‘I am more righteous than God.’</verse>
  <verse number="3">For you ask, ‘What does it profit me, and what benefit do I gain apart from sin?’</verse>
  <verse number="4">I will reply to you and to your friends as well.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Look to the heavens and see; gaze at the clouds high above you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">If you sin, what do you accomplish against Him? If you multiply your transgressions, what do you do to Him?</verse>
  <verse number="7">If you are righteous, what do you give Him, or what does He receive from your hand?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Your wickedness affects only a man like yourself, and your righteousness only a son of man.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Men cry out under great oppression; they plead for relief from the arm of the mighty.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But no one asks, ‘Where is God my Maker, who gives us songs in the night,</verse>
  <verse number="11">who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the air?’</verse>
  <verse number="12">There they cry out, but He does not answer, because of the pride of evil men.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Surely God does not listen to empty pleas, and the Almighty does not take note of it.</verse>
  <verse number="14">How much less, then, when you say that you do not see Him, that your case is before Him and you must wait for Him,</verse>
  <verse number="15">and further, that in His anger He has not punished or taken much notice of folly!</verse>
  <verse number="16">So Job opens his mouth in vain and multiplies words without knowledge.”</verse>
