<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Bildad the Shuhite answereth and saith:—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The rule and fear are with Him, Making peace in His high places.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is their any number to His troops? And on whom ariseth not His light?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And what? is man righteous with God? And what? is he pure—born of a woman?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Lo—unto the moon, and it shineth not, And stars have not been pure in His eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">How much less man—a grub, And the son of man—a worm!</p>
