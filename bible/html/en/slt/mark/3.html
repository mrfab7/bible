<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And he went again into the synagogue; and a man was there having the hand dried up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And they were observing him narrowly, if in the sabbaths he will heal him; that they might accuse him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And he says to the man having the hand dried up, Rise in the midst.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he says to them, Is it lawful in the sabbaths to do good, or to do evil? to save a soul, or to kill? And they were silent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And having looked round upon them with anger, grieved for the hardness of their heart, he says to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched out: and his hand was restored whole as the other.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the Pharisees having come out, quickly with the Herodians were making counsel against him, that they might destroy him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And Jesus withdrew with, his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judea,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, having heard what he did, came to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he said to his disciples, that a small vessel should remain for him, on account of the crowd, that they might not press him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For he cured many; so as to fall upon him that they might touch him, as many as had plagues.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell before him, and cried, saying, That thou art the Son of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And he censured them much, lest they should make him manifest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And he goes up to a mountain, and calls whom he would: and they came to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And he made the twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them forth to proclaim,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And have power to cure diseases, and cast out demons:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he set to Simon the name Peter;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And James, him of Zebedee, and John brother of James; and he set to them names Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James him of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Judas Iscariot, who also delivered him up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And they came into the house; and again came the crowd together, so that they could not even eat bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And they with him, having heard, came forth to take hold of him: for they said, That he is affected in mind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the scribes, they having come down from Jerusalem, said, That he has Beelzeboul, and that by the ruler of demons he casts out demons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And having called them, in parables spake he to them, How can Satan cast out Satan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And if Satan rise up against himself, and has been divided, he cannot stand, but has an end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">None can plunder the vessels of the strong, having entered his house, except he first bind the strong; then he will plunder his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Truly I say to you, That all sins shall be remitted to the sons of men, and defamations whatever they defame:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And whoever should defame against the Holy Spirit has no remission forever, but he is liable to the penalty of eternal condemnation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">For they said, He has an unclean spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Then came his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, they sent to him, calling him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And the crowd sat about him, and they said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without seek thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother, and my brethren?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And having looked round upon those sitting round about him, he says, Behold my mother and my brethren!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">For whoever should do the will of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and mother.</p>
