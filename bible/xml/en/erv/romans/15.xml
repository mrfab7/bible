  <verse number="1">Now we that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Let each one of us please his neighbour for that which is good, unto edifying.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For Christ also pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell upon me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that through patience and through comfort of the scriptures we might have hope.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of the same mind one with another according to Christ Jesus:</verse>
  <verse number="6">that with one accord ye may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Wherefore receive ye one another, even as Christ also received you, to the glory of God.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For I say that Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, that he might confirm the promises given unto the fathers,</verse>
  <verse number="9">and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, Therefore will I give praise unto thee among the Gentiles, And sing unto thy name.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; And let all the peoples praise him.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And again, Isaiah saith, There shall be the root of Jesse, And he that ariseth to rule over the Gentiles; On him shall the Gentiles hope.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, in the power of the Holy Ghost.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But I write the more boldly unto you in some measure, as putting you again in remembrance, because of the grace that was given me of God,</verse>
  <verse number="16">that I should be a minister of Christ Jesus unto the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be made acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I have therefore my glorying in Christ Jesus in things pertaining to God.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For I will not dare to speak of any things save those which Christ wrought through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed,</verse>
  <verse number="19">in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Ghost; so that from Jerusalem, and round about even unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="20">yea, making it my aim so to preach the gospel, not where Christ was already named, that I might not build upon another man’s foundation;</verse>
  <verse number="21">but, as it is written, They shall see, to whom no tidings of him came, And they who have not heard shall understand.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Wherefore also I was hindered these many times from coming to you:</verse>
  <verse number="23">but now, having no more any place in these regions, and having these many years a longing to come unto you,</verse>
  <verse number="24">whensoever I go unto Spain (for I hope to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first in some measure I shall have been satisfied with your company)—</verse>
  <verse number="25">but now, I say, I go unto Jerusalem, ministering unto the saints.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For it hath been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor among the saints that are at Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Yea, it hath been their good pleasure; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they owe it to them also to minister unto them in carnal things.</verse>
  <verse number="28">When therefore I have accomplished this, and have sealed to them this fruit, I will go on by you unto Spain.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And I know that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Now I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that ye strive together with me in your prayers to God for me;</verse>
  <verse number="31">that I may be delivered from them that are disobedient in Judaea, and that my ministration which I have for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints;</verse>
  <verse number="32">that I may come unto you in joy through the will of God, and together with you find rest.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.</verse>
