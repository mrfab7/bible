<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Corinthians" data-chapter="10" data-translation="American Standard Version" data-translation-id="asv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">For I would not, brethren, have you ignorant, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and were all baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and did all eat the same spiritual food;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of a spiritual rock that followed them: and the rock was Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Howbeit with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Neither let us make trial of the Lord, as some of them made trial, and perished by the serpents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Now these things happened unto them by way of example; and they were written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">There hath no temptation taken you but such as man can bear: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation make also the way of escape, that ye may be able to endure it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Wherefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not a communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not a communion of the body of Christ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">seeing that we, who are many, are one bread, one body: for we are all partake of the one bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Behold Israel after the flesh: have not they that eat the sacrifices communion with the altar?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">What say I then? that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God: and I would not that ye should have communion with demons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of demons: ye cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and of the table of demons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">All things are lawful; but not all things are expedient. All things are lawful; but not all things edify.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Let no man seek his own, but each his neighbor’s good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fulness thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">If one of them that believe not biddeth you to a feast, and ye are disposed to go; whatsoever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience’ sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">But if any man say unto you, This hath been offered in sacrifice, eat not, for his sake that showed it, and for conscience’ sake:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">conscience, I say, not thine own, but the other’s; for why is my liberty judged by another conscience?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">If I partake with thankfulness, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Give no occasion of stumbling, either to Jews, or to Greeks, or to the church of God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">even as I also please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of the many, that they may be saved.</p>
