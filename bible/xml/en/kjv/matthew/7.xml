  <verse number="1">Judge not, that ye be not judged.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam [is] in thine own eye?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you:</verse>
  <verse number="8">For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?</verse>
  <verse number="11">If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide [is] the gate, and broad [is] the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:</verse>
  <verse number="14">Because strait [is] the gate, and narrow [is] the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</verse>
  <verse number="17">Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="18">A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither [can] a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?</verse>
  <verse number="23">And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock:</verse>
  <verse number="25">And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:</verse>
  <verse number="27">And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people were astonished at his doctrine:</verse>
  <verse number="29">For he taught them as [one] having authority, and not as the scribes.</verse>
