<div class="chapter" data-book="Philemon" data-chapter="1" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellow laborer,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I thank my God, making mention of you always in my prayers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Hearing of your love and faith, which you have toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">That the communication of your faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by you, brother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Why, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin you that which is convenient,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Yet for loveâ€™s sake I rather beseech you, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I beseech you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Which in time past was to you unprofitable, but now profitable to you and to me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Whom I have sent again: you therefore receive him, that is, my own bowels:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Whom I would have retained with me, that in your stead he might have ministered to me in the bonds of the gospel:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But without your mind would I do nothing; that your benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that you should receive him for ever;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If you count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If he has wronged you, or owes you ought, put that on my account;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to you how you owe to me even your own self besides.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Yes, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Having confidence in your obedience I wrote to you, knowing that you will also do more than I say.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But with prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">There salute you Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow laborers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</p>
