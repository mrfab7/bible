  <verse number="1">After these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee, for he wouldn’t walk in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was at hand.</verse>
  <verse number="3">His brothers therefore said to him, “Depart from here, and go into Judea, that your disciples also may see your works which you do.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For no one does anything in secret, and himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, reveal yourself to the world.”</verse>
  <verse number="5">For even his brothers didn’t believe in him.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Jesus therefore said to them, “My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The world can’t hate you, but it hates me, because I testify about it, that its works are evil.</verse>
  <verse number="8">You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because my time is not yet fulfilled.”</verse>
  <verse number="9">Having said these things to them, he stayed in Galilee.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but as it were in secret.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The Jews therefore sought him at the feast, and said, “Where is he?”</verse>
  <verse number="12">There was much murmuring among the multitudes concerning him. Some said, “He is a good man.” Others said, “Not so, but he leads the multitude astray.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">Yet no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But when it was now the midst of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The Jews therefore marveled, saying, “How does this man know letters, having never been educated?”</verse>
  <verse number="16">Jesus therefore answered them, “My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="17">If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about the teaching, whether it is from God, or if I am speaking from myself.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory, but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Didn’t Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do you seek to kill me?”</verse>
  <verse number="20">The multitude answered, “You have a demon! Who seeks to kill you?”</verse>
  <verse number="21">Jesus answered them, “I did one work, and you all marvel because of it.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a boy.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If a boy receives circumcision on the Sabbath, that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me, because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath?</verse>
  <verse number="24">Don’t judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">Therefore some of them of Jerusalem said, “Isn’t this he whom they seek to kill?</verse>
  <verse number="26">Behold, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. Can it be that the rulers indeed know that this is truly the Christ?</verse>
  <verse number="27">However we know where this man comes from, but when the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.”</verse>
  <verse number="28">Jesus therefore cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, “You both know me, and know where I am from. I have not come of myself, but he who sent me is true, whom you don’t know.</verse>
  <verse number="29">I know him, because I am from him, and he sent me.”</verse>
  <verse number="30">They sought therefore to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.</verse>
  <verse number="31">But of the multitude, many believed in him. They said, “When the Christ comes, he won’t do more signs than those which this man has done, will he?”</verse>
  <verse number="32">The Pharisees heard the multitude murmuring these things concerning him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Then Jesus said, “I will be with you a little while longer, then I go to him who sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="34">You will seek me, and won’t find me; and where I am, you can’t come.”</verse>
  <verse number="35">The Jews therefore said among themselves, “Where will this man go that we won’t find him? Will he go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</verse>
  <verse number="36">What is this word that he said, ‘You will seek me, and won’t find me; and where I am, you can’t come’?”</verse>
  <verse number="37">Now on the last and greatest day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!</verse>
  <verse number="38">He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, from within him will flow rivers of living water.”</verse>
  <verse number="39">But he said this about the Spirit, which those believing in him were to receive. For the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus wasn’t yet glorified.</verse>
  <verse number="40">Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said, “This is truly the prophet.”</verse>
  <verse number="41">Others said, “This is the Christ.” But some said, “What, does the Christ come out of Galilee?</verse>
  <verse number="42">Hasn’t the Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?”</verse>
  <verse number="43">So there arose a division in the multitude because of him.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Some of them would have arrested him, but no one laid hands on him.</verse>
  <verse number="45">The officers therefore came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, “Why didn’t you bring him?”</verse>
  <verse number="46">The officers answered, “No man ever spoke like this man!”</verse>
  <verse number="47">The Pharisees therefore answered them, “You aren’t also led astray, are you?</verse>
  <verse number="48">Have any of the rulers believed in him, or of the Pharisees?</verse>
  <verse number="49">But this multitude that doesn’t know the law is accursed.”</verse>
  <verse number="50">Nicodemus (he who came to him by night, being one of them) said to them,</verse>
  <verse number="51">“Does our law judge a man, unless it first hears from him personally and knows what he does?”</verse>
  <verse number="52">They answered him, “Are you also from Galilee? Search, and see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee.”</verse>
  <verse number="53">Everyone went to his own house,</verse>
