<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom comes; go you out to meet him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the foolish said to the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go you rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But he answered and said, Truly I say to you, I know you not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man comes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For the kingdom of heaven is as a man traveling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered to them his goods.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But he that had received one went and dig in the earth, and hid his lordâ€™s money.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">After a long time the lord of those servants comes, and reckons with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, you delivered to me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His lord said to him, Well done, you good and faithful servant: you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, you delivered to me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things: enter you into the joy of your lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew you that you are an hard man, reaping where you have not sown, and gathering where you have not strewed:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And I was afraid, and went and hid your talent in the earth: see, there you have that is yours.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">His lord answered and said to him, You wicked and slothful servant, you knew that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strewed:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">You ought therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received my own with usury.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him which has ten talents.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">For to every one that has shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that has not shall be taken away even that which he has.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And cast you the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit on the throne of his glory:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Then shall the King say to them on his right hand, Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">For I was an hungered, and you gave me meat: I was thirsty, and you gave me drink: I was a stranger, and you took me in:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">Naked, and you clothed me: I was sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we you an hungered, and fed you? or thirsty, and gave you drink?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">When saw we you a stranger, and took you in? or naked, and clothed you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Or when saw we you sick, or in prison, and came to you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And the King shall answer and say to them, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you have done it to one of the least of these my brothers, you have done it to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Then shall he say also to them on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">For I was an hungered, and you gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">I was a stranger, and you took me not in: naked, and you clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and you visited me not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we you an hungered, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Then shall he answer them, saying, Truly I say to you, Inasmuch as you did it not to one of the least of these, you did it not to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</p>
