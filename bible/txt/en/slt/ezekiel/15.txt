1	And the word of Jehovah will be to me, saying,
2	Son of man, what is the tree of the vine above every tree, the vine-shoot which was upon the trees of the forest.
3	Shall wood be taken from it to do for work? or will they take from it a peg to hang upon it any vessel?
4	Behold, it was given to the fire to consume; the fire consumed its two ends, and the midst of it was burned. Will it succeed for work.
5	Behold, in its being whole, it will not do for work: but if the fire consumed it, and it was burnt, did it yet do for work?
6	For this, thus said the Lord Jehovah: As the tree of the vine upon the tree of the forest which I gave it to the fire for consuming, thus I gave the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
7	And I gave my face against them; they shall go forth from the fire, and the fire shall consume them; and they knew that I am Jehovah in my setting my face against them.
8	And I gave the land a desolation, because they transgressed a transgression, says the Lord Jehovah.
