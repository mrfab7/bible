1	And I shall turn back and lift up mine eyes and see, and behold, a roll flying.
2	And he will say to me, What seest thou? And saying, I see a roll flying; its length twenty by the cubit, and its breadth, ten by the cubit.
3	And he will say to me, This the curse going forth upon the face of all the earth: for every one stealing from thence was empty like it; and every one swearing from this was empty like it.
4	I brought it forth, says Jehovah of armies, and it came into the house of the thief, and into the house of him swearing for falsehood in my name: and it lodged in the midst of his house, and it finished it and its wood and its stones.
5	And the messenger speaking with me will go forth and say to me, Lift up now thine eyes and see what this going forth.
6	And saying, What is it? And he will say to me, This the ephah going forth. And he will say, This their eye in all the earth.
7	And behold, a talent of lead was lifted up: and this one woman sitting in the midst of the ephah.
8	And he will say, This injustice. And he will cast her into the midst of the ephah; and he will cast a stone of lead upon its mouth.
9	And I shall lift up mine eyes and see, and behold, two women will come forth, and the wind in their wings; and to them wings as the wings of the stork; and they shall lift up the ephah between the earth and between the heavens.
10	And saying to the messenger speaking with me, Whither do they carry the ephah?
11	And he will say to me, To build for it a house in the land of Shiner: and it was prepared, and set there upon her base.
