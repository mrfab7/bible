<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Eliphaz the Temanite answereth and saith:—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Doth a wise man answer with vain knowledge? And fill with an east wind his belly?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">To reason with a word not useful? And speeches—no profit in them?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Yea, thou dost make reverence void, And dost diminish meditation before God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For thy mouth teacheth thine iniquity, And thou chooseth the tongue of the subtile.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thy mouth declareth thee wicked, and not I, And thy lips testify against thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The first man art thou born? And before the heights wast thou formed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Of the secret counsel of God dost thou hear? And withdrawest thou unto thee wisdom?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">What hast thou known, and we know not? Understandest thou—and it is not with us?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Both the gray-headed And the very aged are among us—Greater than thy father in days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Too few for thee are the comforts of God? And a gentle word is with thee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">What—doth thine heart take thee away? And what—are thine eyes high?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For thou turnest against God thy spirit? And hast brought out words from thy mouth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What is man that he is pure, And that he is righteous, one born of woman?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Lo, in His holy ones He putteth no credence, And the heavens have not been pure in His eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Also—surely abominable and filthy Is man drinking as water perverseness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">I shew thee—hearken to me—And this I have seen and declare:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Which the wise declare—And have not hid—from their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">To them alone was the land given, And a stranger passed not over into their midst:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">‘All days of the wicked he is paining himself, And few years have been laid up for the terrible one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">A fearful voice is in his ears, In peace doth a destroyer come to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">He believeth not to return from darkness, And watched is he for the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He is wandering for bread—‘Where is it?’ He hath known that ready at his hand Is a day of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Terrify him do adversity and distress, They prevail over him As a king ready for a boaster.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For he stretched out against God his hand, And against the Mighty he maketh himself mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He runneth unto Him with a neck, With thick bosses of his shields.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For he hath covered his face with his fat, And maketh vigour over his confidence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And he inhabiteth cities cut off, houses not dwelt in, That have been ready to become heaps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He is not rich, nor doth his wealth rise, Nor doth he stretch out on earth their continuance.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">He turneth not aside from darkness, His tender branch doth a flame dry up, And he turneth aside at the breath of His mouth!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Let him not put credence in vanity, He hath been deceived, For vanity is his recompence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Not in his day is it completed, And his bending branch is not green.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">He shaketh off as a vine his unripe fruit, And casteth off as an olive his blossom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">For the company of the profane is gloomy, And fire hath consumed tents of bribery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">To conceive misery, and to bear iniquity, Even their heart doth prepare deceit.</p>
