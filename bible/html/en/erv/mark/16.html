<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And very early on the first day of the week, they come to the tomb when the sun was risen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they were saying among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the tomb?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and looking up, they see that the stone is rolled back: for it was exceeding great.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, arrayed in a white robe; and they were amazed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And he saith unto them, Be not amazed: ye seek Jesus, the Nazarene, which hath been crucified: he is risen; he is not here: behold, the place where they laid him!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But go, tell his disciples and Peter, He goeth before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him, as he said unto you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And they went out, and fled from the tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them: and they said nothing to any one; for they were afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Now when he was risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven devils.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">She went and told them that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And they, when they heard that he was alive, and had been seen of her, disbelieved.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And after these things he was manifested in another form unto two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And they went away and told it unto the rest: neither believed they them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And afterward he was manifested unto the eleven themselves as they sat at meat; and he upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to the whole creation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that disbelieveth shall be condemned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And these signs shall follow them that believe: in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">they shall take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall in no wise hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken unto them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And they went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen.</p>
