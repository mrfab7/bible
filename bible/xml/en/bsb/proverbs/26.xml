  <verse number="2">Like a fluttering sparrow or darting swallow, an undeserved curse does not come to rest.</verse>
  <verse number="3">A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the backs of fools!</verse>

  <verse number="5">Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he become wise in his own eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Like cutting off one’s own feet or drinking violence is the sending of a message by the hand of a fool.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Like lame legs hanging limp is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Like binding a stone into a sling is the giving of honor to a fool.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Like a thorn that goes into the hand of a drunkard is a proverb in the mouth of a fool.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Like an archer who wounds at random is he who hires a fool or passerby.</verse>
  <verse number="11">As a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool repeats his folly.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The slacker says, “A lion is in the road! A fierce lion roams the public square!”</verse>

  <verse number="19">so is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, “I was only joking!”</verse>
  <verse number="20">Without wood, a fire goes out; without gossip, a conflict ceases.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Like charcoal for embers and wood for fire, so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife.</verse>

  <verse number="23">Like glaze covering an earthen vessel are burning lips and a wicked heart.</verse>
  <verse number="24">A hateful man disguises himself with his speech, but he lays up deceit in his heart.</verse>
  <verse number="25">When he speaks graciously, do not believe him, for seven abominations fill his heart.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Though his hatred is concealed by deception, his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly.</verse>
  <verse number="27">He who digs a pit will fall into it, and he who rolls a stone will have it roll back on him.</verse>
  <verse number="28">A lying tongue hates those it crushes, and a flattering mouth causes ruin.</verse>
