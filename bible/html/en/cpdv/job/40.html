<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And the Lord continued, and he said to Job:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Will he who contends with God be so easily silenced? Certainly, he who argues with God must also respond to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then Job answered the Lord, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">What could I possibly answer, since I have been speaking thoughtlessly? I will place my hand over my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">One thing I have spoken, which I wish I had not said; and another, to which I will add no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But the Lord, answering Job out of the whirlwind, said:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Gird your waist like a man. I will question you, and you must answer me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Will you make my judgment null and void; and will you condemn me so that you may be justified?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And do you have an arm like God, or a voice like thunder?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Envelop yourself with splendor, and raise yourself up on high, and be glorious, and put on splendid garments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Scatter the arrogant with your wrath, and, when you see all the arrogant, humble them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Look down upon each of the arrogant and confound them, and crush the impious in their place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hide them in the dust together and plunge their faces into the pit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then I will confess that your right hand is able to save you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Behold, the behemoth, whom I created along with you, eats hay like an ox.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">His strength is in his lower back, and his power is in the center of his abdomen.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He draws up his tail like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs have been drawn together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">His bones are like pipes of brass; his cartilage is like plates of iron.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">He is the beginning of the ways of God, who made him; he will use him as his sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The mountains bring forth grass for him; all the beasts of the field will play there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He sleeps in the shadows, under the cover of branches, and in moist places.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The shadows cover his shadow; the willows of the brook will encircle him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Behold, he will drink a river and not be amazed, and he has confidence that the Jordan could flow into his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He will seize him through his eyes, as if with a hook, and he will bore through his nostrils, as if with stakes.</p>
