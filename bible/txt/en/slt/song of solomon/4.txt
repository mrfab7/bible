1	Behold thee beautiful, my friend, behold thee beautiful; thine eyes doves from behind to thy veil: thy hair as a herd of goats which lay down from mount Gilead.
2	Thy teeth as a herd of the shorn which came up from the washing; all of them bearing twins, and none barren among them.
3	As a scarlet thread thy lips, and thy speech becoming: as a piece of pomegranate, thy temples from behind thy veil.
4	As the tower of David thy neck, built for the weapons; a thousand shields hung upon it, all shields of the powerful.
5	Thy two breasts as two fawns, twins of the roe deer feeding among the lilies.
6	Till the day shall breathe, and the shadows fled away, I will go for myself to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of Lebanon.
7	All of thee beautiful, my friend, and no blemish in thee.
8	Thou shalt come with me from Lebanon, O bride, with me from Lebanon: thou shalt go round about from the head of faith, from the head of Shenir and Hermon, from the dwellings of lions, from the mountains of panthers.
9	Thou didst rob me of the heart, my sister, O bride; thou didst rob me of the heart with one of thine eyes, with one necklace of thy neck.
10	How beautiful were thy breasts, my sister, O bride! how good were thy breasts above wine, and the odor of thine ointments above all spices.
11	Thy lips will drop honey droppings, O bride: honey and milk under thy tongue, and the odor of thy garments as the odor of Lebanon.
12	A garden shut up, my sister, O bride; a reservoir shut up, a fountain sealed.
13	Thy sendings forth a park of pomegranates, with most precious fruits, cypresses with spikenards,
14	Spikenard and saffron; the reed and cinnamon, with all the woods of Lebanon; myrrh and aloes, with all the heads of spices.
15	A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters and flowings from Lebanon.
16	Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south, blow upon my garden; its spices shall flow out. My beloved shall come to his garden, and he shall eat his most precious fruits.
