<div class="chapter" data-book="Ecclesiastes" data-chapter="4" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Again I looked, and I considered all the oppression taking place under the sun. I saw the tears of the oppressed, and they had no comforter; the power lay in the hands of their oppressors, and there was no comforter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">So I admired the dead, who had already died, above the living, who are still alive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But better than both is he who has not yet existed, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">I saw that all labor and success spring from a man’s envy of his neighbor. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The fool folds his hands and consumes his own flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Better one handful with tranquility than two handfuls with toil and pursuit of the wind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Again, I saw futility under the sun.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">There is a man all alone, without even a son or brother. And though there is no end to his labor, his eyes are still not content with his wealth: “For whom do I toil and bereave my soul of enjoyment?” This too is futile—a miserable task.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For if one falls down, his companion can lift him up; but pity the one who falls without another to help him up!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Again, if two lie down together, they will keep warm; but how can one keep warm alone?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And though one may be overpowered, two can resist. Moreover, a cord of three strands is not quickly broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Better is a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to take a warning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For the youth has come from the prison to the kingship, though he was born poor in his own kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">I saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed this second one, the youth who succeeded the king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">There is no limit to all the people who were before them. Yet the successor will not be celebrated by those who come even later. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.</p>
