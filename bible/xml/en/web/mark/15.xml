  <verse number="1">Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” He answered, “So you say.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">The chief priests accused him of many things.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Pilate again asked him, “Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!”</verse>
  <verse number="5">But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">There was one called Barabbas, bound with those who had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”</verse>
  <verse number="10">For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Pilate again asked them, “What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?”</verse>
  <verse number="13">They cried out again, “Crucify him!”</verse>
  <verse number="14">Pilate said to them, “Why, what evil has he done?” But they cried out exceedingly, “Crucify him!”</verse>
  <verse number="15">Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and handed over Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort.</verse>
  <verse number="17">They clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">They began to salute him, “Hail, King of the Jews!”</verse>
  <verse number="19">They struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.</verse>
  <verse number="20">When they had mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross.</verse>
  <verse number="22">They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, “The place of a skull.”</verse>
  <verse number="23">They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn’t take it.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.</verse>
  <verse number="25">It was the third hour, and they crucified him.</verse>
  <verse number="26">The superscription of his accusation was written over him, “THE KING OF THE JEWS.”</verse>
  <verse number="27">With him they crucified two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The Scripture was fulfilled, which says, “He was numbered with transgressors.”</verse>
  <verse number="29">Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, “Ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,</verse>
  <verse number="30">save yourself, and come down from the cross!”</verse>
  <verse number="31">Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, “He saved others. He can’t save himself.</verse>
  <verse number="32">Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him.” Those who were crucified with him insulted him.</verse>
  <verse number="33">When the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
  <verse number="34">At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?” which is, being interpreted, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</verse>
  <verse number="35">Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.”</verse>
  <verse number="36">One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Let him be. Let’s see whether Elijah comes to take him down.”</verse>
  <verse number="37">Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="38">The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.</verse>
  <verse number="39">When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”</verse>
  <verse number="40">There were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</verse>
  <verse number="41">who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="42">When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation Day, that is, the day before the Sabbath,</verse>
  <verse number="43">Joseph of Arimathaea, a prominent council member who also himself was looking for the Kingdom of God, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus’ body.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Pilate marveled if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead long.</verse>
  <verse number="45">When he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.</verse>
  <verse number="46">He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</verse>
  <verse number="47">Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.</verse>
