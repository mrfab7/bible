<div class="chapter" data-book="Titus" data-chapter="3" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Remind them to be in subjection to rulers and to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">to speak evil of no one, not to be contentious, to be gentle, showing all humility toward all men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For we were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love toward mankind appeared,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">not by works of righteousness, which we did ourselves, but according to his mercy, he saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing by the Holy Spirit,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">whom he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Savior;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">that, being justified by his grace, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">This saying is faithful, and concerning these things I desire that you affirm confidently, so that those who have believed God may be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable to men;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">but shun foolish questionings, genealogies, strife, and disputes about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Avoid a factious man after a first and second warning;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">knowing that such a one is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When I send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Send Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos on their journey speedily, that nothing may be lacking for them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Let our people also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>
