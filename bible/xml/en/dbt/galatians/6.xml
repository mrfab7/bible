  <verse number="1">Brethren, if even a man be taken in some fault, ye who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, considering thyself lest thou also be tempted.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Bear one another’s burdens, and thus fulfil the law of the Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For if any man reputes himself to be something, being nothing, he deceives himself;</verse>
  <verse number="4">but let each prove his own work, and then he will have his boast in what belongs to himself alone, and not in what belongs to another.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For each shall bear his own burden.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teaches in all good things.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Be not deceived: God is not mocked; for whatever a man shall sow, that also shall he reap.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For he that sows to his own flesh, shall reap corruption from the flesh; but he that sows to the Spirit, from the Spirit shall reap eternal life:</verse>
  <verse number="9">but let us not lose heart in doing good; for in due time, if we do not faint, we shall reap.</verse>
  <verse number="10">So then, as we have occasion, let us do good towards all, and specially towards those of the household of faith.</verse>
  <verse number="11">See how long a letter I have written to you with my own hand.</verse>
  <verse number="12">As many as desire to have a fair appearance in [the] flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, only that they may not be persecuted because of the cross of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For neither do they that are circumcised themselves keep the law; but they wish you to be circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But far be it from me to boast save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom [the] world is crucified to me, and I to the world.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For [in Christ Jesus] neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision; but new creation.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace upon them and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For the rest let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the brands of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [be] with your spirit, brethren. Amen.</verse>
