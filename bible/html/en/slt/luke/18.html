<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And he spake to them a parable, that they must always pray, and not lose courage;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Saying, There was a certain judge in a certain city, fearing not God, and not occupied about man:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And a widow was in that city; and she came to him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he would not for a time: and after these he said in himself, And if I fear not God, and am not occupied about man;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Yet because this widow produces fatigue to me, I will avenge her, lest in the end, coming, she give me a blow under the eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the Lord said, Hear ye what the judge of injustice says.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And shall not God do the avenging of his chosen, crying to him day and night, being slow to anger toward them?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I say to you, that he will do their avenging swiftly. But the Son of man having come, shall he find faith upon earth</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And he spake to certain trusting upon themselves that they were just, and setting at nought the rest, this parable:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Two men went up to the temple to pray; one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The Pharisee having stood, prayed these to himself, O God, I return thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious, unjust, adulterers, or also as this publican.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I fast twice of the Sabbath; I pay tithes of all I possess.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the publican, standing afar off, would not either lift up the eyes to heaven, but struck upon his breast, saying, God propitiate for me the sinful.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I say to you, this one went down to his house justified rather than that one: for every one lifting up himself shall be humbled; and he humbling himself shall be lifted up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And they also brought babes to him, that he might touch them: and the disciples having seen, censured them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And Jesus having called them, said, Leave the young children to come to me, and hinder them not: for of such is time kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Truly I say to you, Whoever should not receive the kingdom of God as a young child should not enter into it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, having done what, shall I inherit eternal life?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And Jesus said to him, Why sayest thou me good? none good except the one God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Thou knowest the commands, Thou shouldest not commit adultery, Thou shouldest not kill, Thou shouldest not steal, Thou shouldest not bear false testimony, Honour thy father and thy mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And he said, All these have I watched from my youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Jesus having heard these, said to him, Yet one thing fails thee: all whatever thou hast, sell and distribute to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And he having heard these things, was sorely grieved: for he was very rich.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Jesus having seen him being sorely grieved, said, With how much difficulty shall they having possessions come into the kingdom of God!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For it is easier for a camel to come through the hole of a needle, than for a rich one to come into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And they having heard, said, And who can be saved?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And he said, The things impossible with men, are possible with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And Peter said, Behold, we have left all, and followed thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And he said to them, Truly I say to you, That there is none who has left home, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for sake of the kingdom of God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Who should not receive many fold in this time, and in life coming, eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And taking the twelve, he said to them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things written by the prophets shall be completed to the Son of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For he shall be delivered to the nations, and be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And having scourged, they shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And they understood nothing of these things: and this word was hidden from them, and they discerned not the things spoken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And it was in his drawing near to Jericho, a certain blind sat by the way, begging:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And having heard the multitude passing by, he inquired what this might be.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And they announced to him, That Jesus the Nazarite passes by.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And he cried out, saying, Jesus, son of David, pity me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And they going before censured him, that he be silent: and he so much the more cried out, O son of David, pity me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And Jesus having stood, commanded him to be brought to him: and he having drawn near, he asked him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Saying, What wilt thou I shall do to thee? And he said, Lord, that I might see again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And Jesus said to him, See again: thy faith has saved thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And he immediately saw again, and followed him, honouring God: and all the people having seen, gave praise to God.</p>
