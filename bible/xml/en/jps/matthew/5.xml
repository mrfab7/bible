  <verse number="1">Seeing the multitude of people, Jesus went up the Hill. There He seated Himself, and when His disciples came to Him,</verse>
  <verse number="2">He proceeded to teach them, and said:</verse>
  <verse number="3">“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for to them belongs the Kingdom of the Heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="4">“Blessed are the mourners, for they shall be comforted.</verse>
  <verse number="5">“Blessed are the meek, for they as heirs shall obtain possession of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="6">“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be completely satisfied.</verse>
  <verse number="7">“Blessed are the compassionate, for they shall receive compassion.</verse>
  <verse number="8">“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</verse>
  <verse number="9">“Blessed are the peacemakers, for it is they who will be recognized as sons of God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">“Blessed are those who have borne persecution in the cause of Righteousness, for to them belongs the Kingdom of the Heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="11">“Blessed are you when they have insulted and persecuted you, and have said every cruel thing about you falsely for my sake.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Be joyful and triumphant, because your reward is great in the Heavens; for so were the Prophets before you persecuted.</verse>
  <verse number="13">“*You* are the salt of the earth; but if salt has become tasteless, in what way can it regain its saltness? It is no longer good for anything but to be thrown away and trodden on by the passers by.</verse>
  <verse number="14">*You* are the light of the world; a town cannot be hid if built on a hill-top.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Nor is a lamp lighted to be put under a bushel, but on the lampstand; and then it gives light to all in the house.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Just so let your light shine before all men, in order that they may see your holy lives and may give glory to your Father who is in Heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="17">“Do not for a moment suppose that I have come to abrogate the Law or the Prophets: I have not come to abrogate them but to give them their completion.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Solemnly I tell you that until Heaven and earth pass away, not one iota or smallest detail will pass away from the Law until all has taken place.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Whoever therefore breaks one of these least commandments and teaches others to break them, will be called the least in the Kingdom of the Heavens; but whoever practises them and teaches them, he will be acknowledged as great in the Kingdom of the Heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For I assure you that unless your righteousness greatly surpasses that of the Scribes and the Pharisees, you will certainly not find entrance into the Kingdom of the Heavens.</verse>
  <verse number="21">“You have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘Thou shalt not commit murder’, and whoever commits murder will be answerable to the magistrate.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But I say to you that every one who becomes angry with his brother shall be answerable to the magistrate; that whoever says to his brother ‘Raca,’ shall be answerable to the Sanhedrin; and that whoever says, ‘You fool!’ shall be liable to the Gehenna of Fire.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If therefore when you are offering your gift upon the altar, you remember that your brother has a grievance against you,</verse>
  <verse number="24">leave your gift there before the altar, and go and make friends with your brother first, and then return and proceed to offer your gift.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Come to terms without delay with your opponent while you are yet with him on the way to the court; for fear he should obtain judgement from the magistrate against you, and the magistrate should give you in custody to the officer and you be thrown into prison.</verse>
  <verse number="26">I solemnly tell you that you will certainly not be released till you have paid the very last farthing.</verse>
  <verse number="27">“You have heard that it was said, ‘Thou shalt not commit adultery.’</verse>
  <verse number="28">But I tell you that whoever looks at a woman and cherishes lustful thoughts has already in his heart become guilty with regard to her.</verse>
  <verse number="29">If therefore your eye, even the right eye, is a snare to you, tear it out and away with it; it is better for you that one member should be destroyed rather than that your whole body should be thrown into Gehenna.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And if your right hand is a snare to you, cut it off and away with it; it is better for you that one member should be destroyed rather than that your whole body should go into Gehenna.</verse>
  <verse number="31">“It was also said, ‘If any man puts away his wife, let him give her a written notice of divorce.’</verse>
  <verse number="32">But I tell you that every man who puts away his wife except on the ground of unfaithfulness causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries her when so divorced commits adultery.</verse>
  <verse number="33">“Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘Thou shalt not swear falsely, but shalt perform thy vows to the Lord.’</verse>
  <verse number="34">But I tell you not to swear at all; neither by Heaven, for it is God’s throne;</verse>
  <verse number="35">nor by the earth, for it is the footstool under His feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the City of the Great King.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.</verse>
  <verse number="37">But let your language be, ‘Yes, yes,’ or ‘No, no.’ Anything in excess of this comes from the Evil one.</verse>
  <verse number="38">“You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, tooth for tooth.’</verse>
  <verse number="39">But I tell you not to resist a wicked man, but if any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other to him as well.</verse>
  <verse number="40">If any one wishes to go to law with you and to deprive you of your under garment, let him take your outer one also.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And whoever shall compel you to convey his goods one mile, go with him two.</verse>
  <verse number="42">To him who asks, give: from him who would borrow, turn not away.</verse>
  <verse number="43">“You have heard that it was said, ‘Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy.’</verse>
  <verse number="44">But I command you all, love your enemies, and pray for your persecutors;</verse>
  <verse number="45">that so you may become true sons of your Father in Heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the wicked as well as the good, and sends rain upon those who do right and those who do wrong.</verse>
  <verse number="46">For if you love only those who love you, what reward have you earned? Do not even the tax-gatherers do that?</verse>
  <verse number="47">And if you salute only your near relatives, what praise is due to you? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?</verse>
  <verse number="48">You however are to be complete in goodness, as your Heavenly Father is complete.</verse>
