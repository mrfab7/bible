<chapter book="Job" number="19" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But Job answered by saying:</verse>
  <verse number="2">How long will you afflict my soul and wear me down with words?</verse>
  <verse number="3">So, ten times you confound me and are not ashamed to oppress me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Now, of course, if I have been ignorant, my ignorance will be with me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But you have risen up against me, and you accuse me to my disgrace.</verse>
  <verse number="6">At least now you should understand that God has not afflicted me with a balanced judgment, though he has encompassed me with his scourges.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Behold, I will cry out, enduring violence, and no one will hear. I will announce loudly, but there is no one who may judge.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He has hemmed in my path, and I cannot pass; he has added darkness to my difficult path.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He has plundered me of my glory, and he has stolen the crown from my head.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He has destroyed me on every side, and I am lost, and, like an uprooted tree, he has taken away my hope.</verse>
  <verse number="11">His fury has raged against me, and in this way he has treated me like his enemy.</verse>
  <verse number="12">His troops have gathered together, and they have made their way to me, and they have besieged my tabernacle all around.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He has put my brothers far from me, and my friends have withdrawn from me like strangers.</verse>
  <verse number="14">My kinsmen have forsaken me, and those who knew me, have forgotten me.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The inhabitants of my house and my maidservants treat me just as if I were a stranger, and I have been like an sojourner in their eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I called my servant, and he did not respond; I pleaded with him with my own mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">My wife has shuddered at my breath, and I have begged the sons of my loins.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Even the foolish have looked down on me, and, when I withdrew from them, they spoke ill of me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Those who were sometime my counselors, treat me like an abomination; and he whom I valued the most has turned against me.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Since my flesh has been consumed, my bone adheres to my skin, and only my lips have been left around my teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Have mercy on me, have compassion on me, at least you my friends, because the hand of the Lord has touched me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Why do you pursue me just as God does, and satiate yourselves with my flesh?</verse>
  <verse number="23">Who will grant to me that my words may be written down? Who will grant to me that they may be inscribed in a book,</verse>
  <verse number="24">with an iron pen and a plate of lead, or else be carved in stone?</verse>
  <verse number="25">For I know that my Redeemer lives, and on the last day I will rise out of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And I will be enveloped again with my skin, and in my flesh I will see my God.</verse>
  <verse number="27">It is he whom I myself will see, and he whom my eyes will behold, and no other. This, my hope, has taken rest in my bosom.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Why then do you now say: “Let us pursue him, and let us find a basis to speak against him?”</verse>
  <verse number="29">So then, flee from the face of the sword, for the sword is the avenger of iniquities; but know this: there is to be a judgment.</verse>
