<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelled in the south, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And Israel vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the LORD listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loathes this light bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against you; pray to the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the LORD said to Moses, Make you a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looks on it, shall live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it on a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sun rise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">From there they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">From there they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Why it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And at the stream of the brooks that goes down to the dwelling of Ar, and lies on the border of Moab.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And from there they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the LORD spoke to Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing you to it:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The princes dig the well, the nobles of the people dig it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks toward Jeshimon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Let me pass through your land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the kingâ€™s high way, until we be past your borders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon to Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Why they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it has consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Woe to you, Moab! you are undone, O people of Chemosh: he has given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even to Dibon, and we have laid them waste even to Nophah, which reaches to Medeba.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Thus Israel dwelled in the land of the Amorites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And the LORD said to Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into your hand, and all his people, and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelled at Heshbon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.</p>
