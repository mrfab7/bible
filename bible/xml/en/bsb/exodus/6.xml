  <verse number="1">But the LORD said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh, for because of My mighty hand he will let the people go; because of My strong hand he will drive them out of his land.”</verse>
  <verse number="2">God also told Moses, “I am the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty, but by My name the LORD I did not make Myself known to them.</verse>
  <verse number="4">I also established My covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land where they lived as foreigners.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Furthermore, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered My covenant.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Therefore tell the Israelites: ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians and deliver you from their bondage. I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I will take you as My own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God, who brought you out from under the yoke of the Egyptians.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And I will bring you into the land that I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD!’”</verse>
  <verse number="9">Moses relayed this message to the Israelites, but on account of their broken spirit and cruel bondage, they did not listen to him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">So the LORD said to Moses,</verse>
  <verse number="11">“Go and tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go out of his land.”</verse>
  <verse number="12">But in the LORD’s presence Moses replied, “If the Israelites will not listen to me, then why would Pharaoh listen to me, since I am unskilled in speech?”</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them a charge concerning both the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="14">These were the heads of their fathers’ houses: The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, were Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi. These were the clans of Reuben.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon.</verse>

  <verse number="17">The sons of Gershon were Libni and Shimei, by their clans.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Kohath lived 133 years.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of the Levites according to their records.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed, and she bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived 137 years.</verse>

  <verse number="25">Aaron’s son Eleazar married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she bore him Phinehas. These were the heads of the Levite families by their clans.</verse>
  <verse number="26">It was this Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, “Bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by their divisions.”</verse>
  <verse number="27">Moses and Aaron were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt in order to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Now on the day that the LORD spoke to Moses in Egypt,</verse>
  <verse number="29">He said to him, “I am the LORD; tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything I say to you.”</verse>
  <verse number="30">But in the LORD’s presence Moses replied, “Since I am unskilled in speech, why would Pharaoh listen to me?”</verse>
