  <verse number="1">But now thus said the LORD that created you, O Jacob, and he that formed you, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed you, I have called you by your name; you are mine.</verse>
  <verse number="2">When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow you: when you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle on you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For I am the LORD your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior: I gave Egypt for your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for you.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Since you were precious in my sight, you have been honorable, and I have loved you: therefore will I give men for you, and people for your life.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Fear not: for I am with you: I will bring your seed from the east, and gather you from the west;</verse>
  <verse number="6">I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth;</verse>
  <verse number="7">Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yes, I have made him.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that have ears.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people be assembled: who among them can declare this, and show us former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.</verse>
  <verse number="10">You are my witnesses, said the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that you may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no savior.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I have declared, and have saved, and I have showed, when there was no strange god among you: therefore you are my witnesses, said the LORD, that I am God.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Yes, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Thus said the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the ships.</verse>
  <verse number="15">I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your King.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Thus said the LORD, which makes a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty waters;</verse>
  <verse number="17">Which brings forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they are extinct, they are quenched as wick.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Remember you not the former things, neither consider the things of old.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth; shall you not know it? I will even make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The beast of the field shall honor me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.</verse>
  <verse number="21">This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.</verse>
  <verse number="22">But you have not called on me, O Jacob; but you have been weary of me, O Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="23">You have not brought me the small cattle of your burnt offerings; neither have you honored me with your sacrifices. I have not caused you to serve with an offering, nor wearied you with incense.</verse>
  <verse number="24">You have bought me no sweet cane with money, neither have you filled me with the fat of your sacrifices: but you have made me to serve with your sins, you have wearied me with your iniquities.</verse>
  <verse number="25">I, even I, am he that blots out your transgressions for my own sake, and will not remember your sins.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare you, that you may be justified.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Your first father has sinned, and your teachers have transgressed against me.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.</verse>
