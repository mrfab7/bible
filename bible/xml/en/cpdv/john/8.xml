  <verse number="1">But Jesus continued on to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And early in the morning, he went again to the temple; and all the people came to him. And sitting down, he taught them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Now the scribes and Pharisees brought forward a woman caught in adultery, and they stood her in front of them.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they said to him: “Teacher, this woman was just now caught in adultery.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such a one. Therefore, what do you say?”</verse>
  <verse number="6">But they were saying this to test him, so that they might be able to accuse him. Then Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And then, when they persevered in questioning him, he stood upright and said to them, “Let whoever is without sin among you be the first to cast a stone at her.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">And bending down again, he wrote on the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But upon hearing this, they went away, one by one, beginning with the eldest. And Jesus alone remained, with the woman standing in front of him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Then Jesus, raising himself up, said to her: “Woman, where are those who accused you? Has no one condemned you?”</verse>
  <verse number="11">And she said, “No one, Lord.” Then Jesus said: “Neither will I condemn you. Go, and now do not choose to sin anymore.”</verse>
  <verse number="12">Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying: “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me does not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">And so the Pharisees said to him, “You offer testimony about yourself; your testimony is not true.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">Jesus responded and said to them: “Even though I offer testimony about myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going.</verse>
  <verse number="15">You judge according to the flesh. I do not judge anyone.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And when I do judge, my judgment is true. For I am not alone, but it is I and he who sent me: the Father.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And it is written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I am one who offers testimony about myself, and the Father who sent me offers testimony about me.”</verse>
  <verse number="19">Therefore, they said to him, “Where is your Father?” Jesus answered: “You know neither me, nor my Father. If you did know me, perhaps you would know my Father also.”</verse>
  <verse number="20">Jesus spoke these words at the treasury, while teaching in the temple. And no one apprehended him, because his hour had not yet come.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Therefore, Jesus again spoke to them: “I am going, and you shall seek me. And you will die in your sin. Where I am going, you are not able to go.”</verse>
  <verse number="22">And so the Jews said, “Is he going to kill himself, for he said: ‘Where I am going, you are not able to go?’ ”</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he said to them: “You are from below. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore, I said to you, that you will die in your sins. For if you will not believe that I am, you will die in your sin.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">And so they said to him, “Who are you?” Jesus said to them: “The Beginning, who is also speaking to you.</verse>
  <verse number="26">I have much to say about you and to judge. But he who sent me is true. And what I have heard from him, this I speak within the world.”</verse>
  <verse number="27">And they did not realize that he was calling God his Father.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And so Jesus said to them: “When you will have lifted up the Son of man, then you shall realize that I am, and that I do nothing of myself, but just as the Father has taught me, so do I speak.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he who sent me is with me, and he has not abandoned me alone. For I always do what is pleasing to him.”</verse>
  <verse number="30">As he was speaking these things, many believed in him.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Therefore, Jesus said to those Jews who believed in him: “If you will abide in my word, you will truly be my disciples.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.”</verse>
  <verse number="33">They answered him: “We are the offspring of Abraham, and we have never been a slave to anyone. How can you say, ‘You shall be set free?’ ”</verse>
  <verse number="34">Jesus answered them: “Amen, amen, I say to you, that everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Now the slave does not abide in the house for eternity. Yet the Son does abide in eternity.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Therefore, if the Son has set you free, then you will truly be free.</verse>
  <verse number="37">I know that you are sons of Abraham. But you are seeking to kill me, because my word has not taken hold in you.</verse>
  <verse number="38">I speak what I have seen with my Father. And you do what you have seen with your father.”</verse>
  <verse number="39">They responded and said to him, “Abraham is our father.” Jesus said to them: “If you are the sons of Abraham, then do the works of Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="40">But now you are seeking to kill me, a man who has spoken the truth to you, which I have heard from God. This is not what Abraham did.</verse>
  <verse number="41">You do the works of your father.” Therefore, they said to him: “We were not born out of fornication. We have one father: God.”</verse>
  <verse number="42">Then Jesus said to them: “If God were your father, certainly you would love me. For I proceeded and came from God. For I did not come from myself, but he sent me.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Why do you not recognize my speech? It is because you are not able to hear my word.</verse>
  <verse number="44">You are of your father, the devil. And you will carry out the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning. And he did not stand in the truth, because the truth is not in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks it from his own self. For he is a liar, and the father of lies.</verse>
  <verse number="45">But if I speak the truth, you do not believe me.</verse>
  <verse number="46">Which of you can convict me of sin? If I speak the truth to you, why do you not believe me?</verse>
  <verse number="47">Whoever is of God, hears the words of God. For this reason, you do not hear them: because you are not of God.”</verse>
  <verse number="48">Therefore, the Jews responded and said to him, “Are we not correct in saying that you are a Samaritan, and that you have a demon?”</verse>
  <verse number="49">Jesus responded: “I do not have a demon. But I honor my Father, and you have dishonored me.</verse>
  <verse number="50">But I am not seeking my own glory. There is One who seeks and judges.</verse>
  <verse number="51">Amen, amen, I say to you, if anyone will have kept my word, he will not see death for eternity.”</verse>
  <verse number="52">Therefore, the Jews said: “Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham is dead, and the Prophets; and yet you say, ‘If anyone will have kept my word, he shall not taste death for eternity.’</verse>
  <verse number="53">Are you greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? And the prophets are dead. So who do you make yourself to be?”</verse>
  <verse number="54">Jesus responded: “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me. And you say about him that he is your God.</verse>
  <verse number="55">And yet you have not known him. But I know him. And if I were to say that I do not know him, then I would be like you, a liar. But I know him, and I keep his word.</verse>
  <verse number="56">Abraham, your father, rejoiced that he might see my day; he saw it and was glad.”</verse>
  <verse number="57">And so the Jews said to him, “You have not yet reached fifty years, and you have seen Abraham?”</verse>
  <verse number="58">Jesus said to them, “Amen, amen, I say to you, before Abraham was made, I am.”</verse>
  <verse number="59">Therefore, they took up stones to cast at him. But Jesus hid himself, and he departed from the temple.</verse>
