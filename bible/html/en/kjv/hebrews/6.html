<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And this will we do, if God permit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For [it is] impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put [him] to an open shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">But that which beareth thorns and briers [is] rejected, and [is] nigh unto cursing; whose end [is] to be burned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For God [is] not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he sware by himself,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation [is] to them an end of all strife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed [it] by an oath:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">That by two immutable things, in which [it was] impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Which [hope] we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Whither the forerunner is for us entered, [even] Jesus, made an high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.</p>
