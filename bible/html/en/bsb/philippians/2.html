<div class="chapter" data-book="Philippians" data-chapter="2" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Therefore if you have any encouragement in Christ, if any comfort from His love, if any fellowship with the Spirit, if any affection and compassion,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">then make my joy complete by being like-minded, having the same love, being united in spirit and purpose.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Do nothing out of selfish ambition or empty pride, but in humility consider others more important than yourselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Each of you should look not only to your own interests, but also to the interests of others.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider equality with God something to be grasped,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in human likeness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to death—even death on a cross.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Therefore God exalted Him to the highest place and gave Him the name above all names,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Therefore, my beloved, just as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence, but now even more in my absence, continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For it is God who works in you to will and to act on behalf of His good purpose.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Do everything without complaining or arguing,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and perverse generation, in which you shine as lights in the world</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">as you hold forth the word of life, in order that I may boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor in vain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with all of you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">So you too should be glad and rejoice with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be cheered when I learn how you are doing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">I have nobody else like him who will genuinely care for your needs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For all the others look after their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">But you know Timothy’s proven worth, that as a child with his father he has served with me to advance the gospel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">So I hope to send him as soon as I see what happens with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And I trust in the Lord that I myself will come soon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But I thought it necessary to send back to you Epaphroditus, my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, who is also your messenger and minister to my needs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For he has been longing for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He was sick indeed, nearly unto death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, to spare me sorrow upon sorrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you may rejoice, and I may be less anxious.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor men like him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">because he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to make up for your deficit of service to me.</p>
