<chapter book="Isaiah" number="23" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">The burden of Tyre. Howl, you ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Be still, you inhabitants of the isle; you whom the merchants of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Be you ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea has spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up virgins.</verse>
  <verse number="5">As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely pained at the report of Tyre.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Pass you over to Tarshish; howl, you inhabitants of the isle.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Who has taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honorable of the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="9">The LORD of hosts has purposed it, to stain the pride of all glory, and to bring into contempt all the honorable of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Pass through your land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish: there is no more strength.</verse>
  <verse number="11">He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms: the LORD has given a commandment against the merchant city, to destroy the strong holds thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he said, You shall no more rejoice, O you oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there also shall you have no rest.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness: they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces thereof; and he brought it to ruin.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Howl, you ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Take an harp, go about the city, you harlot that have been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that you may be remembered.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the LORD: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the LORD, to eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.</verse>
