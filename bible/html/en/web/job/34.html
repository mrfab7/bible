<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="34" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Moreover Elihu answered,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">“Hear my words, you wise men. Give ear to me, you who have knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the ear tries words, as the palate tastes food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Let us choose for us that which is right. Let us know among ourselves what is good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For Job has said, ‘I am righteous, God has taken away my right:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Notwithstanding my right I am considered a liar. My wound is incurable, though I am without disobedience.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">What man is like Job, who drinks scorn like water,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For he has said, ‘It profits a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">“Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness, from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the work of a man he will render to him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Yes surely, God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert justice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who put him in charge of the earth? or who has appointed him over the whole world?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If he set his heart on himself, If he gathered to himself his spirit and his breath,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">all flesh would perish together, and man would turn again to dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">“If now you have understanding, hear this. Listen to the voice of my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Shall even one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty?—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Who says to a king, ‘Vile!’ or to nobles, ‘Wicked!’?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Who doesn’t respect the persons of princes, nor respects the rich more than the poor; for they all are the work of his hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In a moment they die, even at midnight. The people are shaken and pass away. The mighty are taken away without a hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">“For his eyes are on the ways of a man. He sees all his goings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">There is no darkness, nor thick gloom, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For he doesn’t need to consider a man further, that he should go before God in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He breaks in pieces mighty men in ways past finding out, and sets others in their place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Therefore he takes knowledge of their works. He overturns them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He strikes them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">because they turned aside from following him, and wouldn’t pay attention to any of his ways,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him. He heard the cry of the afflicted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">When he gives quietness, who then can condemn? When he hides his face, who then can see him? Alike whether to a nation, or to a man,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">that the godless man may not reign, that there be no one to ensnare the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">“For has any said to God, ‘I am guilty, but I will not offend any more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Teach me that which I don’t see. If I have done iniquity, I will do it no more’?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it? For you must choose, and not I. Therefore speak what you know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Men of understanding will tell me, yes, every wise man who hears me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">‘Job speaks without knowledge. His words are without wisdom.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">I wish that Job were tried to the end, because of his answering like wicked men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">For he adds rebellion to his sin. He claps his hands among us, and multiplies his words against God.”</p>
