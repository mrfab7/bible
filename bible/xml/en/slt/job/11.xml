  <verse number="1">And Zophar the Naamathite will answer and say,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Shall not the multitude of words be answered? and shall a man of lips be justified?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Shall thy empty talks cause men to be silent? and wilt thou deride and none making ashamed?</verse>
  <verse number="4">And thou wilt say, My instruction is pure, and I was clean in thine eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And who Will give God speaking, and he will open his lips with thee?</verse>
  <verse number="6">And he shall announce to thee hidden things of wisdom, for they are the double for understanding. And know thou that God will set to thee from thine iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Searching shalt thou and God? Shalt thou find the Almighty even to completeness?</verse>
  <verse number="8">The heavens being high, what wilt thou do? Hades being deep, what wilt thou know?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Its measure long above the earth, and broad above the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If he shall pass on, and shut up, and gather together, who shall turn him back.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For he knew men of vanity, and he will see iniquity; and will he not understand?</verse>
  <verse number="12">And man being empty will be without heart: and man will be born a wild ass’s colt.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If thou preparedst thy heart, and didst spread thy hands towards him;</verse>
  <verse number="14">If iniquity in thy hand, remove it far off, and wickedness shall not dwell in thy tents.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For then thou shalt lift up thy face from spot; and thou wert firm, and thou shalt not fear:</verse>
  <verse number="16">For thou shalt forget toil, then shalt remember as waters they passed away.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And life shall rise above the noonday: thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And thou didst trust, for there is hope; and thou didst search out; thou shalt lie down confidently.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And thou shalt lie down and none terrifying; and many waited for thy face.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And the eyes of the unjust shall be consumed, and flight shall perish from them, and their hope a breathing out of the soul.</verse>
