<chapter book="Galatians" number="4" translation="English Revised Version" translationID="erv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a bondservant, though he is lord of all;</verse>
  <verse number="2">but is under guardians and stewards until the term appointed of the father.</verse>
  <verse number="3">So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the rudiments of the world:</verse>
  <verse number="4">but when the fulness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,</verse>
  <verse number="5">that he might redeem them which were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</verse>
  <verse number="7">So that thou art no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Howbeit at that time, not knowing God, ye were in bondage to them which by nature are no gods:</verse>
  <verse number="9">but now that ye have come to know God, or rather to be known of God, how turn ye back again to the weak and beggarly rudiments, whereunto ye desire to be in bondage over again?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Ye observe days, and months, and seasons, and years.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I am afraid of you, lest by any means I have bestowed labour upon you in vain.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I beseech you, brethren, be as I am, for I am as ye are. Ye did me no wrong:</verse>
  <verse number="13">but ye know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you the first time:</verse>
  <verse number="14">and that which was a temptation to you in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but ye received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Where then is that gratulation of yourselves? for I bear you witness, that, if possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.</verse>
  <verse number="16">So then am I become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</verse>
  <verse number="17">They zealously seek you in no good way; nay, they desire to shut you out, that ye may seek them.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But it is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times, and not only when I am present with you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you,</verse>
  <verse number="20">yea, I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I am perplexed about you.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</verse>
  <verse number="22">For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the freewoman.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Howbeit the son by the handmaid is born after the flesh; but the son by the freewoman is born through promise.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Which things contain an allegory: for these women are two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children unto bondage, which is Hagar.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Now this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to the Jerusalem that now is: for she is in bondage with her children.</verse>
  <verse number="26">But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; Break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: For more are the children of the desolate than of her which hath the husband.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise.</verse>
  <verse number="29">But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Howbeit what saith the scripture? Cast out the handmaid and her son: for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Wherefore, brethren, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the freewoman.</verse>
