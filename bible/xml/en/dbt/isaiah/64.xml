  <verse number="1">Oh, that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down,—that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,</verse>
  <verse number="2">—as fire kindleth brushwood, as the fire causeth water to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations might tremble at thy presence!</verse>
  <verse number="3">When thou didst terrible things [which] we looked not for, thou camest down, and the mountains flowed down at thy presence.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Never have [men] heard, nor perceived by the ear, nor hath eye seen a God beside thee, who acteth for him that waiteth for him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thou meetest him that rejoiceth to do righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: (behold, thou wast wroth, and we have sinned:) in those is perpetuity, and we shall be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And we are all become as an unclean [thing], and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all fade as a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, have carried us away;</verse>
  <verse number="7">and there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee; for thou hast hidden thy face from us, and hast caused us to melt away through our iniquities.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And now, Jehovah, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Be not wroth very sore, O Jehovah, neither remember iniquity for ever. Behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Thy holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burnt up with fire, and all our precious things are laid waste.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Wilt thou restrain thyself in presence of these things, Jehovah? Wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?</verse>
