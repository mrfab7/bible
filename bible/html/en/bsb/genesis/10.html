<p class="verse" data-verse="1">This is the account of Noah’s sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, who also had sons after the flood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, the Kittites, and the Rodanites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">From these, the maritime peoples separated into their territories, according to their languages, by clans within their nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. And the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Cush was the father of Nimrod, who began to be a mighty one on the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; so it is said, “Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before the LORD.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">His kingdom began in Babylon, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">From that land he went forth into Assyria, where he built Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir, Calah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">and Resen, which is between Nineveh and the great city of Calah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Mizraim was the father of the Ludites, the Anamites, the Lehabites, the Naphtuhites,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">the Pathrusites, the Casluhites (from whom the Philistines came), and the Caphtorites.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Canaan was the father of Sidon his firstborn, and of the Hittites,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Later the Canaanite clans were scattered,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">and the borders of Canaan extended from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and then toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">These are the sons of Ham according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And sons were also born to Shem, the older brother of Japheth; Shem was the forefather of all the sons of Eber.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Arphaxad was the father of Shelah, and Shelah was the father of Eber.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Two sons were born to Eber: One was named Peleg, because in his days the earth was divided, and his brother was named Joktan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Obal, Abimael, Sheba,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were sons of Joktan.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Their territory extended from Mesha to Sephar, in the eastern hill country.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">These are the sons of Shem, according to their clans, languages, lands, and nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">All these are the clans of Noah’s sons, according to their generations and nations. From these the nations of the earth spread out after the flood.</p>
