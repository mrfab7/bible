  <verse number="1">Now the LORD said unto Abram: ‘Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto the land that I will show thee.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and be thou a blessing.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And I will bless them that bless thee, and him that curseth thee will I curse; and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed.’</verse>
  <verse number="4">So Abram went, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him; and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the terebinth of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said: ‘Unto thy seed will I give this land’; and he builded there an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he removed from thence unto the mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Ai on the east; and he builded there an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the South.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was sore in the land.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife: ‘Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And it will come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they will say: This is his wife; and they will kill me, but thee they will keep alive.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister; that it may be well with me for thy sake, and that my soul may live because of thee.’</verse>
  <verse number="14">And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And the princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And he dealt well with Abram for her sake; and he had sheep, and oxen, and he-asses, and men-servants, and maid-servants, and she-asses, and camels.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram’s wife.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Pharaoh called Abram, and said: ‘What is this that thou hast done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Why saidst thou: She is my sister? so that I took her to be my wife; now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.’</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him; and they brought him on the way, and his wife, and all that he had.</verse>
