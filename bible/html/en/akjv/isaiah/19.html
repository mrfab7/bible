<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rides on a swift cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in the middle of it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they shall fight every one against his brother, and every one against his neighbor; city against city, and kingdom against kingdom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the middle thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, said the Lord, the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of defense shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags shall wither.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away, and be no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets on the waters shall languish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave networks, shall be confounded.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that make sluices and ponds for fish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say you to Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Where are they? where are your wise men? and let them tell you now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts has purposed on Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the stay of the tribes thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The LORD has mingled a perverse spirit in the middle thereof: and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunken man staggers in his vomit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or tail, branch or rush, may do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">In that day shall Egypt be like to women: and it shall be afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD of hosts, which he shakes over it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the land of Judah shall be a terror to Egypt, every one that makes mention thereof shall be afraid in himself, because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he has determined against it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall be called, The city of destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the middle of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And it shall be for a sign and for a witness to the LORD of hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry to the LORD because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a savior, and a great one, and he shall deliver them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall know the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and oblation; yes, they shall vow a vow to the LORD, and perform it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the LORD shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal it: and they shall return even to the LORD, and he shall be entreated of them, and shall heal them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with Assyria, even a blessing in the middle of the land:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Whom the LORD of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel my inheritance.</p>
