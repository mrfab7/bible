  <verse number="1">And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="2">What mean ye, that ye use this proverb in the land of Israel, saying: The fathers have eaten sour grapes, And the children’s teeth are set on edge?</verse>
  <verse number="3">As I live, saith the Lord GOD, ye shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Behold, all souls are Mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is Mine; the soul that sinneth, it shall die.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,</verse>
  <verse number="6">and hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour’s wife, neither hath come near to a woman in her impurity;</verse>
  <verse number="7">and hath not wronged any, but hath restored his pledge for a debt, hath taken nought by robbery, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment;</verse>
  <verse number="8">he that hath not given forth upon interest, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true justice between man and man,</verse>
  <verse number="9">hath walked in My statutes, and hath kept Mine ordinances, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth to a brother any of these things,</verse>
  <verse number="11">whereas he himself had not done any of these things, for he hath even eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour’s wife,</verse>
  <verse number="12">hath wronged the poor and needy, hath taken by robbery, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination,</verse>
  <verse number="13">hath given forth upon interest, and hath taken increase; shall he then live? he shall not live—he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely be put to death, his blood shall be upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father’s sins, which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like,</verse>
  <verse number="15">that hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour’s wife,</verse>
  <verse number="16">neither hath wronged any, hath not taken aught to pledge, neither hath taken by robbery, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment,</verse>
  <verse number="17">that hath withdrawn his hand from the poor, that hath not received interest nor increase, hath executed Mine ordinances, hath walked in My statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live.</verse>
  <verse number="18">As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, committed robbery on his brother, and did that which is not good among his people, behold, he dieth for his iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Yet say ye: Why doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father with him? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all My statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The soul that sinneth, it shall die; the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father with him, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son with him; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But if the wicked turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all My statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</verse>
  <verse number="22">None of his transgressions that he hath committed shall be remembered against him; for his righteousness that he hath done he shall live.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD; and not rather that he should return from his ways, and live?</verse>
  <verse number="24">But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? None of his righteous deeds that he hath done shall be remembered; for his trespass that he trespassed, and for his sin that he hath sinned, for them shall he die.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Yet ye say: The way of the Lord is not equal. Hear now, O house of Israel: Is it My way that is not equal? is it not your ways that are unequal?</verse>
  <verse number="26">When the righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, he shall die therefor; for his iniquity that he hath done shall he die.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doeth that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Yet saith the house of Israel: The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, is it My ways that are not equal? is it not your ways that are unequal?</verse>
  <verse number="30">Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, saith the Lord GOD. Return ye, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so shall they not be a stumblingblock of iniquity unto you.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Cast away from you all your transgressions, wherein ye have transgressed; and make you a new heart and a new spirit; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?</verse>
  <verse number="32">For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD; wherefore turn yourselves, and live.</verse>
