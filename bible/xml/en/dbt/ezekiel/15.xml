  <verse number="1">And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Son of man, what is the wood of the vine more than any wood, the vine-branch, which is among the trees of the forest?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will [men] take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Behold, it is given to the fire for fuel: the fire consumeth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned; is it fit for [any] work?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Behold, when it was whole, it was used for no work; how much less when the fire hath consumed it, and it is burned, should it yet be used for any work?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: As the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And I will set my face against them: they shall go forth from [one] fire, and [another] fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I [am] Jehovah when I set my face against them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And I will make the land a desolation, because they have wrought unfaithfulness, saith the Lord Jehovah.</verse>
