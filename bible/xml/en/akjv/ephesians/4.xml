<chapter book="Ephesians" number="4" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation with which you are called,</verse>
  <verse number="2">With all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, forbearing one another in love;</verse>
  <verse number="3">Endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</verse>
  <verse number="4">There is one body, and one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling;</verse>
  <verse number="5">One Lord, one faith, one baptism,</verse>
  <verse number="6">One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But to every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.</verse>
  <verse number="9">(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?</verse>
  <verse number="10">He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)</verse>
  <verse number="11">And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;</verse>
  <verse number="12">For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="13">Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="14">That we from now on be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;</verse>
  <verse number="15">But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:</verse>
  <verse number="16">From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.</verse>
  <verse number="17">This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you from now on walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,</verse>
  <verse number="18">Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:</verse>
  <verse number="19">Who being past feeling have given themselves over to lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.</verse>
  <verse number="20">But you have not so learned Christ;</verse>
  <verse number="21">If so be that you have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:</verse>
  <verse number="22">That you put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;</verse>
  <verse number="23">And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;</verse>
  <verse number="24">And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Why putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbor: for we are members one of another.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Be you angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down on your wrath:</verse>
  <verse number="27">Neither give place to the devil.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needs.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace to the hearers.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby you are sealed to the day of redemption.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:</verse>
  <verse number="32">And be you kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ’s sake has forgiven you.</verse>
