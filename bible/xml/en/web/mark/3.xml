  <verse number="1">He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered.</verse>
  <verse number="2">They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">He said to the man who had his hand withered, “Stand up.”</verse>
  <verse number="4">He said to them, “Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?” But they were silent.</verse>
  <verse number="5">When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The Pharisees went out, and immediately conspired with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea,</verse>
  <verse number="8">from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He spoke to his disciples that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn’t press on him.</verse>
  <verse number="10">For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, “You are the Son of God!”</verse>
  <verse number="12">He sternly warned them that they should not make him known.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He went up into the mountain, and called to himself those whom he wanted, and they went to him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach,</verse>
  <verse number="15">and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:</verse>
  <verse number="16">Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;</verse>
  <verse number="17">James the son of Zebedee; John, the brother of James, and he surnamed them Boanerges, which means, Sons of Thunder;</verse>
  <verse number="18">Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;</verse>
  <verse number="19">and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. He came into a house.</verse>
  <verse number="20">The multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</verse>
  <verse number="21">When his friends heard it, they went out to seize him: for they said, “He is insane.”</verse>
  <verse number="22">The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, “He has Beelzebul,” and, “By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons.”</verse>
  <verse number="23">He summoned them, and said to them in parables, “How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
  <verse number="24">If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
  <verse number="25">If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</verse>
  <verse number="26">If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can’t stand, but has an end.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man; and then he will plunder his house.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Most certainly I tell you, all sins of the descendants of man will be forgiven, including their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme;</verse>
  <verse number="29">but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin”</verse>
  <verse number="30">—because they said, “He has an unclean spirit.”</verse>
  <verse number="31">His mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.</verse>
  <verse number="32">A multitude was sitting around him, and they told him, “Behold, your mother, your brothers, and your sisters are outside looking for you.”</verse>
  <verse number="33">He answered them, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”</verse>
  <verse number="34">Looking around at those who sat around him, he said, “Behold, my mother and my brothers!</verse>
  <verse number="35">For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother.”</verse>
