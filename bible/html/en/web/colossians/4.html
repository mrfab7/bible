<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Masters, give to your servants that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Continue steadfastly in prayer, watching therein with thanksgiving;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">praying together for us also, that God may open to us a door for the word, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">that I may reveal it as I ought to speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, redeeming the time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Let your speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All my affairs will be made known to you by Tychicus, the beloved brother, faithful servant, and fellow bondservant in the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I am sending him to you for this very purpose, that he may know your circumstances and comfort your hearts,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">together with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will make known to you everything that is going on here.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, greets you, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you received commandments, “if he comes to you, receive him”),</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and Jesus who is called Justus. These are my only fellow workers for the Kingdom of God who are of the circumcision, men who have been a comfort to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always striving for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For I testify about him, that he has great zeal for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for those in Hierapolis.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Greet the brothers who are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the assembly that is in his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">When this letter has been read among you, cause it to be read also in the assembly of the Laodiceans; and that you also read the letter from Laodicea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Tell Archippus, “Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The salutation of me, Paul, with my own hand: remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.</p>
