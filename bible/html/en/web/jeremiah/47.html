<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before that Pharaoh struck Gaza.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Thus says Yahweh: Behold, waters rise up out of the north, and shall become an overflowing stream, and shall overflow the land and all that is therein, the city and those who dwell therein; and the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall wail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong ones, at the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers donâ€™t look back to their children for feebleness of hands;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">because of the day that comes to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains: for Yahweh will destroy the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Caphtor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Baldness has come on Gaza; Ashkelon is brought to nothing, the remnant of their valley: how long will you cut yourself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">You sword of Yahweh, how long will it be before you be quiet? Put up yourself into your scabbard; rest, and be still.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">How can you be quiet, since Yahweh has given you a command? Against Ashkelon, and against the seashore, there has he appointed it.</p>
