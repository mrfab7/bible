<div class="chapter" data-book="Romans" data-chapter="7" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Know ye not brethren, (for I speak to them knowing law,) that law rules over man as much time as he lives?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For a married woman is bound by the law to a living husband; and if the husband die, she is left inactive from the law of the husband.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Wherefore, the husband living, she shall be called adulteress if she be to another man: but if the man die, she is free from the law; not to be an adulteress, being to another man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Therefore, my brethren, ye also were dead to the law by the body of Christ; for you not to be to another, but to him raised from the dead, that we bring forth fruit to God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For when we were in the flesh the passions of sins, those by the law, were energetic in our members to bring forth fruit to death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And now we were left inactive from the law, having died in what we were held; so that we serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">What then shall we say? The law sin? It may not be. But I knew not sin except by the law: for I knew not lust, if the law said not, Thou shalt not eagerly desire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And sin, having taken occasion by the command, wrought in me every lust. For without law sin dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And I was living without law once: and the command having come, sin came back to life, and I died.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And the command was found to me which for life, this for death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For sin having taken occasion by the command, deceived me completely, and by it killed me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Therefore truly the law holy, and the command holy, and just, and good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Was then good death to me? It may not be. But sin, that it might appear sin, by the good working death in me; that sin might be sinful to excess by the command.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For we know that the law is spiritual: and I am fleshly, sold under sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For what I work I know not: for what I would not, this I do; but what I hate, this I do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And if what I would not this I do, I consent to the law that it is good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And now I no more wish it, but sin dwelling in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For I know that in me dwells no good, (that is, in my flesh:) for to will lies near me; but to work good I find not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For not what good I would, do I; but the evil I would not, this I do.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And if what I would not, this I do, I no more work it, but sin dwelling in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">I find therefore a law to me, wishing to do good, that evil lies near me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For I rejoice in the law of God, according to the man within:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And I see another law in my members, fighting against the law of my mind, and taking me captive to the law of sin being in my members.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">I an oppressed man: who shall save me from the body of this death?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">I return thanks to God by Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore truly with the mind I serve the law of God; and with the flesh the law of sin.</p>
