<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Also at this my heart shall tremble, and it will leap from its place.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hearing, hear ye, to the noise of his voice, and the growling going out from his mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He will let it go free under all the heavens, and his light upon the wings of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">After him a voice shall rear; he will thunder with the voice of his majesty: and he will not leave them behind when his voice shall be heard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">God will thunder with his voice of wonder, doing great things, and we shall not know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For he will say to the snow, Be it on earth; and to the shower of rain, and to the shower of the rains of his strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He will seal in the hand of every man, for all men to know his work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And the beast shall go into the covert, and shall dwell in its habitation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">From the chamber shall come forth the whirlwind, and cold from the scatterings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">From the breath of God ice will be given, and the breadth of the waters in being straitened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Also by watering he will cast down the cloud: he will scatter the cloud of his light:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Being turned by his guidance to their doing all that he commanded them upon the face of the habitable globe of the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If for the rod, if for his land, if for mercy, it shall find him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Give ear to this, O Job: stand and consider the wonders of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Shalt thou know in Godâ€™s setting upon them, and he caused the light of his cloud to shine?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Shalt thou know upon the poisings of the cloud, the wonders of the complete of knowledges?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">That thy garments are warm in quieting the earth from the south?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Wilt thou spread out with him to the clouds, strong as the sight of a melted mass?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Make known to us what we shall say to him we shall not set in order from the face of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Shall it be recounted to him that I shall speak? If a man spake, then shall he be swallowed down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And now they saw not the bright light that is in the clouds: and the wind passed over and it will cleanse them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">From the north, gold shall come: upon God terrible majesty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The Almighty we found not: great of power and judgment, and much justice, he will not afflict.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For this, men shall fear him: he will not see all the wise of heart.</p>
