<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The burden of the valley of vision. What to thee now, that thou wentest up all of thee, to the roofs?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The city put in commotion was filled with noise, the exulting city: thy wounded not wounded of the sword, and not the dead of war.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">All thy chiefs fled together, they were bound of the bow: all they finding thee were bound together; they fled from from far off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For this I said, Look ye away from me; I will be bitter in my weeping, ye shall not hasten to comfort me upon the desolation of the daughter of my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For a day of consternation, and of treading down, and perplexity by the Lord Jehovah of armies of the valley of vision, of undermining the wall, and of a cry for help to the mountains.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Elam lifted up the quiver with the chariot of men, horsemen; and Kir made naked the shield.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And it shall be the chosen of thy valleys was filled with chariots, and the horsemen placed a seat at the gate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he will uncover the covering of Judah, and thou wilt look in that day to the weapons of the house of the forest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The clefts of the city of David ye saw, that they were many: and ye shall gather the water of the lowest pool.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The houses of Jerusalem ye numbered, and ye will break down the houses to fortify the wall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And ye made a gathering place between the two walls for the water of the old pool; and ye looked not to him making it, and ye saw not him forming it from far off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the Lord Jehovah of armies in that day will call to weeping and to wailing, and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And behold, gladness and joy, killing cattle and slaughtering sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: eat and drink, for to-morrow we shall die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And it was uncovered in the ears of Jehovah of armies, If this iniquity shall be expiated to you till ye shall die, said the Lord Jehovah of armies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Thus said the Lord Jehovah of armies, Go, come in to this associate to Shebna who is over the house,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">What to thee here, and who to thee here, that thou hewedst to thee here a tomb, he hewing from on high his tomb and cutting in a dwelling in a rock to himself?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Behold, Jehovah casting thee down, the casting down of a man, and covering, he covered thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Rolling, he will roll thee a roll as a ball into a land broad of hands: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy glory the dishonor of thy lord’s house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And I thrust thee from thy station, and from thy standing place he will pull thee down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And it was in that day I called for my servant, for Eliakim, son of Hilkiah:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And I will clothe him with thy tunic, and I will strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will give thy dominion into his hand, and he was for a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And I gave the key of the house of David upon his shoulder, and he opened and none shut, and he shut and none opened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And I fastened him a peg in a faithful place; and he was for a throne of glory to his father’s house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And they hung upon him all the glory of his father’s house, the offspring and the sprouts, all the vessels of smallness, from the vessels of lavers and even to all the vessels of flasks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">In that day, says Jehovah of armies, shall the peg fastened in a faithful place give way, and it was cut down, and it fell; and the lifting up which was upon it was cut off: for Jehovah spake.</p>
