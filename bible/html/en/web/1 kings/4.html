<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River to the land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt: they brought tribute, and served Solomon all the days of his life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour, and sixty measures of meal,</p>
