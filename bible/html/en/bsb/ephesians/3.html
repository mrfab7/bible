<p class="verse" data-verse="1">For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles...</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Surely you have heard about the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">that is, the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I have already written briefly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">In reading this, then, you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God’s holy apostles and prophets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">This mystery is that through the gospel the Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace, given me through the working of His power.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Though I am less than the least of all the saints, this grace was given me: to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">and to illuminate for everyone the stewardship of this mystery, which for ages past was kept hidden in God, who created all things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">His purpose was that now, through the church, the manifold wisdom of God should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">according to the eternal purpose that He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">In Him and through faith in Him we may enter God’s presence with boldness and confidence.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">So I ask you not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you, which are your glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">... for this reason I bow my knees before the Father,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">I ask that out of the riches of His glory He may strengthen you with power through His Spirit in your inner being,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. Then you, being rooted and grounded in love,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">will have power, together with all the saints, to comprehend the length and width and height and depth</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">of the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Now to Him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to His power that is at work within us,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.</p>
