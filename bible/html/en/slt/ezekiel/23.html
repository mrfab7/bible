<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The word of Jehovah will come to me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Son of man, there were two women, daughters of one mother:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they will commit fornication in Egypt; in their youth they committal fornication: there were their breasts pressed, and the breasts of their virginity fell away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And their names Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister; and they will be to me, and they will bring forth sons and daughters, and their names Shomeron-Aholah and Jerusalem Aholibah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Aholah will commit fornication under me; and she will desire after those loving her, after Assur, they being near.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Putting on cerulean purple, prefects and governors, young men of desire all of them, horsemen riding horses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And she will give her whoredoms upon them from the choice of the sons of Assur all of them, and with all whom she desired; being defiled with all their blocks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And her fornications from Egypt she forsook not: for they lay with her in her youth, and they handled the breasts of her virginity, and they will pour forth her fornications upon her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For this I delivered her into the hand of those loving her, into the hand of the sons of Assur whom she desired after them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">They uncovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters and slew them with the sword: and she will be a name to women, and they did judgments upon her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And her sister Aholibah will see, and she will corrupt her love more than they, and her fornications more than the fornication of her sister.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">She desired after the sons of Assur, prefects and governors, being near, putting on splendor, horsemen riding horses, young men of desire, all of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And I shall see that one way was defiled to both of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And she will add to her fornications: and she will see men delineated upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans being delineated with red color.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Girding girdles upon their loins, a superfluity of dippings upon their heads, the appearance of third men all of them, the likeness of the sons of Babel of Chaldea, the land of their birth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And she will desire after them at the sight of her eyes, and she will send messengers to them to Chaldea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And the sons of Babel will come to her to the bed of loves, and defile her with their fornications, and she will be defiled with them, and her soul will be rent away from them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And she will uncover her fornications, and she will uncover her nakedness: and my soul will be rent away from her, as my soul was rent away from her sister.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And she will multiply her fornications, to remember the days of her youth when she committed fornication in the land of Egypt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And she will desire after their paramours, whom the flesh of asses their flesh, and the flowing of horses their flowing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And thou wilt review the wickedness of thy youth in the doing of Egypt thy breasts for the breasts of thy youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">For this, O Aholibah, thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me raising up those loving thee, against thee, whom thy soul was rent away from them, and I brought them against thee from round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The sons of Babel and all the Chaldeans, Pekod and Shoa and Koa, all the sons of Amur with them: young men of desire, prefects and governors, all of them third men, and celebrated, riding horses all of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And they came against thee firm with chariot and wheel, and with a convocation of peoples, shield and buckler and helmet, they will set against thee round about: and I gave judgment before them, and they judged thee with their judgments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And I gave my jealousy against thee, and they did with thee in wrath: thy nose and thine ears they shall take away; and thy posterity shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters, and thy posterity shall be consumed in fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And they stripped thee of thy garments, and they took the instrument of thy glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And I caused thy wickedness to cease from thee, and thy fornication from the land of Egypt: and thou shalt not lift up thine eyes to them, and thou shalt remember Egypt no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Behold me giving thee into the hand of whom thou didst hate, into the hand of whom thy soul was rent away from them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And they did with thee in hatred, and they took all thy labor, and they left thee naked and nakedness: and the nakedness of thy fornication was uncovered, and thy wickedness and thy fornications.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Doing these to thee for thy fornications after the nations, because thou wert defiled with their blocks.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Thou wentest in the way of thy sister, and I gave her cup into thine hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Thus said the Lord Jehovah: thou shalt drink thy sisterâ€™s cup deep and much: thou shalt be for laughter and for derision; containing much.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and with sorrow, the cup of astonishment and desolation, the cup of thy sister Shomeron.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Thou didst drink it and suck out, and thou shalt crush its sherds, and pluck up thy breasts: for I spake, says the Lord Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">For this, thus says the Lord Jehovah: Because thou didst forget me, and thou wilt cast me behind thy back, and also bear thou thy wickedness and thy fornications.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And Jehovah will say to me, Son of man, wilt thou judge Aholah and Aholibah, and announce to them their abominations?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">For they committed adultery, and blood is in their hands; and with their blocks they committed adultery, and also their sons whom they brought forth to me they caused to pass through for them for consuming.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">Yet this they did to me: they defiled my holy place in that day, and my Sabbaths they profaned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And in their slaughtering their sons to their blocks, and they will come to my holy place in that day to profane it; and behold, thus they did in the midst of my house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And also that ye will send to men coming from far off, whom a messenger was sent to them, and behold, they came: for whom thou didst wash, thou paintedst thine eyes, and thou didst deck with ornaments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And thou wilt sit upon a splendid bed, and a table set in order before his face, and thou didst bring up there mine incense and mine oil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And the voice of a multitude at rest with her: and to the men of multitude of man bringing Sabeans from the desert, and they will give bracelets upon their hands, and crowns of glory upon their heads.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And saying to her worn out with adulteries, Will she now commit her fornications, she also?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And they will go in to her as going in to a woman an harlot; thus they went in to Aholah and to Aholibah, the women of wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">And just men they shall judge them with the judgment of adultresses, and with the judgment of those pouring out blood; for they are adultresses, and blood in their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">For thus said the Lord Jehovah: Bring up upon them a convocation and give them for a shaking and for a spoil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">And the convocation stoned upon them with stone, and cut them down with: their swords; they will slay their sons and their daughters, and their houses they will burn in fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">And I caused wickedness to cease from the land, and all the women were instructed, and they shall not do according to your wickedness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">And they gave your wickedness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your blocks: and ye knew that I am the Lord Jehovah.</p>
