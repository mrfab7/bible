<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Should your lies make men hold their peace? and when you mock, shall no man make you ashamed?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For you have said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in your eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against you;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And that he would show you the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacts of you less than your iniquity deserves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Can you by searching find out God? can you find out the Almighty to perfection?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">It is as high as heaven; what can you do? deeper than hell; what can you know?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For he knows vain men: he sees wickedness also; will he not then consider it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild assâ€™s colt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If you prepare your heart, and stretch out your hands toward him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If iniquity be in your hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in your tabernacles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">For then shall you lift up your face without spot; yes, you shall be steadfast, and shall not fear:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Because you shall forget your misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And your age shall be clearer than the noonday: you shall shine forth, you shall be as the morning.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And you shall be secure, because there is hope; yes, you shall dig about you, and you shall take your rest in safety.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Also you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid; yes, many shall make suit to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.</p>
