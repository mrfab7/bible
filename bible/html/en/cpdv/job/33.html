<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="33" data-translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" data-translation-id="cpdv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Therefore, hear my speeches, Job, and listen to all my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Behold, I have opened my mouth; let my tongue speak along with my throat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">My words are from my simple heart, and my lips will speak a pure judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The Spirit of God made me, and the breath of the Almighty gave me life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If you can, answer me, and oppose me to my face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Behold, God has made me, just as he also has made you, and I, likewise, have been formed of the same clay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">So, truly, do not let my wonders terrify you, and do not let my eloquence be burdensome to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For you have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of your words, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">“I am clean and without sin; I am immaculate, and there is no iniquity in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Yet he has discovered blame in me, and so he has treated me like his enemy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He has put my feet in fetters; he has kept watch over all my ways.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Therefore, it is for this reason that you have not been justified. For I tell you that God is greater than man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Do you contend against him because he has not responded to all of your words?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">God speaks once, and he does not repeat the same thing a second time.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Through a dream in a vision of the night, when a deep sleep falls over men, and they are sleeping in their beds,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">then, he opens the ears of men, and, educating them, he teaches discipline,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">so that he may divert a man from the things that he is doing, and may free him from pride,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">rescuing his soul from corruption and his life from passing away by the sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Likewise, he rebukes by sorrow in bed, and he causes all of his bones to become weak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Bread becomes abominable to him in his life, and, to his soul, the meat which before he desired.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">His body will waste away, and his bones, which had been covered, will be revealed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">His soul has approached corruption, and his life has drawn near to what is deadly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If there were an angel speaking for him, one among thousands, to declare the fairness of the man,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">he will have mercy on him, and he will say, “Free him, so that he will not descend to destruction. I have found a reason to be favorable to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">His body is consumed by suffering. Let him return to the days of his youth.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He will beg pardon from God, and he will be soothing to him; and he will look upon his face in jubilation, and he will restore his justice to man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He will consider mankind, and he will say: “I have sinned and truly I have offended, yet I was not treated as I deserved.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He has freed his soul from continuing into destruction, so that, in living, it may see the light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Behold, all these things God works three times within each one,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">so that he may revive their souls from corruption and enlighten them with the light of life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Pay attention Job, and listen to me; and remain silent, while I speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Yet, if you have anything to say, answer me and speak, for I want you to be treated justly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">But if you do not have anything to say, then listen to me. Be quiet and I will teach you wisdom.</p>
