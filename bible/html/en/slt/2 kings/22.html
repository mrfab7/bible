<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The son of eight years was Josiah in his reigning, and thirty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name Jedidah, daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And he will do the straight in the eyes of Jehovah, and go in all the way of David his father, and he turned not aside to the right or the left.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And it will be in the eighteenth year to king Josiah, the king sent Shaphen son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, the scribe of the house of Jehovah, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Go up to Hilkiah the great priest, and he shall complete the silver being brought to the house of Jehovah, which the watchers of the threshold gathered from the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And they shall give it into the hand of those appointed in the house of Jehovah: and they shall give it to those doing the work which is in the house of Jehovah to strengthen the breach of the house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">To the artificers, and to the builders and the wall builders, and to buy woods and stones hewn to strengthen the house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But the silver given into their hand will not be reckoned with them, for they do in faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Hilkiah the great priest will say to Shaphan the scribe, I found the book of the law in the house of Jehovah, and Hilkiah will give the book to Shaphan and he will read it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Shaphan the scribe will come to the king, and he will turn the king back word, and he will say, Thy servants melted the silver found in the house, and they will give it into the hand of those doing the work being appointed in the house of Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Shaphan the scribe will announce to the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest gave to me a book, and Shaphan will read it before the king.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And it will be when the king heard the words of the book of the law, and he will rend his garments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the king will command Hilkiah the priest and Ahikam son of Shaphan, and Achbor, son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah the king’s servant, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Go ye, seek Jehovah for me, and for the people, and for all Judah concerning the words of this book being found: for great the anger of Jehovah burning upon us because that our fathers heard not to the words of this book to do according to all written concerning us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Hilkiah the priest went, and Ahikam and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, to Huldah the prophetess wife of Shallum, son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, watching the garments; (and she dwelt in Jerusalem in the second rank;) and they will speak to her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And she will say to them, Thus said Jehovah God of Israel, Say ye to the man who sent you to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Thus said Jehovah, Behold me bringing evil to this place, and upon its inhabitants all the words of the book which the king of Judah read.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Because they forsook me, and they will burn incense to other gods to irritate me in all the work of their hands; and my wrath burnt upon this place and it shall not be quenched.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">To the king of Judah sending you to seek Jehovah, thus shalt thou say to him, Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, The words which thou heardest;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Because thy heart was tender and thou wilt be humble from before Jehovah in thy hearing what I spake against this place, and against its inhabitants to be for desolation, and for a curse, and thou wilt rend thy garments and weep before me; and I also heard, says Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For this, behold me gathering thee to thy fathers, and thou wert gathered to thy tomb in peace; and thine eyes shall not look upon all the evil which I bring upon this place. And they will turn back the king word.</p>
