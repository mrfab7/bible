<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Balances of deceit, an abomination of Jehovah: and a whole stone his delight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Pride coming, and dishonor will come: and wisdom with the humble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The integrity of the upright shall guide them: and the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Wealth will not profit in the day of wrath, and justice will deliver from death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">The justice of the blameless shall make straight his way, and in his injustice the unjust shall fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The justice of the upright shall deliver them, and transgressors shall be taken in their mischief.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">In the death of an unjust man expectation shall perish: and the hope of the vain shall perish.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The just one was delivered from straits, and the unjust will come in his stead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">With the mouth the profane will destroy his neighbor: and by knowledge, shall the just one be delivered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">In the good of the just the city will exult: and in the perishing of the unjust it rejoiced.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">By the blessing of the upright the city shall be exalted: and by the mouth of the unjust it shall be overthrown.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He wanting heart despised for his neighbor: and a man of understanding will be silent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He going about tale-bearing reveals a secret: and he being faithful of spirit hides the word.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">In no guidance the people will fall: and salvation in a multitude of counseling.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The evil one shall become evil, for he became surety for a stranger: and he hating those striking hands being secure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A woman of grace will obtain honor, and the powerful will obtain riches.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The man of mercy benefited his soul: and the cruel troubled his flesh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The unjust one did a work of falsehood: and the seed of justice the reward of truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">So justice to life, and he pursuing evil, to his death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The perverse of heart are an abomination of Jehovah, and the blameless of way his delight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Hand to hand, the evil one shall not be unpunished: and the seed of the just were delivered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A ring of gold in the nose of a swine, a fair woman and she departed from discernment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">The desire of the just is only good: the expectation of the unjust, wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">There is scattering and yet adding; and the withholding more than right, only to want.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The soul of blessing shall be made fat: also he watering, shall himself drink to the full.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He withholding grain, the people shall curse him: and blessing upon the head of him selling.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He seeking good shall strive after acceptance: and he seeking evil, it shall come to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">He trusting in his riches himself shall fall: and the just shall flourish as the foliage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">He troubling his house shall inherit wind: and the foolish is servant to the wise of heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">The fruit of the just a tree of life; and he taking souls is wise.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Behold, the just shall be requited in the earth: much more the unjust one and the sinning.</p>
