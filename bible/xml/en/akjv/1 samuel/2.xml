<chapter book="1 Samuel" number="2" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoices in the LORD, my horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over my enemies; because I rejoice in your salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="2">There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside you: neither is there any rock like our God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogance come out of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</verse>
  <verse number="4">The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled are girded with strength.</verse>
  <verse number="5">They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren has born seven; and she that has many children is waxed feeble.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The LORD kills, and makes alive: he brings down to the grave, and brings up.</verse>
  <verse number="7">The LORD makes poor, and makes rich: he brings low, and lifts up.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He raises up the poor out of the dust, and lifts up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD’s, and he has set the world on them.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven shall he thunder on them: the LORD shall judge the ends of the earth; and he shall give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did minister to the LORD before Eli the priest.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And the priest’s custom with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest’s servant came, while the flesh was in seething, with a meat hook of three teeth in his hand;</verse>
  <verse number="14">And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the meat hook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites that came thither.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Also before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant came, and said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of you, but raw.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And if any man said to him, Let them not fail to burn the fat presently, and then take as much as your soul desires; then he would answer him, No; but you shall give it me now: and if not, I will take it by force.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Why the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="18">But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give you seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the LORD. And they went to their own home.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did to all Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And he said to them, Why do you such things? for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people.</verse>
  <verse number="24">No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: you make the LORD’s people to transgress.</verse>
  <verse number="25">If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they listened not to the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favor both with the LORD, and also with men.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus said the LORD, Did I plainly appear to the house of your father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh’s house?</verse>
  <verse number="28">And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer on my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? and did I give to the house of your father all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?</verse>
  <verse number="29">Why kick you at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the most chief of all the offerings of Israel my people?</verse>
  <verse number="30">Why the LORD God of Israel said, I said indeed that your house, and the house of your father, should walk before me for ever: but now the LORD said, Be it far from me; for them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm of your father’s house, that there shall not be an old man in your house.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And you shall see an enemy in my habitation, in all the wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an old man in your house for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And the man of yours, whom I shall not cut off from my altar, shall be to consume your eyes, and to grieve your heart: and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower of their age.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And this shall be a sign to you, that shall come on your two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind: and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before my anointed for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="36">And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in your house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray you, into one of the priests’ offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.</verse>
