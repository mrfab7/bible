<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Eliu also proceeded, and said :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee : for I have yet somewhat to speak in Godâ€™s behalf.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">I will repeat my knowledge from the beginning, and I will prove my Maker just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For indeed my words are without a lie, and perfect knowledge shall be proved to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">God doth not cast away the mighty, whereas he himself also is mighty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But he saveth not the wicked, and he giveth judgment to the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He will not take away his eyes from the just, and he placeth kings on the throne for ever, and they are exalted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And if they shall be in chains, and be bound with the cords of poverty :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He shall shew them their works, and their wicked deeds, because they have been violent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He also shall open their ear, to correct them : and shall speak, that they may return from iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">If they shall hear and observe, they shall accomplish their days in good, and their years in glory.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But if they hear not, they shall pass by the sword, and shall be consumed in folly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Dissemblers and crafty men prove the wrath of God, neither shall they cry when they are bound.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Their soul shall die in a storm, and their life among the effeminate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He shall deliver the poor out of his distress, and shall open his ear in affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Therefore he shall set thee at large out of the narrow mouth, and which hath no foundation under it : and the rest of thy table shall be full of fatness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Thy cause hath been judged as that of the wicked, cause and judgment thou shalt recover.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Therefore let not anger overcome thee to oppress any man : neither let multitude of gifts turn thee aside.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Lay down thy greatness without tribulation, and all the mighty of strength.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Prolong not the night that people may come up for them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Beware thou turn not aside to iniquity : for this thou hast begun to follow after misery.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Behold, God is high in his strength, and none is like him among the lawgivers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Who can search out his ways? or who can say to him : Thou has wrought iniquity?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Remember that thou knowest not his work, concerning which men have sung.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">All men see him, every one beholdeth afar off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Behold, God is great, exceeding our knowledge : the number of his years is inestimable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He lifteth up the drops of rain, and poureth out showers like floods :</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Which flow from the clouds that cover all above.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">If he will spread out clouds as his tent,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And lighten with his light from above, he shall cover also the ends of the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For by these he judgeth people, and giveth food to many mortals.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">In his hands he hideth the light, and commandeth it to come again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">He sheweth his friend concerning it, that it is his possession, and that he may come up to it.</p>
