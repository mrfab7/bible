  <verse number="1">[There is] then now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and of death.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, having sent his own Son, in likeness of flesh of sin, and for sin, has condemned sin in the flesh,</verse>
  <verse number="4">in order that the righteous requirement of the law should be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh but according to Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For they that are according to flesh mind the things of the flesh; and they that are according to Spirit, the things of the Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For the mind of the flesh [is] death; but the mind of the Spirit life and peace.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Because the mind of the flesh is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God; for neither indeed can it be:</verse>
  <verse number="8">and they that are in flesh cannot please God.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But ye are not in flesh but in Spirit, if indeed God’s Spirit dwell in you; but if any one has not [the] Spirit of Christ he is not of him:</verse>
  <verse number="10">but if Christ be in you, the body is dead on account of sin, but the Spirit life on account of righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But if the Spirit of him that has raised up Jesus from among [the] dead dwell in you, he that has raised up Christ from among [the] dead shall quicken your mortal bodies also on account of his Spirit which dwells in you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to flesh;</verse>
  <verse number="13">for if ye live according to flesh, ye are about to die; but if, by the Spirit, ye put to death the deeds of the body, ye shall live:</verse>
  <verse number="14">for as many as are led by [the] Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For ye have not received a spirit of bondage again for fear, but ye have received a spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The Spirit itself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And if children, heirs also: heirs of God, and Christ’s joint heirs; if indeed we suffer with [him], that we may also be glorified with [him].</verse>
  <verse number="18">For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy [to be compared] with the coming glory to be revealed to us.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For the anxious looking out of the creature expects the revelation of the sons of God:</verse>
  <verse number="20">for the creature has been made subject to vanity, not of its will, but by reason of him who has subjected [the same], in hope</verse>
  <verse number="21">that the creature itself also shall be set free from the bondage of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For we know that the whole creation groans together and travails in pain together until now.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And not only [that], but even we ourselves, who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, we also ourselves groan in ourselves, awaiting adoption, [that is] the redemption of our body.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For we have been saved in hope; but hope seen is not hope; for what any one sees, why does he also hope?</verse>
  <verse number="25">But if what we see not we hope, we expect in patience.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And in like manner the Spirit joins also its help to our weakness; for we do not know what we should pray for as is fitting, but the Spirit itself makes intercession with groanings which cannot be uttered.</verse>
  <verse number="27">But he who searches the hearts knows what [is] the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for saints according to God.</verse>
  <verse number="28">But we do know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to purpose.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Because whom he has foreknown, he has also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of his Son, so that he should be [the] firstborn among many brethren.</verse>
  <verse number="30">But whom he has predestinated, these also he has called; and whom he has called, these also he has justified; but whom he has justified, these also he has glorified.</verse>
  <verse number="31">What shall we then say to these things? If God [be] for us, who against us?</verse>
  <verse number="32">He who, yea, has not spared his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also with him grant us all things?</verse>
  <verse number="33">Who shall bring an accusation against God’s elect? [It is] God who justifies:</verse>
  <verse number="34">who is he that condemns? [It is] Christ who has died, but rather has been [also] raised up; who is also at the right hand of God; who also intercedes for us.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? tribulation or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?</verse>
  <verse number="36">According as it is written, For thy sake we are put to death all the day long; we have been reckoned as sheep for slaughter.</verse>
  <verse number="37">But in all these things we more than conquer through him that has loved us.</verse>
  <verse number="38">For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,</verse>
  <verse number="39">nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which [is] in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
