  <verse number="1">And the feast of the unleavened food was coming nigh, that is called Passover,</verse>
  <verse number="2">and the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they may take him up, for they were afraid of the people.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And the Adversary entered into Judas, who is surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve,</verse>
  <verse number="4">and he, having gone away, spake with the chief priests and the magistrates, how he might deliver him up to them,</verse>
  <verse number="5">and they rejoiced, and covenanted to give him money,</verse>
  <verse number="6">and he agreed, and was seeking a favourable season to deliver him up to them without tumult.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And the day of the unleavened food came, in which it was behoving the passover to be sacrificed,</verse>
  <verse number="8">and he sent Peter and John, saying, ‘Having gone on, prepare to us the passover, that we may eat;’</verse>
  <verse number="9">and they said to him, ‘Where wilt thou that we might prepare?’</verse>
  <verse number="10">And he said to them, ‘Lo, in your entering into the city, there shall meet you a man, bearing a pitcher of water, follow him to the house where he doth go in,</verse>
  <verse number="11">and ye shall say to the master of the house, The Teacher saith to thee, Where is the guest-chamber where the passover with my disciples I may eat?</verse>
  <verse number="12">and he shall show you a large upper room furnished, there make ready;’</verse>
  <verse number="13">and they, having gone away, found as he hath said to them, and they made ready the passover.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And when the hour come, he reclined (at meat), and the twelve apostles with him,</verse>
  <verse number="15">and he said unto them, ‘With desire I did desire to eat this passover with you before my suffering,</verse>
  <verse number="16">for I say to you, that no more may I eat of it till it may be fulfilled in the reign of God.’</verse>
  <verse number="17">And having taken a cup, having given thanks, he said, ‘Take this and divide to yourselves,</verse>
  <verse number="18">for I say to you that I may not drink of the produce of the vine till the reign of God may come.’</verse>
  <verse number="19">And having taken bread, having given thanks, he brake and gave to them, saying, ‘This is my body, that for you is being given, this do ye—to remembrance of me.’</verse>
  <verse number="20">In like manner, also, the cup after the supping, saying, ‘This cup is the new covenant in my blood, that for you is being poured forth.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But, lo, the hand of him delivering me up is with me on the table,</verse>
  <verse number="22">and indeed the Son of Man doth go according to what hath been determined; but woe to that man through whom he is being delivered up.’</verse>
  <verse number="23">And they began to reason among themselves, who then of them it may be, who is about to do this thing.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And there happened also a strife among them—who of them is accounted to be greater.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And he said to them, ‘The kings of the nations do exercise lordship over them, and those exercising authority upon them are called benefactors;</verse>
  <verse number="26">but ye are not so, but he who is greater among you—let him be as the younger; and he who is leading, as he who is ministering;</verse>
  <verse number="27">for who is greater? he who is reclining (at meat), or he who is ministering? is it not he who is reclining (at meat)? and I—I am in your midst as he who is ministering.</verse>
  <verse number="28">‘And ye—ye are those who have remained with me in my temptations,</verse>
  <verse number="29">and I appoint to you, as my Father did appoint to me, a kingdom,</verse>
  <verse number="30">that ye may eat and may drink at my table, in my kingdom, and may sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.’</verse>
  <verse number="31">And the Lord said, ‘Simon, Simon, lo, the Adversary did ask you for himself to sift as the wheat,</verse>
  <verse number="32">and I besought for thee, that thy faith may not fail; and thou, when thou didst turn, strengthen thy brethren.’</verse>
  <verse number="33">And he said to him, ‘Sir, with thee I am ready both to prison and to death to go;’</verse>
  <verse number="34">and he said, ‘I say to thee, Peter, a cock shall not crow to-day, before thrice thou mayest disown knowing me.’</verse>
  <verse number="35">And he said to them, ‘When I sent you without bag, and scrip, and sandals, did ye lack anything?’ and they said, ‘Nothing.’</verse>
  <verse number="36">Then said he to them, ‘But, now, he who is having a bag, let him take it up, and in like manner also a scrip; and he who is not having, let him sell his garment, and buy a sword,</verse>
  <verse number="37">for I say to you, that yet this that hath been written it behoveth to be fulfilled in me: And with lawless ones he was reckoned, for also the things concerning me have an end.’</verse>
  <verse number="38">And they said, ‘Sir, lo, here are two swords;’ and he said to them, ‘It is sufficient.’</verse>
  <verse number="39">And having gone forth, he went on, according to custom, to the mount of the Olives, and his disciples also followed him,</verse>
  <verse number="40">and having come to the place, he said to them, ‘Pray ye not to enter into temptation.’</verse>
  <verse number="41">And he was withdrawn from them, as it were a stone’s cast, and having fallen on the knees he was praying,</verse>
  <verse number="42">saying, ‘Father, if Thou be counselling to make this cup pass from me—;but, not my will, but Thine be done.’—</verse>
  <verse number="43">And there appeared to him a messenger from heaven strengthening him;</verse>
  <verse number="44">and having been in agony, he was more earnestly praying, and his sweat became, as it were, great drops of blood falling upon the ground.</verse>
  <verse number="45">And having risen up from the prayer, having come unto the disciples, he found them sleeping from the sorrow,</verse>
  <verse number="46">and he said to them, ‘Why do ye sleep? having risen, pray that ye may not enter into temptation.’</verse>
  <verse number="47">And while he is speaking, lo, a multitude, and he who is called Judas, one of the twelve, was coming before them, and he came nigh to Jesus to kiss him,</verse>
  <verse number="48">and Jesus said to him, ‘Judas, with a kiss the Son of Man dost thou deliver up?’</verse>
  <verse number="49">And those about him, having seen what was about to be, said to him, ‘Sir, shall we smite with a sword?’</verse>
  <verse number="50">And a certain one of them smote the servant of the chief priest, and took off his right ear,</verse>
  <verse number="51">and Jesus answering said, ‘Suffer ye thus far,’ and having touched his ear, he healed him.</verse>
  <verse number="52">And Jesus said to those having come upon him—chief priests, and magistrates of the temple, and elders—‘As upon a robber have ye come forth, with swords and sticks?</verse>
  <verse number="53">while daily I was with you in the temple, ye did stretch forth no hands against me; but this is your hour and the power of the darkness.’</verse>
  <verse number="54">And having taken him, they led and brought him to the house of the chief priest. And Peter was following afar off,</verse>
  <verse number="55">and they having kindled a fire in the midst of the court, and having sat down together, Peter was sitting in the midst of them,</verse>
  <verse number="56">and a certain maid having seen him sitting at the light, and having earnestly looked at him, she said, ‘And this one was with him!’</verse>
  <verse number="57">and he disowned him, saying, ‘Woman, I have not known him.’</verse>
  <verse number="58">And after a little, another having seen him, said, ‘And thou art of them!’ and Peter said, ‘Man, I am not.’</verse>
  <verse number="59">And one hour, as it were, having intervened, a certain other was confidently affirming, saying, ‘Of a truth this one also was with him, for he is also a Galilean;’</verse>
  <verse number="60">and Peter said, ‘Man, I have not known what thou sayest;’ and presently, while he is speaking, a cock crew.</verse>
  <verse number="61">And the Lord having turned did look on Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him—‘Before a cock shall crow, thou mayest disown me thrice;’</verse>
  <verse number="62">and Peter having gone without, wept bitterly.</verse>
  <verse number="63">And the men who were holding Jesus were mocking him, beating him;</verse>
  <verse number="64">and having blindfolded him, they were striking him on the face, and were questioning him, saying, ‘Prophesy who he is who smote thee?’</verse>
  <verse number="65">and many other things, speaking evilly, they spake in regard to him.</verse>
  <verse number="66">And when it became day there was gathered together the eldership of the people, chief priests also, and scribes, and they led him up to their own sanhedrim,</verse>
  <verse number="67">saying, ‘If thou be the Christ, tell us.’ And he said to them, ‘If I may tell you, ye will not believe;</verse>
  <verse number="68">and if I also question you, ye will not answer me or send me away;</verse>
  <verse number="69">henceforth, there shall be the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power of God.’</verse>
  <verse number="70">And they all said, ‘Thou, then, art the Son of God?’ and he said unto them, ‘Ye say it, because I am;’</verse>
  <verse number="71">and they said, ‘What need yet have we of testimony? for we ourselves did hear it from his mouth.’</verse>
