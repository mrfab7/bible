  <verse number="1">But Eliphaz the Themanite, answering, said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">If we start to speak to you, perhaps you will take it badly, but who can hold back the words he has conceived?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Behold, you have taught many, and you have strengthened weary hands.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Your words have reassured the wavering, and you have fortified the trembling knees.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But now the scourge has overcome you, and you falter. It has touched you, and you are disturbed.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Where is your reverence, your fortitude, your patience, and the perfection of your ways?</verse>
  <verse number="7">Consider this, I beg you: who ever perished being innocent? Or when have the righteous been destroyed?</verse>
  <verse number="8">In fact, I have instead seen those who work iniquity and who sow resentments, reap them,</verse>
  <verse number="9">perishing by the breath of God, and being consumed by the wrath of his spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="10">The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the lioness, and the teeth of young lions have been worn away.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The tiger has perished because it does not have prey, and the young lions have been scattered.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Furthermore, a word was spoken to me in secret, and, as if by theft, my ears received the pulse of its whisper.</verse>
  <verse number="13">In the horror of a vision by night, when men are accustomed to be overtaken by a deep sleep,</verse>
  <verse number="14">fear and trembling seized me and all my bones were terrified.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And when a spirit passed before me, the hair on my body stood up.</verse>
  <verse number="16">There appeared an image before my eyes, someone whose face I did not recognize, and I heard a voice like a gentle breeze.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Should man be justified in relation to God, or will a man be more pure than his Maker?</verse>
  <verse number="18">Behold, those who serve him are not steadfast, and in his angels he finds imperfection.</verse>
  <verse number="19">How much more will those who live in houses of clay, which have an earthly foundation, be consumed like the moth?</verse>
  <verse number="20">From morning all the way to evening, they will be cut down, and because no one understands, they will be destroyed without ceasing.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But those who are left behind will be taken away from them; they will die, and not in wisdom.</verse>
