<p class="verse" data-verse="1">At that time Herod the tetrarch heard the reports about Jesus</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist; he has risen from the dead! That is why miraculous powers are at work in him.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Now Herod had arrested John and bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">because John had been telling him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Although Herod wanted to kill John, he was afraid of the people, because they regarded John as a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">On Herod’s birthday, however, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">so much that he promised with an oath to give to her whatever she asked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me here on a platter the head of John the Baptist.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The king was grieved, but because of his oaths and his guests, he ordered that her wish be granted</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">and sent to have John beheaded in the prison.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">John’s head was brought in on a platter and presented to the girl, who carried it to her mother.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Then John’s disciples came and took his body and buried it. And they went and informed Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">When Jesus heard about John, He withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place. But the crowds found out about it and followed Him on foot from the towns.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">When He stepped ashore and saw a large crowd, He had compassion on them and healed their sick.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">When evening came, the disciples came to Him and said, “This is a desolate place, and the hour is already late. Dismiss the crowds so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">“They do not need to go away,” Jesus replied. “You give them something to eat.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">“We have here only five loaves of bread and two fish,” they answered.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">“Bring them here to Me,” Jesus said.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And He directed the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, He spoke a blessing. Then He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">They all ate and were satisfied, and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">About five thousand men were fed, besides women and children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of Him to the other side, while He dismissed the crowds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">After He had dismissed them, He went up on the mountain by Himself to pray. When evening came, He was there alone,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">but the boat was already far from land, buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">During the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went out to them, walking on the sea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">When the disciples saw Him walking on the sea, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost!” they said, and cried out in fear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">But Jesus spoke up at once: “Take courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">“Lord, if it is You,” Peter replied, “command me to come to You on the water.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">“Come,” said Jesus. Then Peter got down out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">But when he saw the strength of the wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out, “Lord, save me!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Immediately Jesus reached out His hand and took hold of Peter. “You of little faith,” He said, “why did you doubt?”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And when they had climbed back into the boat, the wind died down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Then those who were in the boat worshiped Him, saying, “Truly You are the Son of God!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">When they had crossed over, they landed at Gennesaret.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And when the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word to all the surrounding region. People brought all the sick to Him</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">and begged Him just to let them touch the fringe of His cloak. And all who touched Him were healed.</p>
