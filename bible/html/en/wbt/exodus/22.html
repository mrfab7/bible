<p class="verse" data-verse="3">If the sun shall have risen upon him, there shall be blood shed for him: for he should make full restitution; if he have nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If the theft shall be certainly found in his hand alive, whether an ox, or ass, or sheep; he shall restore double.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten, and shall put in his beast, and shall feed in another man’s field: of the best of his own field, and of the best of his own vineyard shall he make restitution.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If fire shall break out, and catch in thorns, so that the stacks of corn, or the standing corn, or the field shall be consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Ye shall not afflict any widow, or fatherless child.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">If thou shalt afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all to me, I will surely hear their cry:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If thou shalt lend money to any of my people that is poor by thee, thou shalt not be to him as a usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For that is his only covering, it is his raiment for his skin: wherein shall he sleep? and it shall come to pass, when he crieth to me, that I will hear; for I am gracious.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Thou shalt not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of thy people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors: the first-born of thy sons shalt thou give to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Likewise shalt thou do with thy oxen, and with thy sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And ye shall be holy men to me: neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.</p>
