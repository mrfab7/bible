<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say unto him, Thou wast likened unto a young lion of the nations: yet art thou as a dragon in the seas; and thou brakest forth with thy rivers, and troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Thus saith the Lord GOD: I will spread out my net over thee with a company of many peoples; and they shall bring thee up in my net.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And I will leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to settle upon thee, and I will satisfy the beasts of the whole earth with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the valleys with thy height.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest, even to the mountains; and the watercourses shall be full of thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And when I shall extinguish thee, I will cover the heaven, and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I will also vex the hearts of many peoples, when I shall bring thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast not known.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Yea, I will make many peoples amazed at thee, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For thus saith the Lord GOD: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall; the terrible of the nations are they all: and they shall spoil the pride of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside many waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor the hoofs of beasts trouble them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then will I make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste, a land destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament; the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith: for Egypt, and for all her multitude, shall they lament therewith, saith the Lord GOD.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="25">They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her multitude; her graves are round about her: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for their terror was caused in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with them that go down to the pit: he is put in the midst of them that be slain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude; her graves are round about her: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for they caused their terror in the land of the living.</p>
