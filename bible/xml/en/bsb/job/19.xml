  <verse number="1">Then Job answered:</verse>
  <verse number="2">“How long will you torment me and crush me with your words?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Ten times now you have reproached me; you shamelessly mistreat me.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Even if I have truly gone astray, my error concerns me alone.</verse>
  <verse number="5">If indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my disgrace against me,</verse>
  <verse number="6">then understand that it is God who has wronged me and drawn His net around me.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Though I cry out, ‘Violence!’ I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice.</verse>
  <verse number="8">He has blocked my way so I cannot pass; He has veiled my paths with darkness.</verse>
  <verse number="9">He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.</verse>
  <verse number="10">He tears me down on every side until I am gone; He uproots my hope like a tree.</verse>
  <verse number="11">His anger burns against me, and He counts me among His enemies.</verse>
  <verse number="12">His troops advance together; they construct a ramp against me and encamp around my tent.</verse>
  <verse number="13">He has removed my brothers from me; my acquaintances have abandoned me.</verse>
  <verse number="14">My kinsmen have failed me, and my friends have forgotten me.</verse>
  <verse number="15">My guests and maidservants count me as a stranger; I am a foreigner in their sight.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I call for my servant, but he does not answer, though I implore him with my own mouth.</verse>
  <verse number="17">My breath is repulsive to my wife, and I am loathsome to my own family.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Even little boys scorn me; when I appear, they deride me.</verse>
  <verse number="19">All my best friends despise me, and those I love have turned against me.</verse>
  <verse number="20">My skin and flesh cling to my bones; I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Have pity on me, my friends, have pity, for the hand of God has struck me.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Why do you persecute me as God does? Will you never get enough of my flesh?</verse>
  <verse number="23">I wish that my words were recorded and inscribed in a book,</verse>
  <verse number="24">by an iron stylus on lead, or chiseled in stone forever.</verse>
  <verse number="25">But I know that my Redeemer lives, and in the end He will stand upon the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Even after my skin has been destroyed, yet in my flesh I will see God.</verse>
  <verse number="27">I will see Him for myself; my eyes will behold Him, and not as a stranger. How my heart yearns within me!</verse>
  <verse number="28">If you say, ‘Let us persecute him, since the root of the matter lies with him,’</verse>
  <verse number="29">then you should fear the sword yourselves, because wrath brings punishment by the sword, so that you may know there is a judgment.”</verse>
