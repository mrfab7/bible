  <verse number="1">And Jehovah will be seen to him at the oaks of Mamra: and he will sit at the entrance of his tent at the heat of the day.</verse>
  <verse number="2">And he shall lift up his eyes and shall see, and behold, three men stood by him: and he will see and will run to meet them from the door of the tent, and will bow himself to the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he will say, Lord, if now I found grace in thine eyes, now thou wilt not pass away from thy servant.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Now he shall take a little water, and will wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And I will take a bit of food, and strengthen your heart, afterwards ye shall pass away; for, for this ye passed over to your servant And they will say, Thou shalt do according to what thou saidst.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And Abraham will hasten to the tent to Sarah, and will say, Hasten thou measures of the finest flour; knead and make cakes.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And Abraham running to the oxen, will take the son of a cow, tender and good, and will give to the youth, and he will hasten to do it.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And he will take curdled milk, and new milk, and the son of the cow which he did, and he will give before their face; and he stood by them under the tree, and they shall eat.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And they will say to him, Where is Sarah thy wife? and he will say, Behold, in the tent.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And he will say, Returning, I will return to thee according to the time of life; and behold, a son to Sarah thy wife. And Sarah heard at the door of the tent, and she behind him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And Abraham and Sarah were old, being gone in days; the way according to women ceased to be to Sarah.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And Sarah will laugh within her, saying, After it has not been to me till now, and my lord, being old.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Jehovah will say to Abraham, For what did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall truly even I bring forth, and I have become old?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Shall the word of Jehovah be difficult, at the appointed time? I will return to thee, according to the time of life, and a son to Sarah.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Sarah will deny, saying, I did not laugh; for she was afraid. And he will say, Nay, for thou didst laugh.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And the men will rise up from thence, and will look forth upon the face of Sodom: and Abraham went forth with them to accompany them.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham what I do?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Abraham being, shall be for a great and numerous nation, and all the nations of the earth shall bless themselves in him.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For I know him, for that he will command his sons and his house after him; and they watched the way of Jehovah to do justice and judgment, for Jehovah to bring upon Abraham what he spake to him.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Jehovah will say, The cry of Sodom and Gomorrah became great, and because their sin was exceedingly heavy,</verse>
  <verse number="21">I will go now and see whether they did wholly according to its cry coming to me; and if not, I shall know.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the men will turn back from thence, and will go forth to Sodom: and Abraham stood yet before the face of Jehovah.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And Abraham will draw near, and will say, Wilt thou also destroy the just with the wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Perhaps there is fifty just in the midst of the city: wilt thou also destroy and not forgive the place for the sake of the fifty just which are within it?</verse>
  <verse number="25">Far be it with respect to thee doing as this word to kill the just with the wicked; and for the just to be as the wicked, far be it with respect to thee: shall not the judge of all the earth do judgment?</verse>
  <verse number="26">And Jehovah will say, If I shall find in Sodom fifty just, in the midst of the city, I forgive all the place for their sakes.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And Abraham will answer and say, Behold now, I have undertaken to speak to my Lord, and I dust and ashes.</verse>
  <verse number="28">If the fifty just shall lack five: wilt thou destroy for sake of five all the city? And he will say, I will not destroy, if I shall find there forty and five.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And he added yet to speak to him, and he will say, If forty shall be found there? And he will say, I will not do for sake of forty.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And he will say, Now will it not kindle to the Lord, and I will speak: If thirty shall be found there? And he will say, I will not do, if I shall find thirty there.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And he will say, Behold now, I have begun to speak to the Lord If twenty shall be found there? And he will say, I will not destroy for sake of twenty.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And he will say, Now will it not be angry to the Lord, and I will speak only this once: If ten shall be found there? And he will say, I will not destroy for sake of ten.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And Jehovah went forth after that he finished to speak to Abraham: and Abraham returned to his place.</verse>
