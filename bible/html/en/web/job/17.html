<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="17" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“My spirit is consumed. My days are extinct, And the grave is ready for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Surely there are mockers with me. My eye dwells on their provocation.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">“Now give a pledge, be collateral for me with yourself. Who is there who will strike hands with me?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For you have hidden their heart from understanding, Therefore you shall not exalt them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He who denounces his friends for a prey, Even the eyes of his children shall fail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">“But he has made me a byword of the people. They spit in my face.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">My eye also is dim by reason of sorrow. All my members are as a shadow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Upright men shall be astonished at this. The innocent shall stir up himself against the godless.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Yet shall the righteous hold on his way. He who has clean hands shall grow stronger and stronger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">But as for you all, come on now again; I shall not find a wise man among you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">My days are past, my plans are broken off, as are the thoughts of my heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">They change the night into day, saying ‘The light is near’ in the presence of darkness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I look for Sheol as my house, if I have spread my couch in the darkness,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If I have said to corruption, ‘You are my father;’ to the worm, ‘My mother,’ and ‘my sister;’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">where then is my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Shall it go down with me to the gates of Sheol, or descend together into the dust?”</p>
