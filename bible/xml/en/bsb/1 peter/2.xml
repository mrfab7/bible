<chapter book="1 Peter" number="2" translation="Berean Standard Bible" translationID="bsb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Rid yourselves, therefore, of all malice, deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation,</verse>
  <verse number="3">now that you have tasted that the Lord is good.</verse>
  <verse number="4">As you come to Him, the living stone, rejected by men but chosen and precious in God’s sight,</verse>
  <verse number="5">you also, like living stones, are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For it stands in Scripture: “See, I lay in Zion a stone, a chosen and precious cornerstone; and the one who believes in Him will never be put to shame.”</verse>
  <verse number="7">To you who believe, then, this stone is precious. But to those who do not believe, “The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,”</verse>
  <verse number="8">and, “A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense.” They stumble because they disobey the word—and to this they were appointed.</verse>
  <verse number="9">But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession, to proclaim the virtues of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Beloved, I urge you, as foreigners and exiles, to abstain from the desires of the flesh, which war against your soul.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Conduct yourselves with such honor among the Gentiles that, though they slander you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day He visits us.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Submit yourselves for the Lord’s sake to every human institution, whether to the king as the supreme authority,</verse>
  <verse number="14">or to governors as those sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For it is God’s will that by doing good you should silence the ignorance of foolish men.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Live in freedom, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as servants of God.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Treat everyone with high regard: Love the brotherhood of believers, fear God, honor the king.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Servants, submit yourselves to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but even to those who are unreasonable.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For if anyone endures the pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of God, this is to be commended.</verse>
  <verse number="20">How is it to your credit if you are beaten for doing wrong and you endure it? But if you suffer for doing good and you endure it, this is commendable before God.</verse>
  <verse number="21">For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in His footsteps:</verse>
  <verse number="22">“He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in His mouth.”</verse>
  <verse number="23">When they heaped abuse on Him, He did not retaliate; when He suffered, He made no threats, but entrusted Himself to Him who judges justly.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. “By His stripes you are healed.”</verse>
  <verse number="25">For “you were like sheep going astray,” but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</verse>
