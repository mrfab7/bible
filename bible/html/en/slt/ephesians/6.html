<div class="chapter" data-book="Ephesians" data-chapter="6" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Children, listen to your parents in the Lord: for this is just.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first command with solemn promise;)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">That it may be well to thee, and thou mayest be long time upon earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And, fathers, be not angry with your children: but bring them up in the instruction and reminding of the Lord.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Servants, listen to lords according to the flesh, with fear and tremor, in simplicity of your heart, as to Christ;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Not with eye-service, as menpleasers; but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">With affection serving the Lord, and not men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Knowing that whatever good each might do, this he shall receive from the Lord, whether a servant or free.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And, lords, do ye the same things to them, letting go threatening: knowing that also your own Lord is in the heavens; and distinction of persons is not with him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">As to the rest, my brethren, be strengthened in the Lord, and in the strength of his power.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Put on the complete armor of God, for you to be able to stand against the artifices of the accuser.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">For the wrestling is not to us against blood and flesh, but against beginnings, against powers, against the chiefs of the world of darkness of this life, against spiritual things of wickedness in heavenly things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For this take up the complete armor of God, that ye might be able to withstand in the evil day, and having effected all things, to stand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Stand therefore, having girded your loins around with truth, and put on the armor of justice;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And fastened under the feet in preparation of the good news of peace;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Over all, having taken the shield of faith, in which ye shall be able to quench all the inflamed darts of evil.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And take ye the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">By all prayer and supplication praying in all time in Spirit, and for this same watching vigilantly in all perseverance and supplication for the holy:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And for me, that the word might be given me, in the opening of my mouth in freedom of speech, to make known the mystery of the good news,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For which I am an ambassador in perplexity: that in it I might speak freely, as I ought to speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And that ye also might know the things concerning me, what I do, Tychicus will make all things known to you, the dearly beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Whom I sent to you for this same, that ye might know the things concerning us, and he might comfort your hearts.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Peace to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Grace with all loving our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruptibleness. Amen.</p>
