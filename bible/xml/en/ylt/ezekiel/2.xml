  <verse number="1">It is the appearance of the likeness of the honour of Jehovah, and I see, and fall on my face, and I hear a voice speaking, and He saith unto me, ‘Son of man, stand on thy feet, and I speak with thee.’</verse>
  <verse number="2">And there doth come into me a spirit, when He hath spoken unto me, and it causeth me to stand on my feet, and I hear Him who is speaking unto me.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And He saith unto Me, ‘Son of man, I am sending thee unto the sons of Israel, unto nations who are rebels, who have rebelled against Me; they and their fathers have transgressed against Me, unto this self-same day.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And the sons are brazen-faced and hard-hearted to whom I am sending thee, and thou hast said unto them: Thus said the Lord Jehovah:</verse>
  <verse number="5">and they—whether they hear, or whether they forbear, for a rebellious house they are—have known that a prophet hath been in their midst.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And thou, son of man, thou art not afraid of them, yea, of their words thou art not afraid, for briers and thorns are with thee, and near scorpions thou art dwelling, of their words thou art not afraid, and of their faces thou art not affrighted, for they are a rebellious house,</verse>
  <verse number="7">And thou hast spoken My words unto them, whether they hear or whether they forbear, for they are rebellious.</verse>
  <verse number="8">‘And thou, son of man, hear that which I am speaking unto thee: Thou art not rebellious like the rebellious house, open thy mouth, and eat that which I am giving unto thee.’</verse>
  <verse number="9">And I look, and lo, a hand is sent forth unto me, and lo, in it a roll of a book,</verse>
  <verse number="10">and He spreadeth it before me, and it is written in front and behind, and written on it are lamentations, and mourning, and woe!</verse>
