  <verse number="1">In these days John the Baptist is present, proclaiming in the desert of Judea;</verse>
  <verse number="2">And saying, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For this is he spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, A voice of him crying in the desert, Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And this John had his garment from camel’s hair, and a leather girdle about his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all round about Jordan;</verse>
  <verse number="6">And they were immersed in Jordan by him, acknowledging their sins.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his immersion, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who has indicated to you to flee from the wrath about to come?</verse>
  <verse number="8">Do ye therefore fruit worthy of repentance.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And think not to say in yourselves we have Abraham a father; for I say to you, that God can of these stones raise up children to Abraham.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And now also the axe lies at the root of the trees; therefore every one not making good fruit is cut off and cast into fire.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I truly immerse you in water to repentance; but he coming after me is stronger than I, whose shoes I am not fit to lift up; he shall immerse in the Holy Spirit, and fire.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Whose winnowing fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor, and gather his wheat into the store; but he will burn down the chaff in inextinguishable fire.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then Jesus approaches from Galilee to Jordan, to John, to be immersed by him.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And John hindered him, saying, I have need to be immersed by thee, and dost thou come to me?</verse>
  <verse number="15">And Jesus having answered said to him, Permit now; for so it is suitable for us to complete all justice: then he permitted him.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And Jesus, having been immersed, went up straight from the water, and, behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And behold a voice from the heavens, saying, This is my dearly beloved Son, in whom I was contented.</verse>
