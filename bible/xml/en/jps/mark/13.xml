  <verse number="1">As He was leaving the Temple, one of His disciples exclaimed, “Look, Rabbi, what wonderful stones! what wonderful buildings!”</verse>
  <verse number="2">“You see all these great buildings?” Jesus replied; “not one stone will be left here upon another—not thrown down.”</verse>
  <verse number="3">He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite to the Temple, when Peter, James, John, and Andrew, apart from the others asked Him,</verse>
  <verse number="4">“Tell us, When will these things be? and what will be the sign when all these predictions are on the point of being fulfilled?”</verse>
  <verse number="5">So Jesus began to say to them: “Take care that no one misleads you.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Many will come assuming my name and saying, ‘I am He;’ and they will mislead many.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But when you hear of wars and rumours of wars, do not be alarmed: come they must, but the End is not yet.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For nation will rise in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. These miseries are but like the early pains of childbirth.</verse>
  <verse number="9">“You yourselves must be on your guard. They will deliver you up to Sanhedrins; you will be brought into synagogues and cruelly beaten; and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake, to be witnesses to them for me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">But the proclamation of the Good News must be carried to all the Gentiles before the End comes.</verse>
  <verse number="11">When however they are marching you along under arrest, do not be anxious beforehand about what you are to say, but speak what is given you when the time comes; for it will not be you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="12">“Brother will betray brother to be killed, and fathers will betray children; and children will rise against their parents and have them put to death.</verse>
  <verse number="13">You will be objects of universal hatred because you are called by my name, but those who stand firm to the End will be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="14">“As soon, however, as you see the Abomination of Desolation standing where he ought not”—let the reader observe these words—”then let those in Judaea escape to the hills;</verse>
  <verse number="15">let him who is on the roof not come down and enter the house to fetch anything out of it;</verse>
  <verse number="16">and let not him who is in the field turn back to pick up his outer garment.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And alas for the women who at that time are with child or have infants!</verse>
  <verse number="18">“But pray that it may not come in the winter.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For those will be times of suffering the like of which has never been from the first creation of God’s world until now, and assuredly never will be again;</verse>
  <verse number="20">and but for the fact that the Lord has cut short those days, no one would escape; but for the sake of His own People whom He has chosen for Himself He has cut short the days.</verse>
  <verse number="21">“At that time if any one says to you, ‘See, here is the Christ!’ or ‘See, He is there!’ do not believe it.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For there will rise up false Christs and false prophets, displaying signs and prodigies with a view to lead astray—if indeed that were possible—even God’s own People.</verse>
  <verse number="23">But as for yourselves, be on your guard: I have forewarned you of everything.</verse>
  <verse number="24">“At that time, however, after that distress, the sun will be darkened and the moon will not shed her light;</verse>
  <verse number="25">the stars will be seen falling from the firmament, and the forces which are in the heavens will be disordered and disturbed.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And then will they see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory.</verse>
  <verse number="27">Then He will send forth the angels and gather together His chosen People from north, south, east and west, from the remotest parts of the earth and the sky.</verse>
  <verse number="28">“Learn from the fig-tree the lesson it teaches. As soon as its branch has become soft and it is bursting into leaf, you know that summer is near.</verse>
  <verse number="29">So also do you, when you see these things happening, be sure that He is near, at your very door.</verse>
  <verse number="30">I tell you in solemn truth that the present generation will certainly not pass away without all these things having first taken place.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Earth and sky will pass away, but it is certain that my words will not pass away.</verse>
  <verse number="32">“But as to that day or the exact time no one knows—not even the angels in Heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Take care, be on the alert, and pray; for you do not know when it will happen.</verse>
  <verse number="34">It is like a man living abroad who has left his house, and given the management to his servants—to each one his special duty—and has ordered the porter to keep awake.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Be wakeful therefore, for you know not when the master of the house is coming—in the evening, at midnight, at cock-crow, or at dawn.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Beware lest He should arrive unexpectedly and find you asleep.</verse>
  <verse number="37">Moreover, what I say to you I say to all—Be wakeful!”</verse>
