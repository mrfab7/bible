  <verse number="1">Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints in Ephesus, the faithful in Christ Jesus:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless in His presence. In love</verse>
  <verse number="5">He predestined us for adoption as His sons through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of His will,</verse>
  <verse number="6">to the praise of His glorious grace, which He has freely given us in the Beloved One.</verse>
  <verse number="7">In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace</verse>
  <verse number="8">that He lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And He has made known to us the mystery of His will according to His good pleasure, which He purposed in Christ</verse>
  <verse number="10">as a plan for the fullness of time, to bring all things in heaven and on earth together in Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="11">In Him we were also chosen as God’s own, having been predestined according to the plan of Him who works out everything by the counsel of His will,</verse>
  <verse number="12">in order that we, who were the first to hope in Christ, would be for the praise of His glory.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And in Him, having heard and believed the word of truth—the gospel of your salvation—you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,</verse>
  <verse number="14">who is the pledge of our inheritance until the redemption of those who are God’s possession, to the praise of His glory.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,</verse>
  <verse number="16">I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers,</verse>
  <verse number="17">that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in your knowledge of Him.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I ask that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened, so that you may know the hope of His calling, the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints,</verse>
  <verse number="19">and the surpassing greatness of His power to us who believe. These are in accordance with the working of His mighty strength,</verse>
  <verse number="20">which He exerted in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly realms,</verse>
  <verse number="21">far above all rule and authority, power and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in the present age but also in the one to come.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And God put everything under His feet and made Him head over everything for the church,</verse>
  <verse number="23">which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all.</verse>
