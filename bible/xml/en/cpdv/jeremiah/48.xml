<chapter book="Jeremiah" number="48" translation="Catholic Public Domain Version" translationID="cpdv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Against Moab, thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: “Woe upon Nebo! For it has been devastated and confounded. Kiriathaim has been seized; the strong one has been confounded and has trembled.</verse>
  <verse number="2">There is no longer any rejoicing in Moab over Heshbon. They have devised evil. ‘Come and let us destroy it as a nation.’ Then you will be utterly silenced, and the sword will pursue you.</verse>
  <verse number="3">A voice of clamor from Horonaim: devastation and great destruction!</verse>
  <verse number="4">Moab has been crushed. Announce an outcry for her little ones.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For, along the ascent of Luhith, the mourner will ascend with weeping. For, on the descent of Horonaim, the enemies have heard the wailing of devastation.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Flee, save your lives! And you shall be like a saltcedar tree in the desert.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For because you have had faith in your fortifications and in your storehouses, you too will be seized. And Chemosh will go into captivity: his priests and his leaders together.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And the despoiler will overwhelm every city, and not a single city will be saved. And the valleys will perish, and the fields will be destroyed. For the Lord has spoken.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Give a blossom to Moab. For it will depart when it is blossoming. And its cities will become desolate and uninhabited.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Cursed is he who does the work of the Lord deceitfully. And cursed is he who prohibits his sword from blood.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Moab has been fertile from his youth, and he has rested amid his brood. And he has not been transferred from vessel to vessel, nor has he gone into the transmigration. Therefore, his taste has remained with him, and his scent has not changed.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Because of this, behold, the days are approaching, says the Lord, when I will send to him those who will line up and knock down his bottles, and they will knock him down and empty his vessels, and they will break their bottles against one another.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And Moab will be confounded by Chemosh, just as the house of Israel was shamed by Bethel, in which they had faith.</verse>
  <verse number="14">How can you say: ‘We are strong and robust men of battle?’</verse>
  <verse number="15">Moab has been devastated, and they have cut down her cities. And her elect young men have descended to slaughter. So says the King, whose name is the Lord of hosts.</verse>
  <verse number="16">The passing away of Moab draws near and arrives. Its evil will rush forward with great speed.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Console him, all you who surround him and all you who know his name. Say: ‘How has the strong staff become broken, the glorious staff?’</verse>
  <verse number="18">Descend from your glory, and sit in thirst, O habitation of the daughter of Dibon! For the destroyer of Moab has ascended to you; he has dissipated your fortifications.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Stand in the way, and gaze out, O habitation of Aroer! Question him who is fleeing, and say to him who has escaped: ‘What has happened?’</verse>
  <verse number="20">Moab has been confounded, because he has been conquered. Wail and cry out! Announce it in Arnon: Moab has been devastated,</verse>
  <verse number="21">and judgment has arrived upon the land of the plains: upon Holon, and upon Jahzah, and upon Mephaath,</verse>
  <verse number="22">and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon the house of Deblathaim,</verse>
  <verse number="23">and upon Kiriathaim, and upon the house of Gamul, and upon the house of Meon,</verse>
  <verse number="24">and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, those far away and those nearby.</verse>
  <verse number="25">The horn of Moab has been cut away, and his arm has been crushed, says the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Inebriate him, for he has lifted himself up against the Lord. And Moab will thrust his hand into his own vomit, and also now he himself will become a derision.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For Israel had been a derision to them. It was as if you had discovered him among thieves. Because of your own words, then, which you have spoken against him, you will be led away captive.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Relinquish the cities, and live upon a rock, O inhabitants of Moab, and be like a dove nesting at the mouth of an opening at the summit.</verse>
  <verse number="29">We have listened to the arrogance of Moab; he is very proud: his exaltation, and arrogance, and pride, and the loftiness of his heart.</verse>
  <verse number="30">I myself know, says the Lord, his boasting, and that his ability is not in accord with it, nor is it in accord with what he has been striving to do.</verse>
  <verse number="31">For this reason, I will wail over Moab, and I will cry out to all of Moab, to the men on the brick wall who are lamenting.</verse>
  <verse number="32">O vineyard of Sibmah, I will weep for you, with the mourning of Jazer. Your offshoots have crossed over the sea. They have reached even to the sea of Jazer. The despoiler has rushed over your harvest and your vintage.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Rejoicing and exultation has been taken away from Carmel and from the land of Moab. And I have taken the wine from the winepresses. The treader of grapes will no longer sing the usual rhythmic chant.</verse>
  <verse number="34">From the outcry of Heshbon, even to Elealeh and Jahzah, they have uttered their voice; from Zoar, even to Horonaim, like a three year old calf. So too, the waters of Nimrim will be very bad.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And I will take away from Moab, says the Lord, the one who makes offerings in exalted places, and the one who sacrifices to his gods.</verse>
  <verse number="36">Because of this, my heart will resound for Moab, like the pipes, and my heart will make a sound like the pipes for the men on the brick wall. For he has done more than he was able, yet still they have perished.</verse>
  <verse number="37">For every head will be bald, and every beard will be shaved. All the hands will be bound together, and there will be haircloth on every back.</verse>
  <verse number="38">Over all the rooftops of Moab, and in its streets, everyone will mourn. For I have crushed Moab like a useless vessel, says the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="39">How was it conquered, so that they would wail? How is it that Moab has cast down his neck and been confounded? And Moab will be a derision and an example to everyone around him.”</verse>
  <verse number="40">Thus says the Lord: “Behold, he will fly like the eagle, and he will extend his wings to Moab.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Kerioth has been captured, and the fortifications have been taken. And in that day, the heart of the strong ones of Moab will be like the heart of a woman giving birth.</verse>
  <verse number="42">And Moab will cease to be a people. For he has been glorified against the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="43">Terror and the pit and the snare will overwhelm you, O inhabitant of Moab, says the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="44">Whoever flees from the terror will fall into the pit. And whoever climbs out of the pit will be seized by the snare. For I will lead over Moab the year of their visitation, says the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="45">Those fleeing from the snare stood in the shadow of Heshbon. For a fire has gone forth from Heshbon, and a flame from the midst of Sihon, and it will devour the portion of Moab, and the top of the head of the sons of tumult.</verse>
  <verse number="46">Woe to you, O Moab! You have been ruined, O people of Chemosh! For your sons and your daughters have been taken into captivity.</verse>
  <verse number="47">But I will convert the captivity of Moab in the last days, says the Lord.” Such are the judgments of Moab thus far.</verse>
