<chapter book="Isaiah" number="10" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Woe to them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have prescribed;</verse>
  <verse number="2">To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!</verse>
  <verse number="3">And what will you do in the day of visitation, and in the desolation which shall come from far? to whom will you flee for help? and where will you leave your glory?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</verse>
  <verse number="5">O Assyrian, the rod of my anger, and the staff in their hand is my indignation.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</verse>
  <verse number="7">However, he means not so, neither does his heart think so; but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a few.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For he said, Are not my princes altogether kings?</verse>
  <verse number="9">Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?</verse>
  <verse number="10">As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;</verse>
  <verse number="11">Shall I not, as I have done to Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Why it shall come to pass, that when the Lord has performed his whole work on mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For he said, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man:</verse>
  <verse number="14">And my hand has found as a nest the riches of the people: and as one gathers eggs that are left, have I gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Shall the ax boast itself against him that hews therewith? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shakes it? as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no wood.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;</verse>
  <verse number="18">And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a standard-bearer faints.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a child may write them.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay on him that smote them; but shall stay on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.</verse>
  <verse number="21">The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall overflow with righteousness.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even determined, in the middle of all the land.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Therefore thus said the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that dwell in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall smite you with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against you, after the manner of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="25">For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease, and my anger in their destruction.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a whip for him according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and as his rod was on the sea, so shall he lift it up after the manner of Egypt.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall be taken away from off your shoulder, and his yoke from off your neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing.</verse>
  <verse number="28">He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he has laid up his carriages:</verse>
  <verse number="29">They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.</verse>
  <verse number="30">Lift up your voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard to Laish, O poor Anathoth.</verse>
  <verse number="31">Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather themselves to flee.</verse>
  <verse number="32">As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.</verse>
