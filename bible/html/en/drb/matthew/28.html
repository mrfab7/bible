<p class="verse" data-verse="1">AND in the end of the sabbath, when it began to dawn towards the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalen and the other Mary, to see the sepulchre.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And behold there was a great earthquake. For an angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and coming, rolled back the stone, and sat upon it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And his countenance was as lightning, and his raiment as snow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And for fear of him, the guards were struck with terror, and became as dead men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And the angel answering, said to the women: Fear not you; for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He is not here, for he is risen, as he said. Come, and see the place where the Lord was laid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And going quickly, tell ye his disciples that he is risen: and behold he will go before you into Galilee; there you shall see him. Lo, I have foretold it to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And they went out quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy, running to tell his disciples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And behold Jesus met them, saying: All hail. But they came up and took hold of his feet, and adored him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Then Jesus said to them: Fear not. Go, tell my brethren that they go into Galilee, there they shall see me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Who when they were departed, behold some of the guards came into the city, and told the chief priests all things that had been done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And they being assembled together with the ancients, taking counsel, gave a great sum of money to the soldiers,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Saying: Say you, His disciples came by night, and stole him away when we were asleep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And if the governor shall hear this, we will persuade him, and secure you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">So they taking the money, did as they were taught: and this word was spread abroad among the Jews even unto this day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the eleven disciples went into Galilee, unto the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And seeing them they adored: but some doubted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And Jesus coming, spoke to them, saying: All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Going therefore, teach ye all nations; baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and behold I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world.</p>
