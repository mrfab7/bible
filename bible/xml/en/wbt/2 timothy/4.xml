  <verse number="1">I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</verse>
  <verse number="2">Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the time will come, when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts will they multiply to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</verse>
  <verse number="4">And they will turn away their ears from the truth, and will be turned to fables.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</verse>

  <verse number="9">Do thy diligence to come shortly to me:</verse>
  <verse number="10">For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and hath departed to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.</verse>

  <verse number="15">Of whom be thou aware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.</verse>
  <verse number="16">At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Notwithstanding, the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me to his heavenly kingdom; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
