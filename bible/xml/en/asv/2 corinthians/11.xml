<chapter book="2 Corinthians" number="11" translation="American Standard Version" translationID="asv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Would that ye could bear with me in a little foolishness: but indeed ye do bear with me.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For I am jealous over you with a godly jealousy: for I espoused you to one husband, that I might present you as a pure virgin to Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="3">But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve in his craftiness, your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity and the purity that is toward Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we did not preach, or if ye receive a different spirit, which ye did not receive, or a different gospel, which ye did not accept, ye do well to bear with him.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For I reckon that I am not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But though I be rude in speech, yet am I not in knowledge; nay, in every way have we made this manifest unto you in all things.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Or did I commit a sin in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I preached to you the gospel of God for nought?</verse>
  <verse number="8">I robbed other churches, taking wages of them that I might minister unto you;</verse>
  <verse number="9">and when I was present with you and was in want, I was not a burden on any man; for the brethren, when they came from Macedonia, supplied the measure of my want; and in everything I kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.</verse>
  <verse number="10">As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this glorying in the regions of Achaia.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them that desire an occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For such men are false apostles, deceitful workers, fashioning themselves into apostles of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And no marvel; for even Satan fashioneth himself into an angel of light.</verse>
  <verse number="15">It is no great thing therefore if his ministers also fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their works.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I say again, Let no man think me foolish; but if ye do, yet as foolish receive me, that I also may glory a little.</verse>
  <verse number="17">That which I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of glorying.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.</verse>
  <verse number="19">For ye bear with the foolish gladly, being wise yourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For ye bear with a man, if he bringeth you into bondage, if he devoureth you, if he taketh you captive, if he exalteth himself, if he smiteth you on the face.</verse>
  <verse number="21">I speak by way of disparagement, as though we had been weak. Yet whereinsoever any is bold (I speak in foolishness), I am bold also.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as one beside himself) I more; in labors more abundantly, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths oft.</verse>
  <verse number="24">Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day have I been in the deep;</verse>
  <verse number="26">in journeyings often, in perils of rivers, in perils of robbers, in perils from my countrymen, in perils from the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;</verse>
  <verse number="27">in labor and travail, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Besides those things that are without, there is that which presseth upon me daily, anxiety for all the churches.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is caused to stumble, and I burn not?</verse>
  <verse number="30">If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things that concern my weakness.</verse>
  <verse number="31">The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed for evermore knoweth that I lie not.</verse>
  <verse number="32">In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king guarded the city of the Damascenes in order to take me:</verse>
  <verse number="33">and through a window was I let down in a basket by the wall, and escaped his hands.</verse>
