  <verse number="1">When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee:</verse>

  <verse number="3">Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful food.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Labor not to be rich: cease from thy own wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Wilt thou set thy eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make to themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle towards heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainties:</verse>
  <verse number="7">For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:</verse>
  <verse number="11">For their redeemer is mighty; he will plead their cause with thee.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Apply thy heart to instruction, and thy ears to the words of knowledge.</verse>

  <verse number="18">For surely there is an end; and thy expectation shall not be cut off.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thy heart in the way.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Be not among wine-bibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:</verse>
  <verse number="21">For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Hearken to thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.</verse>

  <verse number="26">My son, give me thy heart, and let thy eyes observe my ways.</verse>
  <verse number="27">For a lewd woman is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.</verse>
  <verse number="28">She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.</verse>
  <verse number="29">Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?</verse>
  <verse number="30">They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.</verse>

  <verse number="32">At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.</verse>
  <verse number="33">Thy eyes shall behold strange women, and thy heart shall utter perverse things.</verse>
  <verse number="34">And thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.</verse>
  <verse number="35">They have stricken me, wilt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.</verse>
