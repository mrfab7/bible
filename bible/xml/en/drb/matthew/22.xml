  <verse number="1">AND Jesus answering, spoke again in parables to them, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="2">The kingdom of heaven is likened to a king, who made a marriage for his son.</verse>
  <verse number="3">And he sent his servants, to call them that were invited to the marriage; and they would not come.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Again he sent other servants, saying: Tell them that were invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my beeves and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come ye to the marriage.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But they neglected, and went their own ways, one to his farm, and another to his merchandise.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the rest laid hands on his servants, and having treated them contumeliously, put them to death.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But when the king had heard of it, he was angry, and sending his armies, he destroyed those murderers, and burnt their city.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then he saith to his servants: The marriage indeed is ready; but they that were invited were not worthy.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Go ye therefore into the highways; and as many as you shall find, call to the marriage.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And his servants going forth into the ways, gathered together all that they found, both bad and good: and the marriage was filled with guests.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And the king went in to see the guests: and he saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And he saith to him: Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? But he was silent.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then the king said to the waiters: Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the exterior darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For many are called, but few are chosen.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then the Pharisees going, consulted among themselves how to insnare him in his speech.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they sent to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying: Master, we know that thou art a true speaker, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou dost not regard the person of men.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Tell us therefore what dost thou think, is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</verse>
  <verse number="18">But Jesus knowing their wickedness, said: Why do you tempt me, ye hypocrites?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Shew me the coin of the tribute. And they offered him a penny.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And Jesus saith to them: Whose image and inscription is this?</verse>
  <verse number="21">They say to him: Caesar’s. Then he saith to them: Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s; and to God, the things that are God’s.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And hearing this they wondered, and leaving him, went their ways.</verse>
  <verse number="23">That day there came to him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and asked him,</verse>
  <verse number="24">Saying: Master, Moses said: If a man die having no son, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up issue to his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first having married a wife, died; and not having issue, left his wife to his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="26">In like manner the second, and the third, and so on to the seventh.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And last of all the woman died also.</verse>
  <verse number="28">At the resurrection therefore whose wife of the seven shall she be? for they all had her.</verse>
  <verse number="29">And Jesus answering, said to them: You err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For in the resurrection they shall neither marry nor be married; but shall be as the angels of God in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken by God, saying to you:</verse>
  <verse number="32">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And the multitudes hearing it, were in admiration at his doctrine.</verse>
  <verse number="34">But the Pharisees hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, came together:</verse>
  <verse number="35">And one of them, a doctor of the law, asking him, tempting him:</verse>
  <verse number="36">Master, which is the greatest commandment in the law?</verse>
  <verse number="37">Jesus said to him: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind.</verse>
  <verse number="38">This is the greatest and the first commandment.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And the second is like to this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</verse>
  <verse number="40">On these two commandments dependeth the whole law and the prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="41">And the Pharisees being gathered together, Jesus asked them,</verse>
  <verse number="42">Saying: What think you of Christ? whose son is he? They say to him: David’s.</verse>
  <verse number="43">He saith to them: How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="44">The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool?</verse>
  <verse number="45">If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?</verse>
  <verse number="46">And no man was able to answer him a word; neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.</verse>
