<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I am the man that has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Surely against me he turns his hand again and again all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">My flesh and my skin has he made old; he has broken my bones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">He has built against me, and surrounded me with gall and travail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He has made me to dwell in dark places, as those that have been long dead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">He has walled me about, that I can’t go forth; he has made my chain heavy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Yes, when I cry, and call for help, he shuts out my prayer.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He has walled up my ways with cut stone; he has made my paths crooked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He is to me as a bear lying in wait, as a lion in secret places.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He has turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces; he has made me desolate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my kidneys.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I am become a derision to all my people, and their song all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He has filled me with bitterness, he has sated me with wormwood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He has also broken my teeth with gravel stones; he has covered me with ashes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">You have removed my soul far off from peace; I forgot prosperity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">I said, My strength is perished, and my expectation from Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Remember my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">My soul still remembers them, and is bowed down within me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">This I recall to my mind; therefore have I hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">It is because of Yahweh’s loving kindnesses that we are not consumed, because his compassion doesn’t fail.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Yahweh is my portion, says my soul; therefore will I hope in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Yahweh is good to those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">It is good that a man should hope and quietly wait for the salvation of Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Let him sit alone and keep silence, because he has laid it on him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Let him put his mouth in the dust, if so be there may be hope.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Let him give his cheek to him who strikes him; let him be filled full with reproach.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For the Lord will not cast off forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">For though he cause grief, yet he will have compassion according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">For he does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the Most High,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord doesn’t approve.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">Who is he who says, and it comes to pass, when the Lord doesn’t command it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">Doesn’t evil and good come out of the mouth of the Most High?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Why does a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Yahweh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">Let us lift up our heart with our hands to God in the heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">We have transgressed and have rebelled; you have not pardoned.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">You have covered with anger and pursued us; you have killed, you have not pitied.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">You have covered yourself with a cloud, so that no prayer can pass through.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">You have made us an off-scouring and refuse in the midst of the peoples.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">Fear and the pit have come on us, devastation and destruction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">My eye runs down with streams of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">My eye pours down, and doesn’t cease, without any intermission,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">Until Yahweh look down, and see from heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">My eye affects my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">They have chased me relentlessly like a bird, those who are my enemies without cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast a stone on me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="55">I called on your name, Yahweh, out of the lowest dungeon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="56">You heard my voice; don’t hide your ear at my breathing, at my cry.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="57">You drew near in the day that I called on you; you said, Don’t be afraid.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="58">Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul; you have redeemed my life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="59">Yahweh, you have seen my wrong. Judge my cause.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="60">You have seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="61">You have heard their reproach, Yahweh, and all their devices against me,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="62">The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="63">You see their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="64">You will render to them a recompense, Yahweh, according to the work of their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="65">You will give them hardness of heart, your curse to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="66">You will pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under the heavens of Yahweh.</p>
