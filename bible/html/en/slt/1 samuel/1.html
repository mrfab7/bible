<div class="chapter" data-book="1 Samuel" data-chapter="1" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And there will be one man from Ramathaim-Zophim, from mount Ephraim, and his name Elkanah, son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And to him two wives; the name of the one Hannah, and the name of the second Peninnah: and there will be to Peninnah children, and to Hannah no children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And this man went up from his city from days to days, to worship and to sacrifice to Jehovah of armies in Shiloh. And there the two sons of Eli, Hophni, and Phinehas, priests to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And the day will be and Elkanah will sacrifice, and he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughter, portions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And to Hannah he will give one portion more, for he loved Hannah; and Jehovah shut up her womb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Being grieved, her distress grieved her so that she was moved because Jehovah shut up about her womb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And so she will do year by year when she went up to the house of Jehovah, so she will be grieved, and she will weep and will not eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And Elkanah her man will say to her, Hannah, why wilt thou weep? and why wilt thou not eat? and why will thy heart break? am I not good to thee above ten sons?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Hannah will rise after eating in Shiloh, and after drinking: (and Eli the priest sat upon the throne by the door-post of the edifice of Jehovah:)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And she bitter of soul, and she will pray to Jehovah, and weeping, she will weep.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And she will vow a vow, and say, Jehovah of armies, if seeing, thou wilt see the affliction of thy servant and remember me, and thou wilt not forget thy servant, and give to thy servant seed of men, and I gave him to Jehovah all the days of his life, and a razor shall not come up upon his head.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And it was when she multiplied to pray before Jehovah, and Eli watched her mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Hannah she speaking upon her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice will not be heard: and Eli will think her to be intoxicated.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And Eli will say to her, How long wilt thou be intoxicated? remove thy wine from thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Hannah will answer and say, No, my lord, I a woman hard of spirit, and wine and strong drink I drank not, and I will pour out my soul before Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Thou wilt not give thy servant before a daughter of Belial, for from the abundance of my complaint and my grief I spoke even till now.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Eli will answer and say, Go with peace: and the God of Israel shall give thine asking which thou didst ask of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And she will say, Thy servant shall find grace in thine eyes. And the woman will go to her way, and ate, and her face is to her no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And they will rise early in the morning and worship before Jehovah, and will turn back and will go to their house to Ramah: and Elkanah will know Hannah his wife, and Jehovah will remember her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And it will be at the return of days Hannah will conceive and bear a son, and she will call his name Samuel, for of Jehovah I asked him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And the man Elkanah and all his house will go up to sacrifice to Jehovah the sacrifice of days, and his vow.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And Hannah went not up; for she said to her husband, Till the boy shall be weaned, and I brought him, and he saw the face of Jehovah, and he shall sit there even to forever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Elkanah her husband will say to her, Do the good in thine eyes; sit till thy weaning him; but Jehovah will raise up his word. And the woman will sit and suckle her son till her weaning him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And she will bring him up with her when she weaned him, with three bullocks and one ephah of flour, and a flask of wine; and she will bring him to the house of Jehovah in Shiloh, and the boy a youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And they will slaughter the bullock, and they will bring the boy to Eli.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And she will say, With leave, my lord, thy soul living, my lord, I the woman standing with thee in here to pray to Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">For this boy I prayed, and Jehovah will give to me my asking which I asked of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And I also lent him to Jehovah; all the days which he lives he is lent to Jehovah. And they will worship to Jehovah there.</p>
