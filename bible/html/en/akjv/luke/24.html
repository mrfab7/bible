<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulcher, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said to them, Why seek you the living among the dead?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke to you when he was yet in Galilee,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And they remembered his words,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And returned from the sepulcher, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, which told these things to the apostles.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Then arose Peter, and ran to the sepulcher; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about three score furlongs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But their eyes were held that they should not know him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And he said to them, What manner of communications are these that you have one to another, as you walk, and are sad?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said to him, Are you only a stranger in Jerusalem, and have not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Yes, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulcher;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulcher, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Then he said to them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And they drew near to the village, where they went: and he made as though he would have gone further.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and broke, and gave to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And as they thus spoke, Jesus himself stood in the middle of them, and said to them, Peace be to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">And he said to them, Why are you troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me have.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have you here any meat?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And he took it, and did eat before them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">And he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">And said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">And you are witnesses of these things.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">And, behold, I send the promise of my Father on you: but tarry you in the city of Jerusalem, until you be endued with power from on high.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</p>
