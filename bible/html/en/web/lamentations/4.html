<p class="verse" data-verse="1">How the gold has become dim! The most pure gold has changed! The stones of the sanctuary are poured out at the head of every street.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, How are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Even the jackals draw out the breast, they nurse their young ones: The daughter of my people has become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The tongue of the nursing child clings to the roof of his mouth for thirst: The young children ask bread, and no man breaks it to them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Those who fed delicately are desolate in the streets: Those who were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the sin of Sodom, That was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands were laid on her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Her nobles were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk; They were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was as of sapphire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Their appearance is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: Their skin clings to their bones; it is withered, it has become like a stick.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Those who are killed with the sword are better than those who are killed with hunger; For these pine away, stricken through, for want of the fruits of the field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">The hands of the pitiful women have boiled their own children; They were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Yahweh has accomplished his wrath, he has poured out his fierce anger; He has kindled a fire in Zion, which has devoured its foundations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">The kings of the earth didn’t believe, neither all the inhabitants of the world, That the adversary and the enemy would enter into the gates of Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">It is because of the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, That have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">They wander as blind men in the streets, they are polluted with blood, So that men can’t touch their garments.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Depart! they cried to them, Unclean! depart, depart, don’t touch! When they fled away and wandered, men said among the nations, They shall not live here any more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">The anger of Yahweh has scattered them; he will no more regard them: They didn’t respect the persons of the priests, they didn’t favor the elders.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Our eyes still fail, looking in vain for our help: In our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">They hunt our steps, so that we can’t go in our streets: Our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end has come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Our pursuers were swifter than the eagles of the sky: They chased us on the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of Yahweh, was taken in their pits; Of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the nations.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Rejoice and be glad, daughter of Edom, that dwell in the land of Uz: The cup shall pass through to you also; you shall be drunken, and shall make yourself naked.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">The punishment of your iniquity is accomplished, daughter of Zion; he will no more carry you away into captivity: He will visit your iniquity, daughter of Edom; he will uncover your sins.</p>
