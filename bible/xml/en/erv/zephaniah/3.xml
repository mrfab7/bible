  <verse number="1">Woe to her that is rebellious and polluted, to the oppressing city!</verse>
  <verse number="2">She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they leave nothing till the morrow.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have profaned the sanctuary, they have done violence to the law.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The LORD in the midst of her is righteous; he will not do iniquity; every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I have cut off nations, their battlements are desolate; I have made their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none inhabitant.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive correction; so her dwelling should not be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her: but they rose early and corrupted all their doings.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Therefore wait ye for me, saith the LORD, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, even all my fierce anger; for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For then will I turn to the peoples a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one consent.</verse>
  <verse number="10">From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.</verse>
  <verse number="11">In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will take away out of the midst of thee thy proudly exulting ones, and thou shalt no more be haughty in my holy mountain.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But I will leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of thee: thou shalt not fear evil any more.</verse>
  <verse number="16">In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: O Zion, let not thine hands be slack.</verse>
  <verse number="17">The LORD thy God is in the midst of thee, a mighty one who will save: he will rejoice over thee with joy, he will rest in his love, he will joy over thee with singing.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I will gather them that sorrow for the solemn assembly, who were of thee: to whom the burden upon her was a reproach.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Behold, at that time I will deal with all them that afflict thee: and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven away; and I will make them a praise and a name, whose shame hath been in all the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="20">At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I bring again your captivity before your eyes, saith the LORD.</verse>
