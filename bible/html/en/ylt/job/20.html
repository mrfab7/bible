<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Zophar the Naamathite answereth and saith:—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Therefore my thoughts cause me to answer, And because of my sensations in me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The chastisement of my shame I hear, And the spirit of mine understanding Doth cause me to answer:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">This hast thou known from antiquity? Since the placing of man on earth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">That the singing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the profane for a moment,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Though his excellency go up to the heavens, And his head against a cloud he strike—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">As his own dung for ever he doth perish, His beholders say: ‘Where is he?’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">As a dream he fleeth, and they find him not, And he is driven away as a vision of the night,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The eye hath not seen him, and addeth not. And not again doth his place behold him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">His sons do the poor oppress, And his hands give back his wealth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">His bones have been full of his youth, And with him on the dust it lieth down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Though he doth sweeten evil in his mouth, Doth hide it under his tongue,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Hath pity on it, and doth not forsake it, And keep it back in the midst of his palate,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">His food in his bowels is turned, The bitterness of asps is in his heart.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Wealth he hath swallowed, and doth vomit it. From his belly God driveth it out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Gall of asps he sucketh, Slay him doth the tongue of a viper.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">He looketh not on rivulets, Flowing of brooks of honey and butter.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He is giving back what he laboured for, And doth not consume it; As a bulwark is his exchange, and he exults not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For he oppressed—he forsook the poor, A house he hath taken violently away, And he doth not build it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">For he hath not known ease in his belly. With his desirable thing he delivereth not himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">There is not a remnant to his food, Therefore his good doth not stay.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">In the fulness of his sufficiency he is straitened. Every perverse hand doth meet him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">It cometh to pass, at the filling of his belly, He sendeth forth against him The fierceness of His anger, Yea, He raineth on him in his eating.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He fleeth from an iron weapon, Pass through him doth a bow of brass.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">One hath drawn, And it cometh out from the body, And a glittering weapon from his gall proceedeth. On him are terrors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">All darkness is hid for his treasures, Consume him doth a fire not blown, Broken is the remnant in his tent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Reveal do the heavens his iniquity, And earth is raising itself against him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Remove doth the increase of his house, Poured forth in a day of His anger.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">This is the portion of a wicked man from God. And an inheritance appointed him by God.</p>
