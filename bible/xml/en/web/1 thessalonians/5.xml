<chapter book="1 Thessalonians" number="5" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that anything be written to you.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For you yourselves know well that the day of the Lord comes like a thief in the night.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For when they are saying, “Peace and safety,” then sudden destruction will come on them, like birth pains on a pregnant woman; and they will in no way escape.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But you, brothers, aren’t in darkness, that the day should overtake you like a thief.</verse>
  <verse number="5">You are all children of light, and children of the day. We don’t belong to the night, nor to darkness,</verse>
  <verse number="6">so then let’s not sleep, as the rest do, but let’s watch and be sober.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For those who sleep, sleep in the night, and those who are drunk are drunk in the night.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But let us, since we belong to the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and, for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For God didn’t appoint us to wrath, but to the obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
  <verse number="10">who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Therefore exhort one another, and build each other up, even as you also do.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But we beg you, brothers, to know those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you,</verse>
  <verse number="13">and to respect and honor them in love for their work’s sake. Be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
  <verse number="14">We exhort you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, encourage the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient toward all.</verse>
  <verse number="15">See that no one returns evil for evil to anyone, but always follow after that which is good, for one another, and for all.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Rejoice always.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Pray without ceasing.</verse>
  <verse number="18">In everything give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Don’t quench the Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Don’t despise prophesies.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Test all things, and hold firmly that which is good.</verse>
  <verse number="22">Abstain from every form of evil.</verse>
  <verse number="23">May the God of peace himself sanctify you completely. May your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He who calls you is faithful, who will also do it.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Brothers, pray for us.</verse>
  <verse number="26">Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</verse>
  <verse number="27">I solemnly command you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the holy brothers.</verse>
  <verse number="28">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.</verse>
