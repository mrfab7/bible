  <verse number="1">Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves’ eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; all of which bear twins, and none is barren among them.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of pomegranate within thy locks.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thy neck is like the tower of David built for an armory, on which hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Until the day shall break, and the shadows flee away, I will repair to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions’ dens, from the mountains of the leopards.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thy eyes, with one chain of thy neck.</verse>
  <verse number="10">How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thy ointments than all spices!</verse>

  <verse number="12">A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphor, with spikenard,</verse>
  <verse number="14">Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:</verse>
  <verse number="15">A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that its spices may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.</verse>
