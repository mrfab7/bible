  <verse number="1">My brothers, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Behold, we put bits in the horses’ mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, wherever the governor wants.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasts great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindles!</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed of mankind:</verse>
  <verse number="8">But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not so to be.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Does a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?</verse>
  <verse number="12">Can the fig tree, my brothers, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="15">This wisdom descends not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.</verse>
  <verse number="17">But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.</verse>
