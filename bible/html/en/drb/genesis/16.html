<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Now Sarai the wife of Abram, had brought forth no children; having a handmaid, an Egyptian, named Agar,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">She said to her husband: Behold, the Lord hath restrained me from bearing: go in unto my handmaid, it may be I may have children of her at least. And when he agreed to her request,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">She took Agar the Egyptian her handmaid, ten years after they first dwelt in the land of Chanaan, and gave her to her husband to wife.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And he went in to her. But she, perceiving that she was with child, despised her mistress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And Sarai said to Abram: Thou dost unjustly with me: I gave my handmaid into thy bosom, and she perceiving herself to be with child, despiseth me. The Lord judge between me and thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Abram made answer, and said to her: Behold thy handmaid is in thy own hand, use her its it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai afflicted her, she ran away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And the angel of the Lord having found her, by a fountain of water in the wilderness, which is in the way to Sur in the desert,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He said to her: Agar, handmaid of Sarai, whence comest thou? and whither goest thou? And she answered: I flee from the face of Sarai, my mistress.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And the angel of the Lord said to her: Return to thy mistress, and humble thyself under her hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And again he said: I will multiply thy seed exceedingly, and it shall not be numbered for multitude.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And again: Behold, said he, thou art with child, and thou shalt bring forth a son: and thou shalt call his name Ismael, because the Lord hath heard thy affliction.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">He shall be a wild man: his hand will be against all men, and all menâ€™s hands against him: and he shall pitch his tents over against all his brethren.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And she called the name of the Lord that spoke unto her: Thou the God who hast seen me. For she said: Verily here have I seen the hinder parts of him that seeth me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Therefore she called that well, The well of him that liveth and seeth me. The same is between Cades and Bared.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Agar brought forth a son to Abram: who called his name Ismael.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Abram was fourscore and six years old when Agar brought him forth Ismael.</p>
