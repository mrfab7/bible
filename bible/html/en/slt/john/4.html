<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees heard that Jesus makes and baptizes more disciples than John,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">(Though Jesus himself immersed not, but his disciples,)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And it was necessary for him to pass through Samaria.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then comes he to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the place which Jacob gave to Joseph his son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Jacob’s spring was there. Then Jesus, wearied with the journey, sat thus by the spring: it was about the sixth hour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">A woman of Samaria comes to draw water: Jesus says to her, Give me to drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">(For his disciples were gone into the city that they might buy food.)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Then says the Samaritan woman to him, How thou, being a Jew, askest of me to drink, being a Samaritan woman? for the Jews have no intercourse with the Samaritans.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Jesus answered and said to her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who he is saying to thee, Give me to drink: thou hadst asked him, and he had given thee living water.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The woman says to him, Lord, thou hast no vessel for drawing, and the well is deep; whence then hast thou the living water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Thou art not greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and he himself drank of it, and his sons, and his young animals.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Jesus answered and said to her, All drinking of this water shall thirst again:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">But whoever should drink of the water which I shall give him, shall never thirst; but the water which I shall give him shall be in him a spring of water springing up to eternal life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">The woman says to him, Lord, give me this water, that I thirst not, nor come here to draw.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Jesus says to her, Retire, call thy husband, and come here.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus says to her, Thou sayest well, That I have no husband:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For thou hadst five husbands; and now he whom thou hast is not thy husband: this thou saidst true.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The woman says to him, Lord, I see that thou art a prophet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Our fathers worshipped in this mount; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where they must worship.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Jesus says to her, Woman, believe me, that the hour comes, when neither in this mount, neither in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Ye worship what ye know not: we worship what we know: for salvation is of the Jews.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth; for also the Father seeks such worshipping him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">God a Spirit: and they worshipping him must worship in spirit and truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The woman says to him, I know that Messias comes, called Christ: when he should come, he will announce all things to us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">Jesus says to her, I am he speaking to thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And upon this his disciples came, and they wondered that he spake with the woman: yet none said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">The woman then left her water buckets and departed to the city, and says to the men,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Come, see a man, who told me all which I ever did: is not this Christ?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Then went they forth out of the city, and came to him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And in the mean time the disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And he said to them, I have food to eat which ye know not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Then said the disciples to one another, Has any one brought him to eat?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Jesus says to them, My food is that I might do the will of him having sent me, and finish his work.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Say ye not, That there is yet the fourth month, and harvest comes? behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes, and behold the countries; for they are already white for harvest.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">And he reaping receives wages, and gathers fruit to eternal life: that he sowing might rejoice together and he reaping.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">For in this the word is true, That one is sowing, and another reaping.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">I sent you to reap that with which ye have not been wearied: some have been wearied, and others have come into their labor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in him for the woman’s word testifying, That he told me all which I ever did.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">When therefore the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to remain with them: and he remained there two days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="41">And many more believed on account of his word;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="42">And they said to the woman, That we no more believe for thy speaking: for we ourselves have heard and know, that this is truly Christ, the Saviour of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="43">And after two days he came out thence, and departed to Galilee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="44">For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet has no honour in his own country.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="45">When therefore he came to Galilee, the Galileans received him, having seen all which he did in Jerusalem in the festival: for they also came to the festival.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="46">Then came Jesus again to Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain royal one, whose son was sick in Capernaum.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="47">He, having heard that Jesus was come from Judea to Galilee, went away to him, and asked him that he would go down and heal his son: for he was about to die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="48">Then said Jesus to him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye would not believe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="49">The royal one says to Him, Lord, go down before my child dies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="50">Jesus says to him, Go; thy son lives. And the man believed the word which Jesus said to him, and he went.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="51">And he already going down, his servants met him, and announced, saying, That thy child lives.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="52">Then he inquired of them the hour in which he was attended to. And they said to him, That yesterday the seventh hour the fever left him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="53">Then the father knew that in that hour in which Jesus said to him, That thy son lives: and he believed, and his whole house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="54">This second sign Jesus did, having come out of Judea into Galilee.</p>
