<chapter book="1 Timothy" number="4" translation="Darby Bible Translation" translationID="dbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">But the Spirit speaks expressly, that in latter times some shall apostatise from the faith, giving their mind to deceiving spirits and teachings of demons</verse>
  <verse number="2">speaking lies in hypocrisy, cauterised as to their own conscience,</verse>
  <verse number="3">forbidding to marry, [bidding] to abstain from meats, which God has created for receiving with thanksgiving for them who are faithful and know the truth.</verse>
  <verse number="4">For every creature of God [is] good, and nothing [is] to be rejected, being received with thanksgiving;</verse>
  <verse number="5">for it is sanctified by God’s word and freely addressing [him].</verse>
  <verse number="6">Laying these things before the brethren, thou wilt be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which thou hast fully followed up.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But profane and old wives’ fables avoid, but exercise thyself unto piety;</verse>
  <verse number="8">for bodily exercise is profitable for a little, but piety is profitable for everything, having promise of life, of the present one, and of that to come.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The word [is] faithful and worthy of all acceptation;</verse>
  <verse number="10">for, for this we labour and suffer reproach, because we hope in a living God, who is preserver of all men, specially of those that believe.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Enjoin and teach these things.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Let no one despise thy youth, but be a model of the believers, in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Till I come, give thyself to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Be not negligent of the gift [that is] in thee, which has been given to thee through prophecy, with imposition of the hands of the elderhood.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Occupy thyself with these things; be wholly in them, that thy progress may be manifest to all.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Give heed to thyself and to the teaching; continue in them; for, doing this, thou shalt save both thyself and those that hear thee.</verse>
