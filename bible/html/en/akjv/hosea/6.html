<div class="chapter" data-book="Hosea" data-chapter="6" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Come, and let us return to the LORD: for he has torn, and he will heal us; he has smitten, and he will bind us up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come to us as the rain, as the latter and former rain to the earth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">O Ephraim, what shall I do to you? O Judah, what shall I do to you? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goes away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and your judgments are as the light that goes forth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the prostitution of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Also, O Judah, he has set an harvest for you, when I returned the captivity of my people.</p>
