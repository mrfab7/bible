<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="34" data-translation="Smith's Literal Translation" data-translation-id="slt" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Elihu will answer and say,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Hear, ye wise, my words; and ye knowing, give ear to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the ear will try words, and the palate will taste of food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">We will choose to us judgment: we shall know between ourselves what is good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For Job said, I was just: and God removed my judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Shall I speak falsehood against my judgment? mine arrow was desperate without transgression.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">What man as Job he will drink scoffing as water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Going for company with those working iniquity, and to go with men of injustice?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For he said, It will not profit a man in delighting himself with God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">For this, ye men of heart, hear to me: far be it to God from doing evil; and the Almighty from iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For the work of man shall he recompense to him, and a man shall find himself according to his way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Also surely God will not do evil, and the Almighty will not pervert judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Who committed to him the earth? and who set up the habitable globe all of it?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">If he will set his heart to him, he will gather his spirit and his breath to him;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">All flesh shall expire together, and man shall turn back to dust.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If now understanding, hear this: give ear to the voice of my words.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Also shall he hating judgment, rule? and if thou wilt condemn the just mighty one?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Saying to the king, Wickedness; (Belial) to nobles, Injustice.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Who accepted not the face of chiefs, and looked not upon the rich one before the poor: for his hand made all of them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">In a moment shall they die, and the middle of the night shall the people be moved and pass away: and the mighty shall be removed with not a hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he will see all his steps.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Not darkness and not the shadow of death for those working iniquity to hide there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For he will not yet set upon man to go to God in judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He shall break in pieces the mighty, not searching out, and he will set others in their stead.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">For this he will know their work, and he turned the night, and they will be crushed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He struck them for the unjust in the place of those seeing;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Who therefore turned away from after him, and they consider not all his ways,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">To cause the cry of the poor one to come to him, and he will hear the cry of the humble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And he will give quiet, and who shall disturb? and he will hide the face, and who shall look upon him? and against a nation and against man wholly:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">From the reigning of the profane man from the people being snared.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">For he said to God, I was lifted up, I will pervert no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">Besides I shall see thou wilt teach it to me: if I did iniquity, I will not add.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">Is it with thee? he will requite it, if thou didst refuse, if thou shalt choose, and not I: and what thou knewest, speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">Men of heart will say to me, and a wise man heard to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Job will speak not with knowledge, and his word not with understanding.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">My father, Job shall be tried even to the end, for turning back with men of iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">He will add rebellion to his sin; he will clap between us, and he will multiply his words to God.</p>
