<p class="verse" data-verse="1">On my bed, in the nights, I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I will rise now, and go about the city; In the streets and in the broadways Will I seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">The watchmen that go about the city found me:—Have ye seen him whom my soul loveth?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">—Scarcely had I passed from them, When I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, Until I had brought him into my mother’s house, And into the chamber of her that conceived me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">I charge you, daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles, or by the hinds of the field, That ye stir not up, nor awake [my] love, till he please.</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Go forth, daughters of Zion, And behold king Solomon With the crown wherewith his mother crowned him In the day of his espousals, And in the day of the gladness of his heart.</p>
