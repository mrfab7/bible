<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="4" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">In that day seven women will take hold of one man and say, “We will eat our own bread and provide our own clothes. Just let us be called by your name. Take away our disgrace!”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">On that day the Branch of the LORD will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of Israel’s survivors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Whoever remains in Zion and whoever is left in Jerusalem will be called holy—all in Jerusalem who are recorded among the living—</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">when the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed the bloodstains from the heart of Jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then the LORD will create over all of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud of smoke by day and a glowing flame of fire by night. For over all the glory there will be a canopy,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">a shelter to give shade from the heat by day, and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and the rain.</p>
