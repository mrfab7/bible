  <verse number="1">And Jesus answered and spake again in parables unto them, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a certain king, which made a marriage feast for his son,</verse>
  <verse number="3">and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the marriage feast: and they would not come.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Again he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them that are bidden, Behold, I have made ready my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come to the marriage feast.</verse>
  <verse number="5">But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise:</verse>
  <verse number="6">and the rest laid hold on his servants, and entreated them shamefully, and killed them.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But the king was wroth; and he sent his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned their city.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they that were bidden were not worthy.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Go ye therefore unto the partings of the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage feast.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was filled with guests.</verse>
  <verse number="11">But when the king came in to behold the guests, he saw there a man which had not on a wedding-garment:</verse>
  <verse number="12">and he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding-garment? And he was speechless.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Then the king said to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and cast him out into the outer darkness; there shall be the weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
  <verse number="14">For many are called, but few chosen.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might ensnare him in his talk.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And they send to him their disciples, with the Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God in truth, and carest not for any one: for thou regardest not the person of men.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar, or not?</verse>
  <verse number="18">But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?</verse>
  <verse number="21">They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And when they heard it, they marveled, and left him, and went their way.</verse>
  <verse number="23">On that day there came to him Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection: and they asked him,</verse>
  <verse number="24">saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first married and deceased, and having no seed left his wife unto his brother;</verse>
  <verse number="26">in like manner the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.</verse>
  <verse number="27">And after them all the woman died.</verse>
  <verse number="28">In the resurrection therefore whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.</verse>
  <verse number="29">But Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="31">But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="32">I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</verse>
  <verse number="33">And when the multitudes heard it, they were astonished at his teaching.</verse>
  <verse number="34">But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered themselves together.</verse>
  <verse number="35">And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him,</verse>
  <verse number="36">Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</verse>
  <verse number="37">And he said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</verse>
  <verse number="38">This is the great and first commandment.</verse>
  <verse number="39">And a second like unto it is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</verse>
  <verse number="40">On these two commandments hangeth the whole law, and the prophets.</verse>
  <verse number="41">Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question,</verse>
  <verse number="42">saying, What think ye of the Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David.</verse>
  <verse number="43">He saith unto them, How then doth David in the Spirit call him Lord, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="44">The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, Till I put thine enemies underneath thy feet?</verse>
  <verse number="45">If David then calleth him Lord, how is he his son?</verse>
  <verse number="46">And no one was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.</verse>
