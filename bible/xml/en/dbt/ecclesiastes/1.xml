  <verse number="1">The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities! all is vanity.</verse>
  <verse number="3">What profit hath man of all his labour wherewith he laboureth under the sun?</verse>
  <verse number="4">[One] generation passeth away, and [another] generation cometh, but the earth standeth for ever.</verse>
  <verse number="5">The sun also riseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to its place where it ariseth.</verse>
  <verse number="6">The wind goeth towards the south, and turneth about towards the north: it turneth about continually, and the wind returneth again to its circuits.</verse>
  <verse number="7">All the rivers run into the sea, yet the sea is not full: unto the place whither the rivers go, thither they go again.</verse>
  <verse number="8">All things are full of toil; none can express it. The eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</verse>
  <verse number="9">That which hath been is that which shall be; and that which hath been done is that which will be done: and there is nothing new under the sun.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Is there a thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? It hath been already in the ages which were before us.</verse>
  <verse number="11">There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be remembrance of things that are to come with those who shall live afterwards.</verse>
  <verse number="12">I, the Preacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="13">And I applied my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all that is done under the heavens: this grievous occupation hath God given to the children of men to weary themselves therewith.</verse>
  <verse number="14">I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and behold, all is vanity and pursuit of the wind.</verse>
  <verse number="15">That which is crooked cannot be made straight; and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</verse>
  <verse number="16">I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I have become great and have acquired wisdom more than all they that have been before me over Jerusalem; and my heart hath seen much of wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
  <verse number="17">And I applied my heart to the knowledge of wisdom, and to the knowledge of madness and folly: I perceived that this also is a striving after the wind.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For in much wisdom is much vexation, and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</verse>
