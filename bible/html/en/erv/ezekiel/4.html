<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and pourtray upon it a city, even Jerusalem:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast up a mount against it; set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it round about.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And take thou unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face toward it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Moreover lie thou upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be unto thee a number of days, even three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And again, when thou hast accomplished these, thou shalt lie on thy right side, and shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah: forty days, each day for a year, have I appointed it unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with thine arm uncovered; and thou shalt prophesy against it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And, behold, I lay bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast accomplished the days of thy siege.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Take thou also unto thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof; according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, even three hundred and ninety days, shalt thou eat thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And thy meat which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And thou shalt drink water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it in their sight with dung that cometh out of man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations whither I will drive them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn of beasts; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Then he said unto me, See, I have given thee cow’s dung for man’s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with carefulness; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">that they may want bread and water, and be astonied one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.</p>
