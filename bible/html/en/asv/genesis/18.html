<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah appeared unto him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood over against him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">and said, My lord, if now I have found favor in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">let now a little water be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and I will fetch a morsel of bread, and strengthen ye your heart; after that ye shall pass on: forasmuch as ye are come to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetched a calf tender and good, and gave it unto the servant; and he hasted to dress it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And he said, I will certainly return unto thee when the season cometh round; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Now Abraham and Sarah were old, and well stricken in age; it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">And Jehovah said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, who am old?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Is anything too hard for Jehovah? At the set time I will return unto thee, when the season cometh round, and Sarah shall have a son.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And Jehovah said, Shall I hide from Abraham that which I do;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For I have known him, to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of Jehovah, to do righteousness and justice; to the end that Jehovah may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And Jehovah said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">And the men turned from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou consume the righteous with the wicked?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou consume and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from thee: shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">And Jehovah said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I find there forty and five.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for the forty’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the twenty’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten’s sake.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And Jehovah went his way, as soon as he had left off communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</p>
