<chapter book="Hebrews" number="7" translation="Young's Literal Translation" translationID="ylt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">For this Melchisedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who did meet Abraham turning back from the smiting of the kings, and did bless him,</verse>
  <verse number="2">to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide, (first, indeed, being interpreted, ‘King of righteousness,’ and then also, King of Salem, which is, King of Peace,)</verse>
  <verse number="3">without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, and being made like to the Son of God, doth remain a priest continually.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And see how great this one is, to whom also a tenth Abraham the patriarch did give out of the best of the spoils,</verse>
  <verse number="5">and those, indeed, out of the sons of Levi receiving the priesthood, a command have to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, their brethren, even though they came forth out of the loins of Abraham;</verse>
  <verse number="6">and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them, received tithes from Abraham, and him having the promises he hath blessed,</verse>
  <verse number="7">and apart from all controversy, the less by the better is blessed—</verse>
  <verse number="8">and here, indeed, men who die do receive tithes, and there he, who is testified to that he was living,</verse>
  <verse number="9">and so to speak, through Abraham even Levi who is receiving tithes, hath paid tithes,</verse>
  <verse number="10">for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek met him.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If indeed, then, perfection were through the Levitical priesthood—for the people under it had received law—what further need, according to the order of Melchisedek, for another priest to arise, and not to be called according to the order of Aaron?</verse>
  <verse number="12">for the priesthood being changed, of necessity also, of the law a change doth come,</verse>
  <verse number="13">for he of whom these things are said in another tribe hath had part, of whom no one gave attendance at the altar,</verse>
  <verse number="14">for it is evident that out of Judah hath arisen our Lord, in regard to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</verse>
  <verse number="15">And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to the similitude of Melchisedek there doth arise another priest,</verse>
  <verse number="16">who came not according to the law of a fleshly command, but according to the power of an endless life,</verse>
  <verse number="17">for He doth testify—‘Thou art a priest—to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;’</verse>
  <verse number="18">for a disannulling indeed doth come of the command going before because of its weakness, and unprofitableness,</verse>
  <verse number="19">(for nothing did the law perfect) and the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw nigh to God.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And inasmuch as it is not apart from oath, (for those indeed apart from oath are become priests,</verse>
  <verse number="21">and he with an oath through Him who is saying unto him, ‘The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou art a priest—to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;’)</verse>
  <verse number="22">by so much of a better covenant hath Jesus become surety,</verse>
  <verse number="23">and those indeed are many who have become priests, because by death they are hindered from remaining;</verse>
  <verse number="24">and he, because of his remaining—to the age, hath the priesthood not transient,</verse>
  <verse number="25">whence also he is able to save to the very end, those coming through him unto God—ever living to make intercession for them.</verse>
  <verse number="26">For such a chief priest did become us—kind, harmless, undefiled, separate from the sinners, and become higher than the heavens,</verse>
  <verse number="27">who hath no necessity daily, as the chief priests, first for his own sins to offer up sacrifice, then for those of the people; for this he did once, having offered up himself;</verse>
  <verse number="28">for the law doth appoint men chief priests, having infirmity, but the word of the oath that is after the law appointeth the Son—to the age having been perfected.</verse>
