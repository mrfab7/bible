<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="5" data-translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" data-translation-id="jps" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My son, attend unto my wisdom; Incline thine ear to my understanding;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">That thou mayest preserve discretion, And that thy lips may keep knowledge.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And her mouth is smoother than oil;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">But her end is bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a two-edged sword.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Her feet go down to death; Her steps take hold on the nether-world;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Lest she should walk the even path of life, Her ways wander, but she knoweth it not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Now therefore, O ye children, hearken unto me, And depart not from the words of my mouth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Remove thy way far from her, And come not nigh the door of her house;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Lest thou give thy vigour unto others, And thy years unto the cruel;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, And thy labours be in the house of an alien;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And thou moan, when thine end cometh, When thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And say: ‘How have I hated instruction, And my heart despised reproof;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Neither have I hearkened to the voice of my teachers, Nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">I was well nigh in all evil In the midst of the congregation and assembly.’</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Drink waters out of thine own cistern, And running waters out of thine own well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Let thy springs be dispersed abroad, And courses of water in the streets.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Let them be only thine own, And not strangers’ with thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Let thy fountain be blessed; And have joy of the wife of thy youth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">A lovely hind and a graceful doe, Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; With her love be thou ravished always.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Why then wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, And embrace the bosom of an alien?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, And He maketh even all his paths.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">His own iniquities shall ensnare the wicked, And he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He shall die for lack of instruction; And in the greatness of his folly he shall reel.</p>
