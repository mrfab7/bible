<chapter book="Ezekiel" number="15" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
  <verse number="2">Son of man, what is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devours both the ends of it, and the middle of it is burned. Is it meet for any work?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned?</verse>
  <verse number="6">Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="7">And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and you shall know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, said the Lord GOD.</verse>
