<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">He sets an end to darkness, and searches out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">The flood breaks out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">As for the earth, out of it comes bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it has dust of gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">There is a path which no fowl knows, and which the vulture’s eye has not seen:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">The lion’s whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">He puts forth his hand on the rock; he overturns the mountains by the roots.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He cuts out rivers among the rocks; and his eye sees every precious thing.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">He binds the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid brings he forth to light.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Man knows not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">The depth said, It is not in me: and the sea said, It is not with me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">From where then comes wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">God understands the way thereof, and he knows the place thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">For he looks to the ends of the earth, and sees under the whole heaven;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">To make the weight for the winds; and he weighs the waters by measure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yes, and searched it out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">And to man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.</p>
