<chapter book="Job" number="9" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">And Job answered, and said:</verse>
  <verse number="2">Indeed I know it is so, and that man cannot be justified compared with</verse>
  <verse number="3">If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one for a thousand.</verse>
  <verse number="4">He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath resisted him, and hath had peace ?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Who hath removed mountains, and they whom he overthrew in his wrath, knew it not.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Who shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Who commandeth tile sun and it riseth not: and shutteth up the stars as it were under a seal:</verse>
  <verse number="8">Who alone spreadeth out the heavens, and walketh upon the waves of the sea.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Who maketh Arcturus, and Orion, and Hyades, and the inner parts of the south.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Who doth things great and incomprehensible, and wonderful, of which there is no number.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If he come to me, I shall not see him: if he depart I shall not understand.</verse>
  <verse number="12">If he examine on a sudden, who shall answer him? or who can say: Why dost thou so?</verse>
  <verse number="13">God, whose wrath no man can resist, and under whom they stoop that bear up the world.</verse>
  <verse number="14">What am I then, that I should answer him, and have words with him?</verse>
  <verse number="15">I, who although I should have any just thing, would not answer, but would make supplication to my judge.</verse>
  <verse number="16">And if he should hear me when I call, I should not believe that he had heard my voice.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For he shall crush me in a whirlwind, and multiply my wounds even without cause.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He alloweth not my spirit to rest, and he filleth me with bitterness.</verse>
  <verse number="19">If strength be demanded, he is most strong: if equity of judgment, no man dare bear witness for me.</verse>
  <verse number="20">If I would justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me: if I would shew myself innocent, he shall prove me wicked.</verse>
  <verse number="21">Although I should be simple, even this my soul shall be ignorant of, and I shall be weary of my life.</verse>
  <verse number="22">One thing there is that I have spoken, both the innocent and the wicked he consumeth.</verse>
  <verse number="23">If he scourge, let him kill at once, and not laugh at the pains of the innocent.</verse>
  <verse number="24">The earth is given into the hand of the wicked, he covereth the face of the judges thereof: and if it be not he, who is it then?</verse>
  <verse number="25">My days have been swifter than a post: they have fled away and have not seen good.</verse>
  <verse number="26">They have passed by as ships carrying fruits, as an eagle flying to the prey.</verse>
  <verse number="27">If I say: I will not speak so: I change my face, and am tormented with sorrow.</verse>
  <verse number="28">I feared all my works, knowing that thou didst not spare the offender.</verse>
  <verse number="29">But if so also I am wicked, why have I laboured in vain?</verse>
  <verse number="30">If I be washed as it were with snow waters, and my hands shall shine ever so clean :</verse>
  <verse number="31">Yet thou shalt plunge me in filth, and my garments shall abhor me,</verse>
  <verse number="32">For I shall not answer a man that is like myself: nor one that may be heard with me equally in judgment.</verse>
  <verse number="33">There is none that may be able to reprove both, and to put his hand between both.</verse>
  <verse number="34">Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me.</verse>
  <verse number="35">I will speak, and will not fear him: for I cannot answer while I am in fear.</verse>
