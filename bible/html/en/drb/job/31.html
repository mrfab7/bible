<div class="chapter" data-book="Job" data-chapter="31" data-translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" data-translation-id="drb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">I made a covenant with my eyes, that I would not so much as think upon a virgin.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For what part should God from above have in me, and what inheritance the Almighty from on high?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Is not destruction to the wicked, and aversion to them that work iniquity?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Doth not he consider my ways, and number all my steps?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If I have walked in vanity, and my foot hath made haste to deceit:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Let him weigh me in a just balance, and let God know my simplicity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">If my step hath turned out of the way, and if my heart hath followed my eyes, and if a spot hath cleaved to my hands:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Then let me sow and let another eat: and let my offspring be rooted out.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">If my heart hath been deceived upon a woman, and if I have laid wait at my friend’s door:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Let my wife be the harlot of another, and let other men lie with her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For this is a heinous crime, and a most grievous iniquity.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">It is a fire that devoureth even to destruction, and rooteth up all things that spring.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">If I have despised to abide judgment with my manservant, or my maidservant, when they had any controversy against me:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">For what shall I do when God shall rise to judge? and when he shall examine, what shall I answer him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Did not he that made me in the womb make him also: and did not one and the same form me in the womb?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">If I have denied to the poor what they desired, and have made the eyes of the widow wait:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">If I have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">(For from my infancy mercy grew up with me: and it came out with me from my mother’s womb :)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">If I have despised him that was perishing for want of clothing, and the poor man that had no covering:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">If his sides have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, even when I saw myself superior in the gate:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Let my shoulder fall from its joint, and let my arm with its bones be broken.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">For I have always feared God as waves swelling over me, and his weight I was not able to bear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">If I have thought gold my strength, and have said to fine gold: My confidence:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">If I have rejoiced over my great riches, and because my hand had gotten much.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">If I beheld the sun when it shined, and the moon going in brightness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">And my heart in secret hath rejoiced, and I have kissed my hand with my mouth:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Which is a very great iniquity, and a denial against the most high God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">If I have been glad at the downfall of him that hated me, and have rejoiced that evil had found him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">For I have not given my mouth to sin, by wishing a curse to his soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">If the men of my tabernacle have not said: Who will give us of his flesh that we may be filled?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">The stranger did not stay without, my door was open to the traveller.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">If as a man I have hid my sin, and have concealed my iniquity in my bosom.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">If I have been afraid at a very great multitude, and the contempt of kinsmen hath terrified me: and I have not rather held my peace, and not gone out of the door.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">Who would grant me a hearer, that the Almighty may hear my desire; and that he himself that judgeth would write a book,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">That I may carry it on my shoulder, and put it about me as a crown?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">At every step of mine I would pronounce it, and offer it as to a prince.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">If my land cry against me, and with it the furrows thereof mourn:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, and have afflicted the soul of the tillers thereof:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="40">Let thistles grow up to me instead of wheat, and thorns instead of barley.</p>
