<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Ask of Jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain; Jehovah will make lightnings, and he will give them showers of rain, to every one grass in the field.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a lie, and have told false dreams: they comfort in vain. Therefore they have gone away as a flock, they are in distress, because there is no shepherd.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Mine anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will punish the he-goats; for Jehovah of hosts visiteth his flock, the house of Judah, and maketh them as his majestic horse in the battle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">From him shall come forth the corner-stone, from him the nail, from him the battle bow, from him every exactor together.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And they shall be as mighty men, treading down the mire of the streets in the battle; and they shall fight, for Jehovah is with them, and the riders on horses shall be put to shame.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph, and I will bring them back again; for I will have mercy upon them; and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am Jehovah their God, and I will answer them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And [they of] Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their hearts shall rejoice as through wine; and their children shall see [it], and rejoice; their heart shall be joyful in Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed them: and they shall multiply as they used to multiply.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And I will sow them among the peoples, and they shall remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their children and return.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And I will bring them again out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and [place] shall not be found for them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And he shall pass through the sea of affliction, and shall smite the billows in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall dry up; and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And I will strengthen them in Jehovah; and they shall walk in his name, saith Jehovah.</p>
