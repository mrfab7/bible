<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And Jehovah will speak to Moses, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Speak to the sons of Israel, and take from them a rod, a rod according to the house of the father, from all the chiefs according to the house of their fathers, twelve rods: thou shalt write each his name upon his rod.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And Aaron’s name shalt thou write upon the rod of Levi: for one rod is for the head of the house of their fathers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">And place them in the tent of appointment before the testimony, where I will pass over to you there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">And it was the man whom I shall desire him, his rod shall be fruitful: and I caused to cease from me the murmurings of the sons of Israel which they are murmuring against you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And Moses will speak to the sons of Israel, and all their chiefs will give to him a rod for one chief, a rod for one chief, according to the house of their fathers, twelve rods: and Aaron’s rod in the midst of their rods.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And Moses will place the rods before Jehovah in the tent of testimony.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">And it shall be on the morrow, and Moses will go into the tent of testimony; and behold, Aaron’s rod was fruitful for the house of Levi, and the blossom will come forth and the flower will flourish and will show almonds.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">And Moses will bring forth all the rods from before Jehovah to all the sons of Israel: and they shall see and shall take each his rod.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And Jehovah will say to Moses, Turn back Aaron’s rod before the testimony, for preservation, for a sign for the sons of contradiction; and thou shalt finish their murmurings from me, and they shall not die.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And Moses will do: as Jehovah commanded him, so did he.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And the sons of Israel will speak to Moses, saying, Behold, we expired, we perished, we all perished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">All coming near, coming near the dwelling of Jehovah, and dying, shall die: shall we die to breathe out life?</p>
