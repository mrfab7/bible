  <verse number="1">Now about the collection for the saints, you are to do as I directed the churches of Galatia:</verse>
  <verse number="2">On the first day of every week, each of you should set aside a portion of his income, saving it up, so that when I come no collections will be needed.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Then, on my arrival, I will send letters with those you recommend to carry your gift to Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And if it is advisable for me to go also, they can travel with me.</verse>
  <verse number="5">After I go through Macedonia, however, I will come to you; for I will be going through Macedonia.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Perhaps I will stay with you awhile, or even spend the winter, so that you can help me on my journey, wherever I go.</verse>
  <verse number="7">For I do not want to see you now only in passing; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,</verse>
  <verse number="9">because a great door for effective work has opened to me, even though many oppose me.</verse>
  <verse number="10">If Timothy comes, see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you, for he is doing the work of the Lord, just as I am.</verse>
  <verse number="11">No one, then, should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he can return to me, for I am expecting him along with the brothers.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers. He was not at all inclined to go now, but he will go when he has the opportunity.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Be on the alert. Stand firm in the faith. Be men of courage. Be strong.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Do everything in love.</verse>
  <verse number="15">You know that Stephanas and his household were the first converts in Achaia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints. Now I urge you, brothers,</verse>
  <verse number="16">to submit to such as these, and to every fellow worker and laborer.</verse>
  <verse number="17">I am glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus have arrived, because they have supplied what was lacking from you.</verse>
  <verse number="18">For they refreshed my spirit and yours as well. Show your appreciation, therefore, to such men.</verse>
  <verse number="19">The churches in the province of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Prisca greet you warmly in the Lord, and so does the church that meets at their house.</verse>
  <verse number="20">All the brothers here send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.</verse>
  <verse number="21">This greeting is in my own hand—Paul.</verse>
  <verse number="22">If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be under a curse. Come, O Lord!</verse>
  <verse number="23">The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.</verse>
  <verse number="24">My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen.</verse>
