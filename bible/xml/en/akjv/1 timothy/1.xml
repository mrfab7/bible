<chapter book="1 Timothy" number="1" translation="American King James Version" translationID="akjv" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Savior, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;</verse>
  <verse number="2">To Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="3">As I sought you to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</verse>
  <verse number="4">Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:</verse>
  <verse number="6">From which some having swerved have turned aside to vain jangling;</verse>
  <verse number="7">Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</verse>
  <verse number="8">But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;</verse>
  <verse number="9">Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for murderers,</verse>
  <verse number="10">For fornicators, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for enslavers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;</verse>
  <verse number="11">According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;</verse>
  <verse number="13">Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
  <verse number="15">This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</verse>
  <verse number="16">However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="18">This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on you, that you by them might war a good warfare;</verse>
  <verse number="19">Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:</verse>
  <verse number="20">Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</verse>
