  <verse number="1">Wo to thee oppressing, and thou not oppressed; and spoiling, and they spoiled not upon thee! when thou finishing to oppress, thou shalt be oppressed; when thou ceasing to spoil, they shall spoil upon thee.</verse>
  <verse number="2">O Jehovah, pity us: we hoped for thee: be thou their arm for the mornings, also our salvation in time of straits.</verse>
  <verse number="3">From the voice of the multitude peoples fled; from thy lifting up, nations were scattered.</verse>
  <verse number="4">And your spoil was gathered the gathering of the locust: as the running about of locusts he ran to and fro upon it.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Jehovah was exalted; for he dwells On high: he filled Zion with judgment and justice.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And the stability of thy times, the strength of salvation, was wisdom and knowledge: the fear of Jehovah this his treasure.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Behold the lions of God they cried out without: the messengers of peace shall weep bitterness.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The highways lay waste, the traveler passing by, ceased: he brake the covenant, he despised the cities, he reckoned them not men.</verse>
  <verse number="9">The earth mourning, languished: Lebanon being ashamed, pined away: Sharon was as a sterile region, and Bashan was shaken, and Carmel.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Now will I rise, Jehovah will say; now will I be exalted; now will I be lifted up.</verse>
  <verse number="11">Ye shall conceive dry grass, ye shall bring forth straw: your spirit of fire shall consume you.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And peoples were the burnings of lime; thorns cut down, in fire shall they be burnt.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Hear, ye afar off, what I did and know, ye drawing near, my strength.</verse>
  <verse number="14">The sinners in Zion trembled; trembling seized the profane. Who to us shall sojourn with devouring fire? who to us with everlasting burning?</verse>
  <verse number="15">He going in justice and speaking uprightness, rejecting in the plunder of oppression; shaking his hands from holding upon a gift, shutting his ear from the hearing of bloods, and binding up his eyes from looking upon evil;</verse>
  <verse number="16">He shall dwell upon heights: the strongholds of rocks his height: his bread was given; his waters sure.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Thine eyes shall perceive the king in his beauty: they shall see the land from far off.</verse>
  <verse number="18">Thy heart shall meditate terror. Where the scribe? where the weigher? where he writing the towers?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Thou shalt not see a firm people, a people of a deep lip above hearing; of a stammering tongue, of no understanding.</verse>
  <verse number="20">Behold Zion the city of our appointment: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet dwelling, the tent shall not remove; its pegs shall not be pulled up forever, and none of its cords shall be broken.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But there the mighty Jehovah to us a place of rivers, rivers broad of hands; a ship with the oar shall not go in it, and a mighty ship shall not pass over it.</verse>
  <verse number="22">For Jehovah is our Judge, Jehovah our law-giver, Jehovah our king; he will save us.</verse>
  <verse number="23">Thy cords were broken in pieces; they will not well strengthen their mast; they spread not the flag: then was the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame plundered the plunder.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the inhabitant shall not say, I was sick: to the people dwelling in it, iniquity was lifted up.</verse>
