  <verse number="1">And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:</verse>
  <verse number="2">The first month, the first day of the month, thou shalt set up the tabernacle of the testimony,</verse>
  <verse number="3">And shalt put the ark in it, and shalt let down the veil before it:</verse>
  <verse number="4">And thou shalt bring in the table, and set upon it the things that are commanded according to the rite. The candlestick shall stand with its lamps,</verse>
  <verse number="5">And the altar of gold whereon the incense is burnt, before the ark of the testimony. Thou shalt put the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle,</verse>
  <verse number="6">And before it the altar of holocaust:</verse>
  <verse number="7">The laver between the altar and the tabernacle, and thou shalt fill it with water.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And thou shalt encompass the court with hangings, and the entry thereof.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And thou shalt take the oil of unction and anoint the tabernacle with its vessels, that they may be sanctified:</verse>
  <verse number="10">The altar of holocaust and all its vessels:</verse>
  <verse number="11">The laver with its foot: thou shalt consecrate all with the oil of unction, that they may be most holy.</verse>
  <verse number="12">And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, and having washed them with water,</verse>
  <verse number="13">Thou shalt put on them the holy vestments, that they may minister to me, and that the unction of them may prosper to an everlasting priesthood.</verse>
  <verse number="14"></verse>
  <verse number="15"></verse>
  <verse number="16">And Moses did all that the Lord had commanded.</verse>
  <verse number="17">So in the first month of the second year, the first day of the month, the tabernacle was set up.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And Moses reared it up, and placed the boards and the sockets and the bars, and set up the pillars,</verse>
  <verse number="19">And spread the roof over the tabernacle, putting over it a cover, as the Lord had commanded.</verse>
  <verse number="20">And he put the testimony in the ark, thrusting bars underneath, and the oracle above.</verse>
  <verse number="21">And when he had brought the ark into the tabernacle, he drew the veil before it to fulfil the commandment of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And he set the table in the tabernacle of the testimony at the north side without the veil,</verse>
  <verse number="23">Setting there in order the loaves of proposition, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="24">He set the candlestick also in the tabernacle of the testimony over against the table on the south side,</verse>
  <verse number="25">Placing the lamps in order, according to the precept of the Lord.</verse>
  <verse number="26">He set also the altar of gold under the roof of the testimony over against the veil,</verse>
  <verse number="27">And burnt upon it the incense of spices, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="28">And he put also the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle of the testimony,</verse>
  <verse number="29">And the altar of holocaust of the entry of the testimony, offering the holocaust, and the sacrifices upon it, as the Lord had commanded.</verse>
  <verse number="30">And he set the laver between the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar, filling it with water.</verse>
  <verse number="31">And Moses and Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet,</verse>
  <verse number="32">When they went into the tabernacle of the covenant, and went to the altar, as the Lord had commanded Moses.</verse>
  <verse number="33">He set up also the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, drawing the hanging in the entry thereof. After all things were perfected,</verse>
  <verse number="34">The cloud covered the tabernacle of the testimony, and the glory of the Lord filled it.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Neither could Moses go into the tabernacle of the covenant, the cloud covering all things and the majesty of the Lord shining, for the cloud had covered all.</verse>
  <verse number="36">If at any time the cloud removed from the tabernacle, the children of Israel went forward by their troops:</verse>
  <verse number="37">If it hung over, they remained in the same place.</verse>
  <verse number="38">For the cloud of the Lord hung over the tabernacle by day, and a fire by night, in the sight of all the children of Israel throughout all their mansions.</verse>
