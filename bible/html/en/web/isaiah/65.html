<div class="chapter" data-book="Isaiah" data-chapter="65" data-translation="World English Bible" data-translation-id="web" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">“I am inquired of by those who didn’t ask; I am found by those who didn’t seek me: I said, See me, see me, to a nation that was not called by my name.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense on bricks;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">who sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places; who eat pig’s flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">who say, Stand by yourself, don’t come near to me, for I am holier than you. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all the day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">“Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but will recompense, yes, I will recompense into their bosom,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together,” says Yahweh, “who have burned incense on the mountains, and blasphemed me on the hills; therefore will I first measure their work into their bosom.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Thus says Yahweh, “As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one says, ‘Don’t destroy it, for a blessing is in it:’ so will I do for my servants’ sake, that I may not destroy them all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down in, for my people who have sought me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">“But you who forsake Yahweh, who forget my holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who fill up mixed wine to Destiny;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">I will destine you to the sword, and you shall all bow down to the slaughter; because when I called, you didn’t answer; when I spoke, you didn’t listen; but you did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I didn’t delight.”</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, “Behold, my servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but you shall be disappointed;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but you shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for anguish of spirit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">You shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen; and the Lord Yahweh will kill you; and he will call his servants by another name:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">so that he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he who swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hidden from my eyes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">“For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create; for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people; and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">“There shall be no more there an infant of days, nor an old man who has not filled his days; for the child shall die one hundred years old, and the sinner being one hundred years old shall be accursed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">They shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity; for they are the seed of the blessed of Yahweh, and their offspring with them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">It shall happen that, before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent’s food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,” says Yahweh.</p>
