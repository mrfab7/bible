<p class="verse" data-verse="1">And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And I said, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And behold, the angel that talked with me went forth; and another angel went forth to meet him,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">and said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">and I, saith Jehovah, I will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Ho, ho! flee from the land of the north, saith Jehovah; for I have scattered you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, saith Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Ho! escape, Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: After the glory, hath he sent me unto the nations that made you a spoil; for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">For behold, I will shake my hand upon them, and they shall become a spoil to those that served them: and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Sing aloud and rejoice, daughter of Zion; for behold, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith Jehovah.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">And many nations shall join themselves to Jehovah in that day, and shall be unto me for a people; and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">And Jehovah shall inherit Judah [as] his portion in the holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Let all flesh be silent before Jehovah; for he is risen up out of his holy habitation.</p>
