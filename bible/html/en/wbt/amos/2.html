<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, I will not turn away their punishment: because they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after which their fathers have walked:</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away their punishment: because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go in to the same maid, to profane my holy name:</p>

<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.</p>
