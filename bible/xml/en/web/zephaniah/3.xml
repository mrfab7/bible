  <verse number="1">Woe to her who is rebellious and polluted, the oppressing city!</verse>
  <verse number="2">She didn’t obey the voice. She didn’t receive correction. She didn’t trust in Yahweh. She didn’t draw near to her God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Her princes in the midst of her are roaring lions. Her judges are evening wolves. They leave nothing until the next day.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Her prophets are arrogant and treacherous people. Her priests have profaned the sanctuary. They have done violence to the law.</verse>
  <verse number="5">Yahweh, in the midst of her, is righteous. He will do no wrong. Every morning he brings his justice to light. He doesn’t fail, but the unjust know no shame.</verse>
  <verse number="6">I have cut off nations. Their battlements are desolate. I have made their streets waste, so that no one passes by. Their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man, so that there is no inhabitant.</verse>
  <verse number="7">I said, “Just fear me. Receive correction, so that her dwelling won’t be cut off, according to all that I have appointed concerning her.” But they rose early and corrupted all their doings.</verse>
  <verse number="8">“Therefore wait for me,” says Yahweh, “until the day that I rise up to the prey, for my determination is to gather the nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour on them my indignation, even all my fierce anger, for all the earth will be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.</verse>
  <verse number="9">For then I will purify the lips of the peoples, that they may all call on the name of Yahweh, to serve him shoulder to shoulder.</verse>
  <verse number="10">From beyond the rivers of Cush, my worshipers, even the daughter of my dispersed people, will bring my offering.</verse>
  <verse number="11">In that day you will not be disappointed for all your doings, in which you have transgressed against me; for then I will take away out of the midst of you your proudly exulting ones, and you will no more be haughty in my holy mountain.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But I will leave in the midst of you an afflicted and poor people, and they will take refuge in the name of Yahweh.</verse>
  <verse number="13">The remnant of Israel will not do iniquity, nor speak lies, neither will a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth, for they will feed and lie down, and no one will make them afraid.”</verse>
  <verse number="14">Sing, daughter of Zion! Shout, Israel! Be glad and rejoice with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Yahweh has taken away your judgments. He has thrown out your enemy. The King of Israel, Yahweh, is in the midst of you. You will not be afraid of evil any more.</verse>
  <verse number="16">In that day, it will be said to Jerusalem, “Don’t be afraid, Zion. Don’t let your hands be weak.”</verse>
  <verse number="17">Yahweh, your God, is in the midst of you, a mighty one who will save. He will rejoice over you with joy. He will calm you in his love. He will rejoice over you with singing.</verse>
  <verse number="18">I will remove those who grieve about the appointed feasts from you. They are a burden and a reproach to you.</verse>
  <verse number="19">Behold, at that time I will deal with all those who afflict you, and I will save those who are lame, and gather those who were driven away. I will give them praise and honor, whose shame has been in all the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="20">At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you; for I will give you honor and praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I restore your fortunes before your eyes, says Yahweh.</verse>
