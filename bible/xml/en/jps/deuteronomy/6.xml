<chapter book="Deuteronomy" number="6" translation="JPS Tanakh 1917 OT" translationID="jps" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go over to possess it—</verse>
  <verse number="2">that thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all His statutes and His commandments, which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son, all the days of thy life; and that thy days may be prolonged.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD, the God of thy fathers, hath promised unto thee—a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
  <verse number="4">HEAR, O ISRAEL: THE LORD OUR GOD, THE LORD IS ONE.</verse>
  <verse number="5">And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.</verse>
  <verse number="6">And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart;</verse>
  <verse number="7">and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="9">And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thy house, and upon thy gates.</verse>
  <verse number="10">And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land which He swore unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee—great and goodly cities, which thou didst not build,</verse>
  <verse number="11">and houses full of all good things, which thou didst not fill, and cisterns hewn out, which thou the didst not hew, vineyards and olive-trees, which thou didst not plant, and thou shalt eat and be satisfied—</verse>
  <verse number="12">then beware lest thou forget the LORD, who brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; and Him shalt thou serve, and by His name shalt thou swear.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples that are round about you;</verse>
  <verse number="15">for a jealous God, even the LORD thy God, is in the midst of thee; lest the anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and He destroy thee from off the face of the earth.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Ye shall not try the LORD your God, as ye tried Him in Massah.</verse>
  <verse number="17">Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and His testimonies, and His statutes, which He hath commanded thee.</verse>
  <verse number="18">And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the LORD; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and possess the good land which the LORD swore unto thy fathers,</verse>
  <verse number="19">to thrust out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD hath spoken.</verse>
  <verse number="20">When thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying: ‘What mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which the LORD our God hath commanded you?</verse>
  <verse number="21">then thou shalt say unto thy son: ‘We were Pharaoh’s bondmen in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</verse>
  <verse number="22">And the LORD showed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his house, before our eyes.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And He brought us out from thence, that He might bring us in, to give us the land which He swore unto our fathers.</verse>
  <verse number="24">And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that He might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.</verse>
  <verse number="25">And it shall be righteousness unto us, if we observe to do all this commandment before the LORD our God, as He hath commanded us.’</verse>
