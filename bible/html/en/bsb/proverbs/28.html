<div class="chapter" data-book="Proverbs" data-chapter="28" data-translation="Berean Standard Bible" data-translation-id="bsb" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are as bold as a lion.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">A land in rebellion has many rulers, but a man of understanding and knowledge maintains order.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">A destitute leader who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain that leaves no food.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the law resist them.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Evil men do not understand justice, but those who seek the LORD comprehend fully.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Better a poor man who walks with integrity than a rich man whose ways are perverse.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">A discerning son keeps the law, but a companion of gluttons disgraces his father.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">He who increases his wealth by interest and usury lays it up for one who is kind to the poor.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Whoever turns his ear away from hearing the law, even his prayer is detestable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">He who leads the upright along the path of evil will fall into his own pit, but the blameless will inherit what is good.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">A rich man is wise in his own eyes, but a poor man with discernment sees through him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">When the righteous triumph, there is great glory, but when the wicked rise, men hide themselves.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">He who conceals his sins will not prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them will find mercy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Blessed is the man who is always reverent, but he who hardens his heart falls into trouble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked ruler over a helpless people.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">A leader who lacks judgment is also a great oppressor, but he who hates dishonest profit will prolong his days.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">A man burdened by bloodguilt will flee into the Pit; let no one support him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">He who walks with integrity will be kept safe, but whoever is perverse in his ways will suddenly fall.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The one who works his land will have plenty of food, but whoever chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">A faithful man will abound with blessings, but one eager to be rich will not go unpunished.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">To show partiality is not good, yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">A stingy man hastens after wealth and does not know that poverty awaits him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">He who rebukes a man will later find more favor than one who flatters with his tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">He who robs his father or mother, saying, “It is not wrong,” is a companion to the man who destroys.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">A greedy man stirs up strife, but he who trusts in the LORD will prosper.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">He who trusts in himself is a fool, but one who walks in wisdom will be safe.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">Whoever gives to the poor will not be in need, but he who hides his eyes will receive many curses.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">When the wicked come to power, people hide themselves; but when they perish, the righteous flourish.</p>
