<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a mighty wind?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">If thy children have sinned against him, and he have delivered them into the hand of their transgression:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">If thou wouldest seek diligently unto God, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">For inquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and apply thyself to that which their fathers have searched out:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Whilst it is yet in its greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hope of the godless man shall perish:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Whose confidence shall break in sunder, and whose trust is a spiderâ€™s web.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold fast thereby, but it shall not endure.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">He is green before the sun, and his shoots go forth over his garden.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">His roots are wrapped about the heap, he beholdeth the place of stones.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">If he be destroyed from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others spring.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he uphold the evil-doers.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">He will yet fill thy mouth with laughter, and thy lips with shouting.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the tent of the wicked shall be no more.</p>
