<p class="verse" data-verse="1">The words of king Lemuel; the oracle which his mother taught him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">What, my son? and what, O son of my womb, and what, O son of my vows?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes to say, Where is strong drink?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any that is afflicted.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto the bitter in soul:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Open thy mouth for the dumb, in the cause of all such as are left desolate.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and minister judgment to the poor and needy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">A virtuous woman who can find? for her price is far above rubies.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">The heart of her husband trusteth in her, and he shall have no lack of gain.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">She doeth him good and not evil all the days of her life.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">She seeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">She is like the merchant-ships; she bringeth her food from afar.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and their task to her maidens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">She girdeth her loins with strength, and maketh strong her arms.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">She perceiveth that her merchandise is profitable: her lamp goeth not out by night.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">She layeth her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">She spreadeth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">She is not afraid of the snow for her household; for all her household are clothed with scarlet.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">She maketh for herself carpets of tapestry; her clothing is fine linen and purple.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">She maketh linen garments and selleth them; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Strength and dignity are her clothing; and she laugheth at the time to come.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and the law of kindness is on her tongue.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Her children rise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her, saying:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her works praise her in the gates.</p>
