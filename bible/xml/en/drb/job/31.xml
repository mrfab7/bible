<chapter book="Job" number="31" translation="Douay-Rheims Bible" translationID="drb" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">I made a covenant with my eyes, that I would not so much as think upon a virgin.</verse>
  <verse number="2">For what part should God from above have in me, and what inheritance the Almighty from on high?</verse>
  <verse number="3">Is not destruction to the wicked, and aversion to them that work iniquity?</verse>
  <verse number="4">Doth not he consider my ways, and number all my steps?</verse>
  <verse number="5">If I have walked in vanity, and my foot hath made haste to deceit:</verse>
  <verse number="6">Let him weigh me in a just balance, and let God know my simplicity.</verse>
  <verse number="7">If my step hath turned out of the way, and if my heart hath followed my eyes, and if a spot hath cleaved to my hands:</verse>
  <verse number="8">Then let me sow and let another eat: and let my offspring be rooted out.</verse>
  <verse number="9">If my heart hath been deceived upon a woman, and if I have laid wait at my friend’s door:</verse>
  <verse number="10">Let my wife be the harlot of another, and let other men lie with her.</verse>
  <verse number="11">For this is a heinous crime, and a most grievous iniquity.</verse>
  <verse number="12">It is a fire that devoureth even to destruction, and rooteth up all things that spring.</verse>
  <verse number="13">If I have despised to abide judgment with my manservant, or my maidservant, when they had any controversy against me:</verse>
  <verse number="14">For what shall I do when God shall rise to judge? and when he shall examine, what shall I answer him?</verse>
  <verse number="15">Did not he that made me in the womb make him also: and did not one and the same form me in the womb?</verse>
  <verse number="16">If I have denied to the poor what they desired, and have made the eyes of the widow wait:</verse>
  <verse number="17">If I have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof:</verse>
  <verse number="18">(For from my infancy mercy grew up with me: and it came out with me from my mother’s womb :)</verse>
  <verse number="19">If I have despised him that was perishing for want of clothing, and the poor man that had no covering:</verse>
  <verse number="20">If his sides have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep:</verse>
  <verse number="21">If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, even when I saw myself superior in the gate:</verse>
  <verse number="22">Let my shoulder fall from its joint, and let my arm with its bones be broken.</verse>
  <verse number="23">For I have always feared God as waves swelling over me, and his weight I was not able to bear.</verse>
  <verse number="24">If I have thought gold my strength, and have said to fine gold: My confidence:</verse>
  <verse number="25">If I have rejoiced over my great riches, and because my hand had gotten much.</verse>
  <verse number="26">If I beheld the sun when it shined, and the moon going in brightness:</verse>
  <verse number="27">And my heart in secret hath rejoiced, and I have kissed my hand with my mouth:</verse>
  <verse number="28">Which is a very great iniquity, and a denial against the most high God.</verse>
  <verse number="29">If I have been glad at the downfall of him that hated me, and have rejoiced that evil had found him.</verse>
  <verse number="30">For I have not given my mouth to sin, by wishing a curse to his soul.</verse>
  <verse number="31">If the men of my tabernacle have not said: Who will give us of his flesh that we may be filled?</verse>
  <verse number="32">The stranger did not stay without, my door was open to the traveller.</verse>
  <verse number="33">If as a man I have hid my sin, and have concealed my iniquity in my bosom.</verse>
  <verse number="34">If I have been afraid at a very great multitude, and the contempt of kinsmen hath terrified me: and I have not rather held my peace, and not gone out of the door.</verse>
  <verse number="35">Who would grant me a hearer, that the Almighty may hear my desire; and that he himself that judgeth would write a book,</verse>
  <verse number="36">That I may carry it on my shoulder, and put it about me as a crown?</verse>
  <verse number="37">At every step of mine I would pronounce it, and offer it as to a prince.</verse>
  <verse number="38">If my land cry against me, and with it the furrows thereof mourn:</verse>
  <verse number="39">If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, and have afflicted the soul of the tillers thereof:</verse>
  <verse number="40">Let thistles grow up to me instead of wheat, and thorns instead of barley.</verse>
