  <verse number="1">This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Moab, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because he burned to lime the bones of Edom’s king.</verse>
  <verse number="2">So I will send fire against Moab to consume the citadels of Kerioth. Moab will die in tumult, amid war cries and the sound of the ram’s horn.</verse>
  <verse number="3">I will cut off the ruler of Moab and kill all the officials with him,” says the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="4">This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Judah, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they reject the Law of the LORD and fail to keep His statutes; they are led astray by the lies in which their fathers walked.</verse>
  <verse number="5">So I will send fire upon Judah to consume the citadels of Jerusalem.”</verse>
  <verse number="6">This is what the LORD says: “For three transgressions of Israel, even four, I will not revoke My judgment, because they sell the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals.</verse>
  <verse number="7">They trample on the heads of the poor as on the dust of the earth; they push the needy out of their way. A man and his father have relations with the same girl and so profane My holy name.</verse>
  <verse number="8">They lie down beside every altar on garments taken in pledge. And in the house of their God, they drink wine obtained through fines.</verse>

  <verse number="10">And I brought you up from the land of Egypt and led you forty years in the wilderness, that you might take possession of the land of the Amorite.</verse>
  <verse number="11">I raised up prophets from your sons and Nazirites from your young men. Is this not true, O children of Israel?” declares the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="12">“But you made the Nazirites drink wine and commanded the prophets not to prophesy.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Behold, I am about to crush you in your place as with a cart full of grain.</verse>
  <verse number="14">Escape will fail the swift, the strong will not prevail by his strength, and the mighty will not save his life.</verse>
  <verse number="15">The archer will not stand his ground, the fleet of foot will not escape, and the horseman will not save his life.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Even the bravest of mighty men will flee naked on that day,” declares the LORD.</verse>
