<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Then the scribes and Pharisees from Jerusalem come up to Jesus, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Why do thy disciples transgress what has been delivered by the ancients? for they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">But he answering said to them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God on account of your traditional teaching?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">For God commanded saying, Honour father and mother; and, He that speaks ill of father or mother, let him die the death.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or mother, It is a gift, whatsoever [it be] by which [received] from me thou wouldest be profited:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">and he shall in no wise honour his father or his mother; and ye have made void the commandment of God on account of your traditional teaching.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Hypocrites! well has Esaias prophesied about you, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">This people honour me with the lips, but their heart is far away from me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">but in vain do they worship me, teaching [as] teachings commandments of men.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And having called to [him] the crowd, he said to them, Hear and understand:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Not what enters into the mouth defiles the man; but what goes forth out of the mouth, this defiles the man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Then his disciples, coming up, said to him, Dost thou know that the Pharisees, having heard this word, have been offended?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">But he answering said, Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Leave them alone; they are blind leaders of blind: but if blind lead blind, both will fall into a ditch.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And Peter answering said to him, Expound to us this parable.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">But he said, Are ye also still without intelligence?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Do ye not yet apprehend, that everything that enters into the mouth finds its way into the belly, and is cast forth into the draught?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">but the things which go forth out of the mouth come out of the heart, and those defile man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">For out of the heart come forth evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnessings, blasphemies;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">these are the things which defile man; but the eating with unwashen hands does not defile man.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">And Jesus, going forth from thence, went away into the parts of Tyre and Sidon;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">and lo, a Canaanitish woman, coming out from those borders, cried [to him] saying, Have pity on me, Lord, Son of David; my daughter is miserably possessed by a demon.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came to [him] and asked him, saying, Dismiss her, for she cries after us.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">But he answering said, I have not been sent save to the lost sheep of Israelâ€™s house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">But she came and did him homage, saying, Lord, help me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">But he answering said, It is not well to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">But she said, Yea, Lord; for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from the table of their masters.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">Then Jesus answering said to her, O woman, thy faith [is] great. Be it to thee as thou desirest. And her daughter was healed from that hour.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="29">And Jesus, going away from thence, came towards the sea of Galilee, and he went up into the mountain and sat down there;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="30">and great crowds came to him, having with them lame, blind, dumb, crippled, and many others, and they cast them at his feet, and he healed them:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="31">so that the crowds wondered, seeing dumb speaking, crippled sound, lame walking, and blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="32">But Jesus, having called his disciples to [him], said, I have compassion on the crowd, because they have stayed with me already three days and they have not anything they can eat, and I would not send them away fasting lest they should faint on the way.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="33">And his disciples say to him, Whence should we have so many loaves in [the] wilderness as to satisfy so great a crowd?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="34">And Jesus says to them, How many loaves have ye? But they said, Seven, and a few small fishes.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="35">And he commanded the crowds to lie down on the ground;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="36">and having taken the seven loaves and the fishes, having given thanks, he broke [them] and gave [them] to his disciples, and the disciples to the crowd.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="37">And all ate and were filled; and they took up what was over and above of the fragments seven baskets full;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="38">but they that ate were four thousand men, besides women and children.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="39">And, having dismissed the crowds, he went on board ship and came to the borders of Magadan.</p>
