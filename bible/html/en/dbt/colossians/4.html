<p class="verse" data-verse="1">Masters, give to bondmen what is just and fair, knowing that ye also have a Master in [the] heavens.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Persevere in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">praying at the same time for us also, that God may open to us a door of the word to speak the mystery of Christ, on account of which also I am bound,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">to the end that I may make it manifest as I ought to speak.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Walk in wisdom towards those without, redeeming opportunities.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">[Let] your word [be] always with grace, seasoned with salt, [so as] to know how ye ought to answer each one.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow-bondman in [the] Lord, will make known to you all that concerns me;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, that he might know your state, and that he might encourage your hearts:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">with Onesimus, the faithful and beloved brother, who is [one] of you. They shall make known to you everything here.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Aristarchus my fellow-captive salutes you, and Mark, Barnabasâ€™s cousin, concerning whom ye have received orders, (if he come to you, receive him,)</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">and Jesus called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These [are the] only fellow-workers for the kingdom of God who have been a consolation to me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Epaphras, who is [one] of you, [the] bondman of Christ Jesus, salutes you, always combating earnestly for you in prayers, to the end that ye may stand perfect and complete in all [the] will of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For I bear him witness that he labours much for you, and them in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Luke, the beloved physician, salutes you, and Demas.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Salute the brethren in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the assembly which [is] in his house.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And when the letter has been read among you, cause that it be read also in the assembly of Laodiceans, and that ye also read that from Laodicea.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in [the] Lord, to the end that thou fulfil it.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace [be] with you.</p>
