  <verse number="1">Remind them to be subject to principalities and authorities, to obey rule, unto every good work to be ready,</verse>
  <verse number="2">of no one to speak evil, not to be quarrelsome—gentle, showing all meekness to all men,</verse>
  <verse number="3">for we were once—also we—thoughtless, disobedient, led astray, serving desires and pleasures manifold, in malice and envy living, odious—hating one another;</verse>
  <verse number="4">and when the kindness and the love to men of God our Saviour did appear</verse>
  <verse number="5">(not by works that are in righteousness that we did but according to His kindness,) He did save us, through a bathing of regeneration, and a renewing of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
  <verse number="6">which He poured upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour,</verse>
  <verse number="7">that having been declared righteous by His grace, heirs we may become according to the hope of life age-during.</verse>
  <verse number="8">Stedfast is the word; and concerning these things I counsel thee to affirm fully, that they may be thoughtful, to be leading in good works—who have believed God; these are the good and profitable things to men,</verse>
  <verse number="9">and foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about law, stand away from—for they are unprofitable and vain.</verse>
  <verse number="10">A sectarian man, after a first and second admonition be rejecting,</verse>
  <verse number="11">having known that he hath been subverted who is such, and doth sin, being self-condemned.</verse>
  <verse number="12">When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis, for there to winter I have determined.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Zenas the lawyer and Apollos bring diligently on their way, that nothing to them may be lacking,</verse>
  <verse number="14">and let them learn—ours also—to be leading in good works to the necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.</verse>
  <verse number="15">Salute thee do all those with me; salute those loving us in faith; the grace is with you all!</verse>
