  <verse number="1">There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</verse>
  <verse number="2">The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</verse>
  <verse number="3">Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?</verse>
  <verse number="5">Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and [of] the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
  <verse number="6">That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</verse>
  <verse number="8">The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</verse>
  <verse number="10">Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel, and knowest not these things?</verse>
  <verse number="11">Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</verse>
  <verse number="12">If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall ye believe, if I tell you [of] heavenly things?</verse>
  <verse number="13">And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, [even] the Son of man which is in heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:</verse>
  <verse number="15">That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.</verse>
  <verse number="16">For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.</verse>
  <verse number="18">He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</verse>
  <verse number="19">And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</verse>
  <verse number="20">For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</verse>
  <verse number="21">But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</verse>
  <verse number="22">After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</verse>
  <verse number="23">And John also was baptizing in AEnon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</verse>
  <verse number="24">For John was not yet cast into prison.</verse>
  <verse number="25">Then there arose a question between [some] of John’s disciples and the Jews about purifying.</verse>
  <verse number="26">And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all [men] come to him.</verse>
  <verse number="27">John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.</verse>
  <verse number="28">Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.</verse>
  <verse number="29">He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</verse>
  <verse number="30">He must increase, but I [must] decrease.</verse>
  <verse number="31">He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</verse>
  <verse number="32">And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man receiveth his testimony.</verse>
  <verse number="33">He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that God is true.</verse>
  <verse number="34">For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God giveth not the Spirit by measure [unto him].</verse>
  <verse number="35">The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</verse>
  <verse number="36">He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</verse>
