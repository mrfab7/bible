<p class="verse" data-verse="1">In those days was Hezekiah sick with a mortal disease. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thy house in order: for thou shalt die, and not live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">Then Hezekiah turned his face towards the wall, and prayed to the LORD,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept bitterly.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears: behold, I will add to thy days fifteen years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">And I will deliver thee and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">And this shall be a sign to thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which hath gone down on the sun-dial of Ahaz ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it had gone down.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and had recovered from his sickness:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">My age hath departed, and is removed from me as a shepherdâ€™s tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Like a crane or a swallow, so I chattered: I mourned as a dove: my eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">What shall I say? he hath both spoken to me, and himself hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">O Lord, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaster upon the boil, and he will recover.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?</p>
