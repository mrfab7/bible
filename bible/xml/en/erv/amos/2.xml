  <verse number="1">Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Moab, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:</verse>
  <verse number="2">but I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet:</verse>
  <verse number="3">and I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="4">Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Judah, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have rejected the law of the LORD, and have not kept his statutes, and their lies have caused them to err, after the which their fathers did walk:</verse>
  <verse number="5">but I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</verse>
  <verse number="6">Thus saith the LORD: For three transgressions of Israel, yea, for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have sold the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of shoes:</verse>
  <verse number="7">that pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father will go unto the same maid, to profane my holy name:</verse>
  <verse number="8">and they lay themselves down beside every altar upon clothes taken in pledge, and in the house of their God they drink the wine of such as have been fined.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</verse>
  <verse number="10">Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.</verse>
  <verse number="11">And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazirites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of Israel? saith the LORD.</verse>
  <verse number="12">But ye gave the Nazirites wine to drink; and commanded the prophets, saying, Prophesy not.</verse>
  <verse number="13">Behold, I will press you in your place, as a cart presseth that is full of sheaves.</verse>
  <verse number="14">And flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver himself:</verse>
  <verse number="15">neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that rideth the horse deliver himself:</verse>
  <verse number="16">and he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, saith the LORD.</verse>
