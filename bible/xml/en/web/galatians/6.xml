<chapter book="Galatians" number="6" translation="World English Bible" translationID="web" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Brothers, even if a man is caught in some fault, you who are spiritual must restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to yourself so that you also aren’t tempted.</verse>
  <verse number="2">Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For if a man thinks himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</verse>
  <verse number="4">But let each man test his own work, and then he will take pride in himself and not in his neighbor.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For each man will bear his own burden.</verse>
  <verse number="6">But let him who is taught in the word share all good things with him who teaches.</verse>
  <verse number="7">Don’t be deceived. God is not mocked, for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap.</verse>
  <verse number="8">For he who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption. But he who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Let us not be weary in doing good, for we will reap in due season, if we don’t give up.</verse>
  <verse number="10">So then, as we have opportunity, let’s do what is good toward all men, and especially toward those who are of the household of the faith.</verse>
  <verse number="11">See with what large letters I write to you with my own hand.</verse>
  <verse number="12">As many as desire to look good in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</verse>
  <verse number="13">For even they who receive circumcision don’t keep the law themselves, but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may boast in your flesh.</verse>
  <verse number="14">But far be it from me to boast, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</verse>
  <verse number="15">For in Christ Jesus neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</verse>
  <verse number="16">As many as walk by this rule, peace and mercy be on them, and on God’s Israel.</verse>
  <verse number="17">From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body.</verse>
  <verse number="18">The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.</verse>
