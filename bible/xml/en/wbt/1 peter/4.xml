<chapter book="1 Peter" number="4" translation="Webster Bible Translation" translationID="wbt" language="English" languageID="en">
  <verse number="1">Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;</verse>
  <verse number="2">That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.</verse>
  <verse number="3">For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine, revelings, banquetings, and abominable idolatries:</verse>
  <verse number="4">In which they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:</verse>
  <verse number="5">Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead.</verse>
  <verse number="6">For, for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</verse>
  <verse number="7">But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober, and watch to prayer.</verse>
  <verse number="8">And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity will cover a multitude of sins.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Use hospitality one to another without grudging.</verse>
  <verse number="10">As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</verse>
  <verse number="11">If any man speaketh let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man ministereth let him do it as of the ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ; to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
  <verse number="12">Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you:</verse>
  <verse number="13">But rejoice, seeing ye are partakers of Christ’s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.</verse>
  <verse number="14">If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you. On their part he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.</verse>
  <verse number="15">But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evil-doer, or as a busy-body in other men’s matters.</verse>
  <verse number="16">Yet if any man suffereth as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; but let him glorify God on this behalf.</verse>
  <verse number="17">For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first beginneth at us, what will be the end of them that obey not the gospel of God?</verse>
  <verse number="18">And if the righteous is scarcely saved, where will the ungodly and the sinner appear?</verse>
  <verse number="19">Wherefore, let them that suffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing, as to a faithful Creator.</verse>
