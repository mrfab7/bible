<div class="chapter" data-book="Daniel" data-chapter="6" data-translation="American King James Version" data-translation-id="akjv" data-language="English" data-language-id="en">
<p class="verse" data-verse="1">It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first: that the princes might give accounts to them, and the king should have no damage.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; for as much as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus to him, King Darius, live for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of you, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which alters not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">Why king Darius signed the writing and the decree.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">Then they came near, and spoke before the king concerning the king’s decree; Have you not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of you, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which alters not.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regards not you, O king, nor the decree that you have signed, but makes his petition three times a day.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he labored till the going down of the sun to deliver him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">Then these men assembled to the king, and said to the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establishes may be changed.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spoke and said to Daniel, Your God whom you serve continually, he will deliver you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">And a stone was brought, and laid on the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning Daniel.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of music brought before him: and his sleep went from him.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice to Daniel: and the king spoke and said to Daniel, O Daniel, servant of the living God, is your God, whom you serve continually, able to deliver you from the lions?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Then said Daniel to the king, O king, live for ever.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">My God has sent his angel, and has shut the lions’ mouths, that they have not hurt me: for as much as before him innocence was found in me; and also before you, O king, have I done no hurt.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found on him, because he believed in his God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">Then king Darius wrote to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the living God, and steadfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even to the end.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="27">He delivers and rescues, and he works signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="28">So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Persian.</p>
