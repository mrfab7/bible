<p class="verse" data-verse="1">My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory with respect of persons.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="2">For if there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden ring, in fine apparel, and there shall come in also a poor man in mean attire,</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="3">And you have respect to him that is clothed with the fine apparel, and shall say to him: Sit thou here well; but say to the poor man: Stand thou there, or sit under my footstool:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="4">Do you not judge within yourselves, and are become judges of unjust thoughts?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="5">Hearken, my dearest brethren: hath not God chosen the poor in this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="6">But you have dishonoured the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you by might? and do not they draw you before the judgment seats?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="7">Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="8">If then you fulfil the royal law, according to the scriptures, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; you do well.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="9">But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, being reproved by the law as transgressors.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="10">And whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="11">For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="12">So speak ye, and so do, as being to be judged by the law of liberty.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="13">For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy. And mercy exalteth itself above judgment.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="14">What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="15">And if a brother or sister be naked, and want daily food:</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="16">And one of you say to them: Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body, what shall it profit?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="17">So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="18">But some man will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without works; and I will shew thee, by works, my faith.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="19">Thou believest that there is one God. Thou dost well: the devils also believe and tremble.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="20">But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="21">Was not Abraham our father justified by works, offering up Isaac his son upon the altar?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="22">Seest thou, that faith did co-operate with his works; and by works faith was made perfect?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="23">And the scripture was fulfilled, saying: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him to justice, and he was called the friend of God.</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="24">Do you see that by works a man is justified; and not by faith only?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="25">And in like manner also Rahab the harlot, was not she justified by works, receiving the messengers, and sending them out another way?</p>
<p class="verse" data-verse="26">For even as the body without the spirit is dead; so also faith without works is dead.</p>
