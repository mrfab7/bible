  <verse number="1">God, who in ancient days spoke to our forefathers in many distinct messages and by various methods through the Prophets,</verse>
  <verse number="2">has at the end of these days spoken to us through a Son, who is the pre-destined Lord of the universe, and through whom He made the Ages.</verse>
  <verse number="3">He brightly reflects God’s glory and is the exact representation of His being, and upholds the universe by His all-powerful word. After securing man’s purification from sin He took His seat at the right hand of the Majesty on high,</verse>
  <verse number="4">having become as far superior to the angels as the Name He possesses by inheritance is more excellent than theirs.</verse>
  <verse number="5">For to which of the angels did God ever say, “My Son art Thou: I have this day become Thy Father;” and again, “I will be a Father to Him, and He shall be My Son”?</verse>
  <verse number="6">But speaking of the time when He once more brings His Firstborn into the world, He says, “And let all God’s angels worship Him.”</verse>
  <verse number="7">Moreover of the angels He says, “He changes His angels into winds, and His ministering servants into a flame of fire.”</verse>
  <verse number="8">But of His Son, He says, “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and for ever, and the sceptre of Thy Kingdom is a sceptre of absolute justice.</verse>
  <verse number="9">Thou hast loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, Thy God, has anointed Thee with the oil of gladness beyond Thy companions.”</verse>
  <verse number="10">It is also of His Son that God says, “Thou, O Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Thy hands.</verse>
  <verse number="11">The heavens will perish, but Thou remainest; and they will all grow old like a garment,</verse>
  <verse number="12">and, as though they were a mantle Thou wilt roll them up; yes, like a garment, and they will undergo change. But Thou art the same, and Thy years will never come to an end.”</verse>
  <verse number="13">To which of the angels has He ever said, “Sit at My right hand till I make Thy foes a footstool for Thy feet”?</verse>
  <verse number="14">Are not all angels spirits that serve Him—whom He sends out to render service for the benefit of those who, before long, will inherit salvation?</verse>
